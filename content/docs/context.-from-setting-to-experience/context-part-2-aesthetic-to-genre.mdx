# Part 2: From Aesthetic to Genre

## Prerequisites: You've Chosen Your Aesthetics

This chapter assumes you've read **Chapter 1: Understanding Game Systems** (Section 2: The Twelve Aesthetics) and identified your aesthetic goals using the MDA framework plus our four expansions.

**Quick reminder - The 12 Aesthetics:**

**MDA's Original Eight:**

1. **Sensation** - Sensory pleasure, beauty, visceral immersion
2. **Fantasy** - Make-believe, imagining yourself in another world
3. **Narrative** - Story and drama
4. **Challenge** - Obstacle course, overcoming difficulty
5. **Fellowship** - Social framework, playing with others
6. **Discovery** - Exploration, finding new things
7. **Expression** - Self-discovery, creativity
8. **Submission** - Pastime, relaxation, "turning brain off"

**Our Four Expansions:**
9\. **Mastery** - Deep system understanding and optimization (distinct from Challenge: not just overcoming but understanding deeply)
10\. **Tension** - Adrenaline, time pressure, high-stakes decisions (distinct from Sensation: psychological pressure not sensory pleasure)
11\. **Progression** - Growth, becoming more powerful over time (distinct from Expression: advancement not creativity)
12\. **Collection** - Accumulation, completionism, "gotta catch 'em all" (distinct from Discovery: possessing not finding)

**If you haven't chosen your primary aesthetic yet, stop here and read Chapter 1 first.**

## The Two-Layer Framework

Context has two layers that designers often confuse:

**Layer 1: GENRE (Load-Bearing)**

* The structural type of experience you're creating
* Mystery investigation, horror survival, political thriller, power fantasy
* Determines what mechanics you need
* Determines how systems should work
* **Cannot be easily swapped without redesign**

**Layer 2: DRESSING (Cosmetic)**

* The surface aesthetics and setting flavor
* Star Wars, medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, Victorian London
* Provides player attachment and recognition
* Creates visual/tonal consistency
* **Can often be swapped without changing core experience**

**The critical insight:** Most designers think "I'm making a Star Wars game" tells them what to build. It doesn't. "I'm making a political thriller (genre) in Star Wars dressing" tells them what to build.

***

## The Star Wars Proof

Consider three productions in the same universe:

### Star Wars: A New Hope (1977)

**Genre:** Fantasy hero's journey (Campbell's monomyth)

**What this genre needs:**

* Mentor relationship (Obi-Wan teaching Luke)
* Power growth through trials (Force training)
* Moral choice (temptation of dark side)
* Destiny/prophecy elements (Chosen One narrative)
* Coming of age arc (farm boy to hero)

**Dressing:** Space opera (starships, lightsabers, aliens)

**Could be reskinned as:**

* Medieval fantasy (wizard training apprentice)
* Eastern martial arts film (master/student)
* Superhero origin story (great power/great responsibility)

**The genre is load-bearing. The dressing is cosmetic.**

### Rogue One (2016)

**Genre:** War movie (suicide mission, ensemble cast)

**What this genre needs:**

* Squad-based tactics (different specialists)
* High lethality (characters die)
* Resource scarcity (desperate odds)
* Mission objectives > character survival
* Gritty, grounded combat

**Dressing:** Star Wars universe (same as above)

**Could be reskinned as:**

* WWII mission (The Dirty Dozen)
* Modern military (Black Hawk Down)
* Heist gone wrong (Heat)

**Different genre, same universe. Needs completely different mechanics.**

### Andor (2022)

**Genre:** Political thriller/espionage

**What this genre needs:**

* Information gathering (spy networks)
* Social maneuvering (alliances, betrayals)
* Consequences of choices (rebellion has costs)
* Slow-burn tension (paranoia, surveillance)
* Systemic corruption (fighting the system)

**Dressing:** Star Wars universe (same as above)

**Could be reskinned as:**

* Cold War espionage (The Americans)
* Cyberpunk corporate resistance (Mr. Robot)
* Historical resistance movement (any occupied nation)

**Same dressing, three completely different genres, three completely different mechanics needed.**

***

## Why This Matters for Design

**Wrong approach (most designers):**
"I want to make a Star Wars game!"
→ Builds space battles, lightsabers, Force powers
→ Doesn't know what experience to create
→ Ends up with incoherent mix or space coffee

**Right approach:**
"I want Discovery + Narrative aesthetics"
→ These serve mystery investigation genre
→ Mystery investigation could be Star Wars dressing
→ Need investigation mechanics, clue systems, deduction
→ Apply Star Wars flavor to those mechanics

**The genre determines what you build. The dressing determines what it looks like.**

***

## The Complete Decision Process

### Step 1: Identify Your Aesthetics

**Question 1: What's your PRIMARY aesthetic?**

Pick ONE. This is your north star. Everything serves this.

**Quick self-test:**
□ Players should primarily feel sensory pleasure and beauty → **Sensation**
□ Players should primarily feel immersed in another identity → **Fantasy**
□ Players should primarily feel engaged with dramatic story → **Narrative**
□ Players should primarily feel satisfaction from overcoming obstacles → **Challenge**
□ Players should primarily feel connected with other players → **Fellowship**
□ Players should primarily feel joy of discovering new things → **Discovery**
□ Players should primarily feel creative self-expression → **Expression**
□ Players should primarily feel relaxed and unwinding → **Submission**
□ Players should primarily feel deep understanding and optimization → **Mastery**
□ Players should primarily feel adrenaline and high stakes → **Tension**
□ Players should primarily feel character growth and power → **Progression**
□ Players should primarily feel completionist satisfaction → **Collection**

**Question 2: What are your SECONDARY aesthetics?**

Pick 1-2 that support your primary. Most good games serve 2-3 aesthetics.

**Common pairings that work:**

* Challenge + Mastery (Dark Souls, Into the Breach)
* Narrative + Discovery (Disco Elysium, Outer Wilds)
* Fellowship + Challenge (Left 4 Dead, Deep Rock Galactic)
* Submission + Progression (idle games, casual RPGs)
* Discovery + Narrative (mystery games, Return of the Obra Dinn)
* Tension + Challenge (horror survival, permadeath roguelikes)

**Pairings that conflict:**

* ❌ Submission + Tension (can't relax AND be tense)
* ❌ Challenge + Submission (can't be difficult AND turn-brain-off)
* ⚠️ Fellowship + Mastery (social time vs optimization - possible but requires careful balance)

***

### Step 2: Filter Genres by Aesthetic

**For each aesthetic, certain genres naturally create that experience.**

Use this matrix to find candidate genres:

## Aesthetic-Genre Compatibility Matrix

### SENSATION (Sensory pleasure, beauty, flow)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Rhythm/Music games (Guitar Hero, Beat Saber)
* Action spectacle (Devil May Cry, Bayonetta)
* Atmospheric exploration (Journey, ABZÛ)
* Sensory puzzles (Tetris Effect, Lumines)

**Why these work:**

* Direct audiovisual feedback to every action
* Immediate gratification (beautiful response NOW)
* Flow state through rhythm
* Synaesthetic design (sound + visuals unified)

**Key mechanics:**

* Responsive audiovisual feedback
* Rhythm/timing as core
* Minimal cognitive load (attention on sensation)
* Aesthetic coherence (every element reinforces beauty)

**Dressing flexibility:** VERY HIGH - works in any setting

***

### FANTASY (Make-believe immersion)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Power fantasy (God of War, Destiny)
* Role-playing (D\&D, Mass Effect)
* World simulation (The Sims, Animal Crossing)
* Escapist adventure (Zelda, Skyrim)

**Why these work:**

* Player agency (you ARE the character)
* Consistent internal logic (world feels real)
* Wish fulfillment (be something you're not)
* Character identity mechanics (make them yours)

**Key mechanics:**

* First/second person perspective
* Character customization and identity
* World reactivity (NPCs acknowledge you)
* Progression tied to character growth

**Dressing flexibility:** MEDIUM - needs specific world to inhabit

***

### NARRATIVE (Story and drama)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Dramatic arc stories (The Last of Us, Disco Elysium)
* Branching narratives (Telltale games, Detroit: Become Human)
* Mystery investigation (Obra Dinn, Her Story)
* Political intrigue (Crusader Kings, Blades in the Dark)
* Tragedy/Loss (That Dragon Cancer, To the Moon)

**Why these work:**

* Consequences matter (choices affect story)
* Character development through play
* Dramatic structure (setup, conflict, resolution)
* Emotional stakes (care about outcomes)

**Key mechanics:**

* Choice with narrative consequences
* Character-driven conflicts
* Story state tracking (remembers what happened)
* Pacing that serves dramatic beats

**Dressing flexibility:** MEDIUM-HIGH

* Genre (drama, tragedy, intrigue) is load-bearing
* Dressing (space, medieval, modern) is cosmetic

**Critical insight for this aesthetic:**

* Andor and Game of Thrones = same genre (political intrigue), different dressing
* This is WHERE genre/dressing distinction becomes clearest

***

### CHALLENGE (Overcoming obstacles)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Tactical combat (XCOM, Into the Breach)
* Precision platforming (Celeste, Super Meat Boy)
* Puzzle solving (Portal, The Witness)

* Fair failure (understand why you lost)
* Mastery curve (getting better feels good)

**Key mechanics:**

* Clear win/loss conditions
* Consistent rules (pattern learning possible)
* Difficulty calibration
* Low-friction failure (quick retry)

**Dressing flexibility:** VERY HIGH

* Chess (abstract), Dark Souls (gothic), Portal (sci-fi) all work
* Genre determines challenge structure
* Dressing is almost entirely cosmetic

***

### FELLOWSHIP (Social interaction)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Cooperative survival (Left 4 Dead, Deep Rock Galactic)
* Social deduction (Among Us, Werewolf/Mafia)
* Party games (Mario Party, Jackbox)

* Shared goals or competition (binding force)
* Social dynamics emerge naturally

**Key mechanics:**

* Simple individual mechanics (brainspace for socializing)
* Communication channels enabled
* Clear roles or asymmetry
* Visible game state (enables discussion)

**Dressing flexibility:** HIGH

* Sci-fi crew vs medieval villagers creates different social dynamics
* But Fellowship works in many settings

***

### DISCOVERY (Finding new things)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Mystery investigation (Outer Wilds, Return of the Obra Dinn)
* Exploration (Subnautica, Metroidvania)
* Archaeological discovery (Heaven's Vault, 80 Days)
* Scientific experimentation (Opus Magnum, SpaceChem)

* "Aha!" moments (revelation satisfaction)
* Interconnected discoveries (fragments form whole)

**Key mechanics:**

* Non-linear exploration (player-driven)
* Environmental storytelling (clues in world)
* Knowledge accumulation (discoveries persist)
* Internal consistency (investigation yields truth)

**Dressing flexibility:** MEDIUM

* Needs mysterious/unknown elements
* Works best with: Ruins, alien worlds, historical mysteries, scientific frontiers
* Generic modern settings harder (less mystery)

***

### EXPRESSION (Creativity and self-discovery)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Creative building (Minecraft, Terraria)
* Character customization (Fashion Souls, Sims)
* Deck building (Slay the Spire, Dominion)
* Base/City design (Factorio, Cities: Skylines)

* Exhibition of creativity (show others)
* Identity through choices (build reflects you)

**Key mechanics:**

* Rich option space (many combinations)
* No optimal solution (preference matters)
* Sharing/exhibition mechanics (optional)
* Aesthetic feedback (creations look/feel different)

**Dressing flexibility:** VERY HIGH

* Medieval castle building = Sci-fi base = Abstract deck construction
* Genre (building, customization) is load-bearing
* Dressing is cosmetic

***

### SUBMISSION (Relaxation and pastime)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Idle/Incremental (Cookie Clicker, Adventure Capitalist)
* Cozy life sim (Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley)
* Meditative puzzles (Flow, Monument Valley)
* Casual match-3 (Bejeweled, Candy Crush)

* Pleasant feedback (satisfying not stressful)

**Key mechanics:**

* No failure states or very forgiving
* Gentle progression (always moving forward)
* Optional optimization (can engage more if wanted)
* Calm aesthetic (soothing presentation)

**Dressing flexibility:** HIGH

* Pastoral farming, space gardening, abstract zen
* Tone matters more than specific setting

***

### MASTERY (Deep optimization)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Competitive skill games (Fighting games, RTS, MOBA)
* Deep strategy (Chess, Go, Poker)
* Routing/Speedrunning (any game with skill ceiling)
* Build crafting (Path of Exile, Factorio)
* Pattern mastery (Dark Souls, Sekiro, rhythm games at high level)

**Why these work:**

* High skill ceiling (always room to improve)
* Learnable systems (study yields understanding)
* Optimization space (multiple approaches, some better)
* Measurable improvement (track getting better)
* Depth reveals itself (beginners see surface, experts see complexity)

**Key mechanics:**

* Consistent rules (pattern learning possible)
* Transparent cause-effect (understand why)
* Scalable difficulty (challenges grow with skill)
* Optimization metrics (DPS, win rate, time)
* Punishment for suboptimal play (incentive to master)

**Key distinction from Challenge:**

* Challenge = overcoming difficulty once
* Mastery = understanding deeply, optimizing, getting better over time

**Dressing flexibility:** VERY HIGH

* Chess (abstract), StarCraft (sci-fi), Street Fighter (martial arts)
* Genre is load-bearing, dressing is cosmetic

***

### TENSION (Adrenaline and high stakes)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Horror survival (Alien: Isolation, Resident Evil, Dead Space)
* Real-time pressure (StarCraft, They Are Billions, FTL)
* Permadeath roguelikes (XCOM Ironman, Hades, Slay the Spire)
* Thriller/Suspense (Hitman stealth, Dishonored)
* Battle royale (PUBG, Escape from Tarkov)
* Ticking clock scenarios (This War of Mine, Frostpunk)

**Why these work:**

* High stakes (meaningful consequences)
* Limited time (can't deliberate forever)
* Permanent or costly failure (death matters)
* Information pressure (threat present but not fully known)
* Resource scarcity (can't afford mistakes)

**Key mechanics:**

* Time pressure (real-time OR turn limits)
* Permanent/slow-recovering losses
* Threat escalation (gets worse over time)
* Limited safety nets
* Imperfect information (can't see everything)

**Key distinction from Sensation:**

* Sensation = sensory pleasure (feels good)
* Tension = psychological pressure (feels intense)

**Dressing flexibility:** MEDIUM

* Needs contexts that support stakes
* Works: Horror, survival, warfare, heists, disasters
* Doesn't work: Cozy pastoral, peaceful exploration

***

### PROGRESSION (Character growth and power)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Skill-based progression (RuneScape, Old School RuneScape)
* RPG leveling (most RPGs, Diablo, Destiny)
* Incremental/Idle (Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes)
* Empire building (Civilization, 4X games)
* Metroidvania (gaining abilities that open world)
* Roguelite (meta-progression between runs)

**Why these work (RuneScape player perspective):**

* Visible mastery of disciplines (99 in a skill means something)
* Multiple parallel goals (don't like combat? Train fishing)
* Permanent milestones (every level stays achieved)
* Clear long-term projects (quest cape, max cape)
* Self-directed pacing (grind when you want)
* Community recognition (everyone knows what 99 Runecraft means)
* Meditation through repetition (grinding is zen)

**Key mechanics:**

* Multiple progression tracks (not just one "level")
* Exponential time investment (later levels harder = meaningful)
* Visible status symbols (skill capes, achievements)
* Activity variety within grind
* Prestige tiers (99 → 120 → 200M XP)

**Key distinction from Mastery:**

* Mastery = player improves (execution skill)
* Progression = character improves (time investment)
* RuneScape has BOTH: Getting 99s (progression) + tick manipulation (mastery)

**Dressing flexibility:** VERY HIGH

* Fantasy skills, space progression, idle bakery all work
* But context must support multiple progression tracks

***

### COLLECTION (Completionism)

**Genres that naturally serve:**

* Monster/Creature collecting (Pokemon, Temtem, Cassette Beasts)
* Achievement hunting (most modern games with achievements)
* Card collecting (Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone)
* Collectathon platformers (Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario Odyssey)
* Catalogue completion (Breath of the Wild shrines/Korok seeds)
* Set completion (Destiny exotics, loot games)

**Why these work:**

* Finite set (can be completed)
* Clear checklist (know what's missing)
* Rarity tiers (common to legendary)
* Hunting satisfaction (finding the rare one)
* Completion reward (100% achievement)
* Exhibition (show off to others)

**Key mechanics:**

* Catalogue/collection tracking (see what you have/need)
* Variety in obtainment (different methods)
* Rarity system (some harder than others)
* Completionist rewards (bonus for getting all)
* Trading/showcase (optional but enhances)

**Key distinction from Discovery:**

* Discovery = finding something new and learning about it
* Collection = possessing all instances of known types
* Discovery = knowledge, Collection = ownership

**Dressing flexibility:** HIGH

* Creatures, cards, weapons, achievements, locations
* But context must support collectible identity (distinct items)

***

### Step 3: Apply Your Constraints

**You now have candidate genres for your aesthetics. Filter by real-world constraints.**

#### Time Constraints

**Monthly, 2-hour sessions:**

* ✅ Episodic genres (each session = complete story)
* ✅ Mystery (one case per session)
* ❌ Long tactical combat (can't finish)
* ❌ Empire building (needs continuity)

**Weekly, 4-hour sessions:**

* ✅ Most genres work
* ✅ Campaign structures
* ✅ Tactical combat

**Daily, 30-minute sessions:**

* ✅ Incremental/Idle
* ✅ Quick puzzles
* ❌ Deep strategy (setup too long)
* ❌ Long narrative arcs

**Decision rule:**

```
IF session < 2 hours AND infrequent (monthly)
  THEN prefer: Episodic, quick resolution
  AVOID: Long tactical, continuous campaigns

IF session > 3 hours AND frequent (weekly+)
  THEN: Most genres viable

IF session < 1 hour AND frequent (daily)
  THEN prefer: Incremental, quick challenges
  AVOID: Setup-heavy genres
```

#### Player Count Constraints

**Solo play:**

* ✅ Discovery, Challenge, Mastery, Progression, Submission
* ⚠️ Fellowship (need AI or solo procedures)
* ✅ Narrative (solo investigation, personal story)

**2-4 players:**

* ✅ All genres work
* ✅✅ Fellowship genres excel
* ✅ Cooperative or competitive

**5+ players:**

* ✅ Party games, social deduction
* ✅ MMO raiding, large cooperative
* ⚠️ Deep strategy (analysis paralysis)
* ❌ Intimate narrative (too many voices)

**Decision rule:**

```
IF solo
  THEN: Discovery, Mastery, Challenge, Narrative, Progression
  NEED: AI/oracle for social genres

IF 2-4 players
  THEN: Any genre works
  CONSIDER: Cooperative or competitive?

IF 5+ players
  THEN prefer: Party, social deduction, large coop
  AVOID: Deep strategic planning
```

#### Format Constraints

**Digital (computer/console):**

* ✅ All genres
* ✅✅ Real-time pressure (automation handles speed)
* ✅✅ Complex tracking (no manual bookkeeping)
* ✅ LLM integration possible

**Tabletop (pen & paper):**

* ✅ Most genres
* ⚠️ Real-time pressure (hard without computer)
* ⚠️ Complex tracking (GM burden)
* ✅ Social interaction easier

**Hybrid (VTT + humans):**

* ✅ Best of both
* ✅ Automation + social
* ✅ LLM integration natural

**Decision rule:**

```
IF tabletop
  THEN prefer: Turn-based, manageable tracking
  AVOID: Real-time pressure, excessive calculation

IF digital
  THEN: All formats viable
  LEVERAGE: Automation

IF hybrid
  THEN: Strategic automation use
  BEST: LLM for narrative, computer for mechanics
```

#### Cognitive Load Budget

**From Chapter 3 - How much thinking can players handle?**

**High load budget:**

* ✅ Mastery (optimization requires thinking)
* ✅ Deep strategy
* ✅ Complex puzzles
* Players expect to think hard

**Medium load budget:**

* ✅ Tactical combat
* ✅ Narrative choices
* ✅ Discovery (investigation)

**Low load budget:**

* ✅ Submission (by definition)
* ✅ Progression (grinding is meditation)
* ✅ Simple mechanics
* Players want to relax

**Decision rule:**

```
IF players want low cognitive load
  THEN prefer: Submission, simple Progression, casual Collection
  AVOID: Deep strategy, complex Mastery

IF players want high cognitive load
  THEN prefer: Mastery, complex Challenge, Discovery
  EMBRACE: Depth and optimization

IF players have variable load (tired after work, energetic weekends)
  THEN: Design for low-load baseline with optional depth
  OR: Provide difficulty modes
```

***

### Step 4: Choose Your Genre

**You now have:**

* ✅ Aesthetics identified (primary + secondary)
* ✅ Candidate genres filtered by aesthetics
* ✅ Constraints applied (time/players/format/load)

**Result: 1-3 candidate genres remain**

**If multiple candidates:**
Choose based on:

* Personal preference/passion (which excites you?)
* Understanding (which do you know best?)
* Fewer pitfalls (which is less risky?)
* Player feedback (which do they want?)

**If zero candidates:**
Your aesthetics or constraints conflict.

Options:

* Adjust aesthetics (pick different secondary)
* Adjust constraints (if possible)
* Accept hybrid complexity (harder but possible)

**If one clear candidate:**
Proceed confidently. The decision tree worked.

***

## Worked Example: Discovery + Narrative

**Designer input:**

* Primary: Discovery
* Secondary: Narrative
* Constraints: Solo play, 2-hour sessions, monthly
* Load budget: Medium

**Step 1: Genres for Discovery**

* Mystery investigation ✓
* Exploration ✓
* Archaeological discovery ✓
* Scientific experimentation ✓
* Interconnected revelation ✓

**Step 2: Which also serve Narrative?**

* Mystery investigation ✓✓ (serves both well)
* Archaeological discovery ✓ (can serve both)
* Exploration ⚠️ (Discovery yes, Narrative weak)
* Scientific experimentation ⚠️ (Discovery yes, Narrative weak)
* Interconnected revelation ✓ (can serve both)

**Step 3: Apply constraints (solo, 2 hours, monthly)**

* Mystery investigation ✓ (solo works, 2-hour cases possible, episodic)
* Archaeological discovery ✓ (solo works, episodic discoveries)
* Interconnected revelation ✓ (solo investigation, episodic clues)
* Exploration ❌ (needs longer sessions)

**Step 4: Final candidates**

* Mystery investigation
* Archaeological discovery
* Interconnected revelation

**Step 5: Choose based on preference**
"I love detective stories" → **Mystery investigation**

**Result: Mystery investigation genre selected**

***

### Step 5: Separate Genre from Dressing

**You have chosen a GENRE (load-bearing).**

**Now choose DRESSING (cosmetic).**

**Critical distinction:**

* Genre = what creates the experience
* Dressing = what it looks like

**Mystery Investigation genre can wear many dressings:**

* Victorian London (Sherlock Holmes)
* Modern forensics (CSI)
* Fantasy magic (Dresden Files)
* Space station (sci-fi murder mystery)
* Historical period (Name of the Rose)

**All are MYSTERY INVESTIGATION at core. Dressing is interchangeable.**

**How to choose dressing:**

**Question 1: What excites you/players?**

* "We love Star Wars" → Space opera dressing
* "We just read Foundation" → Asimov-style sci-fi
* "We want hobbits" → Tolkien-style fantasy

**Question 2: Does dressing support genre?**

**Good fit:**

* Mystery + Victorian London ✓ (established trope)
* Horror + haunted house ✓ (natural fit)
* Power fantasy + superhero ✓ (genre expectation)

**Possible but requires work:**

* Mystery + cozy pastoral ⚠️ (unusual, needs careful framing)
* Horror + bright cheerful ⚠️ (tonal conflict)
* Tragedy + cartoon animals ⚠️ (possible but hard)

**Actively conflicts:**

* Submission aesthetic + grimdark dressing ❌
* Cozy life sim + apocalyptic wasteland ❌
* Relaxation + violent combat dressing ❌

**Question 3: Is dressing actually cosmetic here?**

**Test:** "Could I swap dressing without changing genre?"

**Example: Rogue One**

* Genre: War movie
* Dressing: Star Wars
* Test: Could be WWII, Vietnam, modern warfare
* **Result: Dressing is cosmetic** ✓

**Example: Disco Elysium**

* Genre: Political thriller
* Dressing: Revachol (specific poverty, specific politics)
* Test: Could be... different city? Maybe, but politics matter
* **Result: Dressing is partially load-bearing** ⚠️

**When in doubt: Assume dressing is cosmetic until proven otherwise.**

***

## Complete Decision Summary

**The process (one page):**

**1. IDENTIFY AESTHETICS**

* Primary: \[one aesthetic]
* Secondary: \[1-2 supporting aesthetics]

**2. FILTER GENRES**

* List genres for primary aesthetic (use matrix)
* Filter to those serving secondary
* Result: \[candidate genres]

**3. APPLY CONSTRAINTS**

* Time: \[hours per session, frequency]
* Players: \[solo, 2-4, 5+]
* Format: \[digital, tabletop, hybrid]
* Load: \[high, medium, low]
* Result: \[viable genres]

**4. CHOOSE GENRE**

* Pick from viable genres
* Based on: passion, understanding, fewer pitfalls
* Result: \[chosen genre]

**5. SEPARATE GENRE/DRESSING**

* Genre = load-bearing (creates experience)
* Dressing = cosmetic (looks)
* Choose dressing: preference + genre support
* Result: \[genre + dressing]

**6. PROCEED TO CONTEXT DESIGN**

* Next: Parts 3-6 (building actual context)
* You know WHAT to build
* Need to decide HOW MUCH to build

***

## Validation Checklist

**Before proceeding, verify:**

□ **Aesthetic-Genre Fit**

* Does this genre naturally create my primary aesthetic?
* Does it also serve secondary aesthetics?

□ **Constraint Compatibility**

* Can we actually run this in available time?
* Does it work with our player count?
* Is it feasible in our format?

□ **Cognitive Load Match**

* Does this genre's natural load fit our budget?
* Are we asking for right amount of thinking?

□ **Genre-Dressing Separation**

* Do I know what's load-bearing vs cosmetic?
* Could I explain genre without mentioning dressing?
* Is my dressing choice actually cosmetic or partially load-bearing?

□ **No Conflicting Aesthetics**

* Am I trying to serve contradictory aesthetics?
* Do my aesthetics actually work together?

**If all checked: Proceed to Part 3**

**If any unchecked: Revisit that step**

***

## What You've Accomplished

You've systematically moved from abstract aesthetic goals to concrete genre choice:

✅ **Identified aesthetics** (primary + secondary)
✅ **Filtered genres** using aesthetic compatibility
✅ **Applied constraints** (time/players/format/load)
✅ **Chosen genre** (load-bearing structure)
✅ **Separated dressing** (cosmetic layer)
✅ **Validated choices** (everything aligns)

**You now know:**

* What experience you're creating (aesthetic)
* What structural type serves it (genre)
* What surface flavor you want (dressing)
* That your choice is feasible (constraints satisfied)

**Next step: Validate your context actually matters.**

***

**Next: Part 3 - The Space Coffee Test**

How to test if your context is load-bearing or just decoration, with five levels from pure cosmetic to context-as-system.
