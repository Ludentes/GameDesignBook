# Part 11: Quick Reference and Decision Tools

## One-Page Process Summary

### The Complete Context Design Process

**INPUT:** Aesthetic goal(s) from Chapter 1 (Section 2: The Twelve Aesthetics) + Constraints

**STEP 1: Choose Genre (Part 2)**

* Identify primary + secondary aesthetics
* Filter genres by aesthetic compatibility
* Apply constraints (time, players, format, cognitive load)
* Choose genre (load-bearing structure)
* Separate from dressing (cosmetic layer)

**STEP 2: Define Perspective (Part 4)**

* Articulate the overall feeling you're creating
* Define what maintains this perspective
* Identify what breaks this perspective
* Create red flags list

**STEP 3: Apply Space Coffee Test (Part 3)**

* Could you reskin without changing experience?
* What level: Cosmetic, Shallow, Mechanical Flavor, Constrains, IS System?
* Validate genre choice is load-bearing

**STEP 4: Create Content Inventory (Part 6)**

* List major elements (locations, NPCs, events, lore)
* For each element: Build/Suggest/Omit decisions
* Document rationale (how it serves perspective)
* Apply genre-appropriate ratios

**STEP 5: Define World Rules (Part 6)**

* Physical rules (what's possible/impossible)
* Social rules (culture, power structures)
* Gameplay rules (what players need to know)
* Validate against perspective

**STEP 6: Plan Integration (Part 8)**

* Connect to Resources (Chapter 2)
* Connect to Balance Paradigm (Chapter 4)
* Connect to Cognitive Load (Chapter 3)
* Ensure mechanics reinforce context
* Check coherence across all systems

**STEP 7: Validate Dynamics (Part 7)**

* What behaviors will emerge?
* Do these dynamics serve aesthetic?
* Any contradictions?
* Test against expected player actions

**STEP 8: Coherence Check (Part 8)**

* Genre serves primary aesthetic? ✓
* Perspective maintained throughout? ✓
* Build/Suggest/Omit ratios fit aesthetic? ✓
* Resources explained by context? ✓
* Balance paradigm fits genre? ✓
* Cognitive load appropriate? ✓
* No contradictory signals? ✓

**STEP 9: Create Content (Part 6)**

* Write based on Build decisions
* Hint based on Suggest decisions
* Deliberately omit based on Omit decisions
* Maintain perspective throughout

**STEP 10: Playtest and Validate (Part 9)**

* Observe behaviors (match aesthetic?)
* Ask specific questions (by aesthetic)
* Check for perspective breaks
* Iterate based on synthesis validation

**OUTPUT:** Context that transforms mechanics into meaningful experience

## Decision Flowcharts

### Genre Selection Flowchart

```
START: I have aesthetic goal(s) + constraints

↓

List genres for PRIMARY aesthetic
(use matrix above)

↓

Filter: Which also serve SECONDARY aesthetic(s)?

↓

Apply CONSTRAINTS:
├─ Time available? (monthly 2hr vs weekly 4hr)
├─ Player count? (solo vs 2-4 vs 5+)
├─ Format? (digital vs tabletop vs hybrid)
└─ Cognitive load budget? (high vs medium vs low)

↓

Remaining candidates: 1-3 genres

↓

IF multiple remain:
Choose based on:
- Personal passion
- Understanding depth
- Fewer pitfalls
- Excitement level

IF zero remain:
- Adjust secondary aesthetics, OR
- Adjust constraints (if possible), OR
- Accept hybrid complexity

↓

RESULT: Genre chosen (load-bearing)

↓

Choose DRESSING (cosmetic):
- What setting excites you/players?
- Does it support genre? (check for conflicts)
- Is it actually cosmetic? (test by swapping)

↓

DONE: Genre + Dressing ready for design document
```

***

### Build/Suggest/Omit Decision Tree

```
For each context element (location, NPC, event, lore):

↓

QUESTION 1: Is this mechanically necessary?
(Do players need it for gameplay decisions?)

YES → Lean toward BUILD
NO → Continue

↓

QUESTION 2: Does mystery enhance or obstruct?

ENHANCES (creates investigation/wonder) → SUGGEST or OMIT
OBSTRUCTS (creates confusion/frustration) → BUILD

↓

QUESTION 3: Does specificity help or harm?

Full detail enhances immersion → BUILD
Glimpses enable imagination → SUGGEST
Full view breaks mystery/fear → OMIT

↓

QUESTION 4: Is this multiplayer?
(Need shared understanding for coordination?)

YES → BUILD enough for coordination
NO → Free to SUGGEST or OMIT

↓

QUESTION 5: What's your primary aesthetic?

Challenge/Mastery → BUILD (clarity needed)
Discovery/Mystery → SUGGEST (investigation is game)
Horror/Tension → OMIT (fear of unknown)
Narrative → BALANCE (context + mystery + drama)
Submission → BUILD (clarity = comfort)
Fellowship → BUILD (shared understanding)

↓

DECISION: BUILD / SUGGEST / OMIT

↓

Document rationale: "This serves [perspective] because..."
```

### Perspective Maintenance Checklist

**Before creating ANY content, ask:**

□ **Does this element serve my perspective?**

* Perspective: \[Your one-sentence feeling/framing]
* This element: \[Specific piece]
* Serves? YES → Keep / NO → Cut or reframe

□ **Could this break the perspective?**

* Horror + comedy? (alien pratfalls)
* Mystery + randomness? (dice-chosen solution)
* Cozy + threat? (sudden danger)
* If YES → Eliminate or carefully reframe

□ **Does this fit genre expectations?**

* Mystery genre → Investigation mechanics present?
* Horror genre → Unknown maintained?
* Challenge genre → Fair rules established?
* If NO → Redesign element

□ **Is Build/Suggest/Omit ratio appropriate?**

* Too much Build? (overwhelming exposition)
* Too little Build? (confusion about basics)
* Right amount of Suggest? (can form theories)
* Appropriate Omit? (mystery serves aesthetic)

□ **Does this integrate with other systems?**

* Resources explained by context?
* Balance paradigm fits genre?
* Cognitive load appropriate?
* Mechanics reinforce context?

## When to Use What

### High Build Situations

**Use when:**

* Challenge aesthetic (need clarity for fairness)
* Mastery aesthetic (need transparency for optimization)
* Fellowship aesthetic (need shared understanding)
* Multiplayer coordination required
* Mechanical necessities
* Core facts for gameplay

**Examples:**

* Dark Souls boss patterns (must be learnable)
* Into the Breach enemy moves (must be predictable)
* Catan resource types (must be clear)
* Left 4 Dead special infected abilities (team coordination)

***

### High Suggest Situations

**Use when:**

* Discovery aesthetic (investigation is the game)
* Mystery genre (clues to connect)
* Narrative aesthetic (motivations to infer)
* Wonder aesthetic (fragments create beauty)
* Solo play (imagination fills gaps)

**Examples:**

* Outer Wilds Nomai story (fragments across planets)
* Obra Dinn identities (deduced from clues)
* Weather Factory cosmology (hints in card text)
* Disco Elysium your past (pieced together)

***

### High Omit Situations

**Use when:**

* Horror/Tension aesthetic (fear of unknown)
* Submission aesthetic (hide complexity)
* Wonder aesthetic (preserve mystery)
* Explanation would break perspective
* Information serves aesthetic better absent

**Examples:**

* Alien motivation (unknowable = terrifying)
* Quantum phenomena in Outer Wilds (experienced not explained)
* Book of Hours complexity (hidden bookkeeping)
* Final cosmic mysteries (some questions stay open)

***

### Balanced Situations

**Use when:**

* Narrative aesthetic (context + mystery + drama)
* Fantasy aesthetic (consistency + wonder)
* Expression aesthetic (tools + creativity)
* Multiple aesthetics served

**Examples:**

* Blades in the Dark (explicit factions + suggested consequences + omitted full conspiracy)
* Disco Elysium (exhaustive Martinaise + suggested past + omitted world outside)
* Slay the Spire (clear mechanics + build discovery + hidden RNG specifics)

***

## Common Patterns by Genre

### Mystery Investigation

* Build: Crime scene, physical evidence, NPC statements
* Suggest: Motivations, connections, hidden relationships
* Omit: Solution (until deduced), some red herrings stay ambiguous
* Dynamic: Players investigate, form theories, deduce

### Horror Survival

* Build: Survival rules, immediate threats, escape routes
* Suggest: Threat nature (glimpses, sounds, traces)
* Omit: Full explanation, creature perspective, weaknesses
* Dynamic: Players proceed cautiously, avoid threats, feel tension

### Cozy Life Sim

* Build: Activities, NPCs, world systems
* Suggest: Backstories, optional depth
* Omit: Threats, complexity, pressure, darkness
* Dynamic: Players relax, explore freely, engage at own pace

### Tactical Challenge

* Build: All mechanics, enemy abilities, map information
* Suggest: Advanced strategies, optimization paths
* Omit: Almost nothing (transparency required)
* Dynamic: Players learn patterns, optimize, master execution

### Political Intrigue

* Build: Factions, current conflicts, available information
* Suggest: Hidden agendas, long-term consequences, motivations
* Omit: Full conspiracy, all NPC secrets, future events
* Dynamic: Players maneuver, gather information, make alliances

***

* "How were we supposed to know?" ✗ (arbitrary)
* Players ignore investigation? ✗ (mechanics wrong)

**Cozy Check:**

* Players visibly relaxed? ✓
* Players multitasking comfortably? ✓
* Players tense or worried? ✗ (hidden pressure)
* Players afraid to experiment? ✗ (stakes too high)

## The Essential Questions

**Before you build anything, answer these:**

1. **What's my primary aesthetic?** \[One answer]
2. **What genre creates this aesthetic?** \[From matrix]
3. **What's my perspective in one sentence?** \[Clear statement]
4. **What breaks this perspective?** \[Forbidden list]
5. **What must I Build?** \[Mechanical necessities]
6. **What should I Suggest?** \[Mysteries to investigate]
7. **What must I Omit?** \[Information that breaks perspective]
8. **How does this integrate?** \[Resources, Balance, Mechanics]
9. **What dynamics will emerge?** \[Player behaviors]
10. **Does everything align?** \[Coherence check]

**If you can't answer these clearly, you're not ready to create content.**

***

***

## Where to Go from Here

**You've completed Context chapter. Next steps:**

**If designing new game:**
→ Use templates to create your context design document
→ Begin content creation with perspective in mind
→ Validate early and often (Part 9 synthesis)

**If fixing existing game:**
→ Run Space Coffee Test (Part 3)
→ Check perspective maintenance (Part 4)
→ Identify what breaks coherence (Part 8)
→ Rebuild what contradicts

**For all designers:**
→ Review Pitfalls (Part 10) regularly
→ Use this Quick Reference during design
→ Validate with synthesis approach (Part 9)
→ Remember: Perspective trumps "realism"

***

## The Core Principle (Repeated)

**Context is not decoration.**

**Context transforms mechanics into meaning.**

When everything aligns—genre, perspective, Build/Suggest/Omit, integration, dynamics—you get:

* Weather Factory's opposite feelings from same mechanics
* Outer Wilds' cosmic wonder through strategic restraint
* Obra Dinn's satisfying deduction through careful clue placement
* Book of Hours' tranquil meditation through gentle framing

When things contradict—wrong genre, broken perspective, incoherent signals—you get:

* Andromeda's expensive irrelevant detail
* D\&D 4e's mechanical excellence that felt wrong
* Space coffee that could be reskinned without changing anything

**Design context that matters.**

**Make every element serve your perspective.**

**Cut ruthlessly what breaks the feeling you're creating.**

**That's how context transforms experience.**
