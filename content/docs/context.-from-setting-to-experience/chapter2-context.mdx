# Chapter 2: Context - Archetype, Setting, and Medium

In 2018, Weather Factory released _Cultist Simulator_—a card-based game about occult horror and forbidden knowledge. Players combine cards representing concepts (Fascination, Dread, Funds) with verb slots (Study, Work, Dream) on timers. The experience is paranoid, tense, filled with dread.

In 2023, Weather Factory released _Book of Hours_—a card-based game about library restoration. Players combine cards representing concepts (Books, Skills, Comfort) with the same verb slots (Study, Work, Dream) on the same timers. The experience is tranquil, meditative, pleasant.

**Same mechanics. Identical system architecture. Completely opposite experiences.**

The difference isn't the mechanics—it's the **context**: the thematic framing that transforms identical mechanical interactions into fundamentally different player experiences. In _Cultist Simulator_, drawing a card creates dread (what forbidden knowledge will corrupt me?). In _Book of Hours_, drawing a card creates contentment (what pleasant book will I discover?).

Context is not decoration painted over mechanics. Context transforms mechanics into meaning. It shapes what players feel, what they prioritize, and how they behave. Get context wrong, and you create what we call "space coffee"—elaborate settings that don't affect gameplay. Get it right, and you create experiences players can't get anywhere else.

This chapter shows you how to design context that matters—context chosen to serve your aesthetic goals, not just because it seems cool.

## Why Context Matters: The Space Coffee Problem

**Space coffee** describes lazy worldbuilding where contemporary concepts are simply prefixed with "space" without meaningful transformation. Space elevators. Space bureaucracy. Space capitalism. These aren't adaptations to new realities—they're Earth with "space" painted on.

Game designers make the same mistake constantly.

**Mass Effect: Andromeda** cost approximately $100 million and featured multiple detailed alien planets with unique biomes, several alien species with extensive backstories, hundreds of codex entries, and carefully crafted exploration lore. None of it mattered to gameplay. The gather-resources loop, combat encounters, quest structures, and companion mechanics worked identically regardless of sci-fi dressing. You could reskin it as fantasy continent exploration without changing a single system.

The setting was space coffee. Expensive, detailed, beautiful space coffee that didn't affect the game.

Compare **Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition** (2008). Mechanically excellent: balanced martial and caster classes, elegant tactical combat, streamlined rules. But it lost "the D&D feel." The mechanics screamed tactical board game while the context promised D&D fantasy adventure. This dissonance was fatal. Pathfinder (a 3.5e fork) outsold it. 5th Edition completely reversed course.

The lesson: You can have mechanically superior systems that fail because context and mechanics don't align. Technical excellence doesn't save you if context doesn't deliver the intended experience.

**The critical question: Does your setting actually matter, or is it just paint?**

## The Four Context Dimensions

Context isn't a single monolithic choice. It's four independent dimensions that combine to create your game's experiential framework:

### Dimension 1: Aesthetic (Experiential Goal)

**From Chapter 1:** What experience you want players to have.

**Examples:** Challenge, Discovery, Tension, Submission, Mastery, Narrative, Fellowship, Progression, Collection, Expression, Sensation.

**Already chosen:** You selected your primary aesthetic in Chapter 1.

**Role:** Determines everything else. Your aesthetic goal dictates which archetype serves it, which setting reinforces it, and which medium enables it.

**Example:** Tension aesthetic (you want players to feel adrenaline and high stakes).

### Dimension 2: Archetype (Structural Pattern)

**What it is:** The structural pattern that defines how your game works—the game's fundamental mechanical architecture.

**Examples:** Investigation, Tactical combat, Roguelike, Survival, Metroidvania, 4X strategy, Puzzle, Walking simulator, Heist planning, Social deduction.

**Load-bearing:** Archetype determines what mechanics you need. Investigation requires evidence gathering and deduction mechanics. Tactical combat requires positioning and action economy. You cannot swap archetypes without redesigning core systems.

**Medium-agnostic:** The same archetype works in different media. Investigation works in video games (Return of the Obra Dinn), TTRPGs (Call of Cthulhu), and board games (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective).

**Example:** Investigation archetype (gathering evidence, forming theories, solving mysteries).

### Dimension 3: Setting (Thematic Layer)

**What it is:** The fictional world's thematic and aesthetic presentation—what it looks like, sounds like, and feels like.

**Examples:** Gothic horror, cosmic horror, noir detective, cyberpunk, medieval fantasy, space opera, western, contemporary urban fantasy.

**Largely cosmetic:** Settings can often swap without changing core experience. Fantasy investigation and sci-fi investigation use identical mechanics—evidence gathering, clue analysis, deduction. The setting provides flavor, not structure.

**Reinforces aesthetic:** Good settings amplify your intended aesthetic. Gothic castles reinforce Tension. Cozy cottages reinforce Submission. But setting alone doesn't create the aesthetic—archetype and mechanics do.

**Example:** Gothic horror setting (dark castles, Victorian era, supernatural elements).

### Dimension 4: Medium (Platform)

**What it is:** Where players experience your game.

**Examples:** Video game, TTRPG, board game, mobile game, web game.

**Constrains possibilities:** Different media enable different mechanics. Video games can automate complex calculations. TTRPGs enable infinite GM flexibility. Board games provide tangible physical components. Mobile games require short sessions and simple interfaces.

**Not the same as platform:** Video game is a medium; PC/console/mobile are platforms within that medium.

**Example:** Video game medium (enables automation, real-time responses, persistent state).

### Key Insight: These Are Independent Dimensions

**You can combine them freely:**

- **Tension aesthetic + Investigation archetype + Gothic horror setting + Video game medium** = Horror investigation game (Amnesia: The Dark Descent)
- **Tension aesthetic + Investigation archetype + Sci-fi setting + Video game medium** = Sci-fi horror investigation (SOMA)
- **Discovery aesthetic + Investigation archetype + Fantasy setting + TTRPG medium** = Fantasy mystery campaign

**Same archetype + aesthetic, different settings = similar mechanics, different flavor.**

This independence is crucial. Most designers conflate these dimensions—"I'm making a Star Wars game" tells you setting but nothing about archetype or aesthetic. "I'm making a political thriller (archetype) for Narrative aesthetic (experience) in Star Wars setting (flavor)" tells you what to build.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - This four-dimension framework is validated across synthesis work and resolves longstanding ambiguities in game design terminology.

## The Star Wars Proof: Setting vs. Archetype

Consider three productions in the same fictional universe:

### Star Wars: A New Hope (1977)

**Archetype:** Hero's journey (Campbell's monomyth structure)

**Aesthetic:** Progression + Fantasy (becoming powerful, living another identity)

**What this archetype requires:**

- Mentor relationship (Obi-Wan teaching Luke)
- Power growth through trials (Force training)
- Moral choices (temptation of dark side)
- Destiny/prophecy elements (Chosen One)
- Coming-of-age arc (farm boy to hero)

**Setting:** Space opera

**Could be reskinned as:**

- Medieval fantasy (wizard training apprentice)
- Eastern martial arts film (master teaching student)
- Superhero origin story (great power, great responsibility)

### Rogue One (2016)

**Archetype:** War movie (suicide mission, ensemble cast)

**Aesthetic:** Tension + Fellowship (high stakes, squad bonding)

**What this archetype requires:**

- Squad-based tactics (different specialists)
- High lethality (permanent death)
- Resource scarcity (desperate odds)
- Mission objectives over individual survival
- Gritty, grounded combat

**Setting:** Star Wars universe (same as above)

**Could be reskinned as:**

- WWII mission (The Dirty Dozen)
- Modern military operation (Black Hawk Down)
- Heist gone wrong (Heat)

### Andor (2022)

**Archetype:** Political thriller/espionage

**Aesthetic:** Narrative + Discovery (unfolding story, uncovering secrets)

**What this archetype requires:**

- Information gathering (spy networks)
- Social maneuvering (alliances, betrayals)
- Consequence tracking (rebellion has costs)
- Slow-burn tension (paranoia, surveillance)
- Systemic corruption (fighting the system)

**Setting:** Star Wars universe (same as above)

**Could be reskinned as:**

- Cold War espionage (The Americans)
- Cyberpunk corporate resistance (Mr. Robot)
- Historical resistance movement (any occupied nation)

**Same setting. Three completely different archetypes. Three completely different mechanics needed.**

The setting (Star Wars) is cosmetic—it provides visual identity and player recognition. The archetype (hero's journey, war movie, political thriller) is load-bearing—it determines what mechanics create the intended experience.

**Wrong approach:** "I want to make a Star Wars game!" → Unclear what to build, no experiential direction.

**Right approach:** "I want Narrative + Discovery aesthetics → Political thriller archetype serves these → Star Wars setting reinforces → Need information gathering, social maneuvering, consequence mechanics."

## From Aesthetic to Archetype: The Decision Framework

You've chosen your primary aesthetic in Chapter 1. Now choose the archetype that serves it.

### The Selection Process

**Step 1: Identify Aesthetic-Compatible Archetypes**

Different archetypes naturally serve different aesthetics. Use this matrix to find candidates:

**CHALLENGE AESTHETIC** (Overcoming obstacles through skill)

Compatible archetypes:

- **Tactical combat:** Positioning, resource optimization, pattern recognition (XCOM, Into the Breach, Fire Emblem)

- **Crafting/Tech trees:** Unlocking complexity, capability expansion (Minecraft, Subnautica)

What these require: Advancement systems, unlock structures, power curves, persistence.

**[LLM-INTEGRATION-OPPORTUNITY: Automated archetype recommendation from aesthetic profiles. Given primary + secondary aesthetics, LLM could suggest archetypes, explain why each fits, and highlight potential conflicts. Requires training on archetype-aesthetic mappings with example validation.]**

**Step 2: Evaluate Archetype Candidates**

For each compatible archetype, ask:

□ **Does this archetype naturally create my primary aesthetic?**

- If YES clearly → Strong candidate
- If MAYBE with work → Possible but risky
- If NO → Wrong archetype

□ **Does this archetype support my secondary aesthetics?**

- Challenge + Mastery → Need archetype with depth (tactical combat, deck builder)
- Narrative + Discovery → Need archetype with investigation (mystery, branching narrative)
- Tension + Fellowship → Need archetype with shared threat (co-op survival)

□ **Do I have the resources to build this archetype?**

- Investigation requires extensive content creation (clues, locations, mysteries)
- 4X strategy requires complex systems and balancing
- MMO requires server infrastructure and ongoing content
- Choose archetype you can actually complete

□ **Does this archetype work in my chosen medium?**

- Real-time action requires video game automation
- Investigation works across all media
- Social deduction requires live players (TTRPG or multiplayer)
- Idle/Incremental better suited to mobile or web

**Step 3: Choose One Archetype**

**Pick ONE primary archetype.** Mixing archetypes without clear hierarchy creates incoherent experiences.

**Good:** Investigation archetype with light combat (Disco Elysium—investigation is primary, combat is minimal)

**Good:** Tactical combat with investigation between battles (Fire Emblem—combat is primary, investigation provides context)

**Bad:** 50/50 investigation + tactical combat with no priority (pulls in opposite directions)

**Your archetype is now locked.** This determines what mechanics you build in Chapter 3 (Resources) and beyond.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Aesthetic-archetype mappings are validated across many games but some aesthetics support multiple archetypes equally well. Context-dependent optimization required.

## Choosing Setting: Reinforcement, Not Creation

Once you've chosen archetype from aesthetic goals, select setting that reinforces—but doesn't create—the experience.

### Setting Selection Principles

**Principle 1: Setting Reinforces Aesthetic, Doesn't Create It**

**Wrong thinking:** "Gothic castles = automatic horror"

- No. Gothic setting + cozy simulation archetype = Cozy mystery in castle (not horror)
- Setting provides flavor. Archetype creates experience.

**Right thinking:** "Horror survival archetype creates Tension. Gothic castles reinforce."

- Archetype creates vulnerability and threat (Tension)
- Gothic setting amplifies through atmosphere
- Together they work, but archetype is load-bearing

**Principle 2: Many Settings Serve Same Archetype**

Investigation archetype works with:

- Gothic horror setting (Sherlock Holmes)
- Noir detective setting (LA Noire)
- Fantasy setting (The Name of the Wind)
- Sci-fi setting (Blade Runner)
- Contemporary setting (True Detective)

All use identical investigation mechanics—evidence gathering, clue analysis, deduction. Setting provides flavor, not structure.

**Principle 3: Choose Setting That Won't Fight Your Archetype**

**Compatible pairings:**

- Survival archetype + harsh environment setting (frozen wasteland, alien planet)
- Cozy simulation + pastoral setting (countryside, small town)
- Political thriller + urban setting (cities, institutions)
- Investigation + mysterious setting (gothic, noir, cosmic horror)

**Incompatible pairings:**

- Cozy simulation + grimdark war setting (tone clash)
- Horror survival + comedic cartoon setting (perspective clash)
- Serious drama + absurdist setting (intention clash)

### The Setting Selection Process

**Option A: Choose Setting That Naturally Amplifies Your Aesthetic**

**For Tension aesthetic:**

- Isolation settings (space station, arctic base, abandoned facility)
- Hostile environments (alien worlds, post-apocalypse)
- Confined spaces (submarine, spaceship, bunker)

**For Discovery aesthetic:**

- Mysterious ancient civilizations (ruins, lost cities)
- Unexplored territories (new planets, uncharted islands)
- Layered history (archaeological sites, secret societies)

**For Submission aesthetic:**

- Pastoral and safe (countryside, small towns, gardens)
- Familiar and comfortable (home, café, library)
- Gentle fantasy (cottagecore, solarpunk, studio Ghibli aesthetic)

**For Challenge aesthetic:**

- Competitive arenas (tournament, league, championship)
- Extreme conditions (hostile planets, dangerous dungeons)
- Clear conflicts (war, competition, survival)

**Option B: Choose Setting Based on Player Recognition**

**Licensed IPs:**

- Star Wars, Middle-earth, Marvel, etc.
- Players have existing attachment
- Setting expectations already established
- Must choose appropriate archetype for IP (don't violate what makes IP recognizable)

**Familiar genre settings:**

- Medieval fantasy (D&D tradition)
- Cyberpunk (Blade Runner, Neuromancer)
- Post-apocalypse (Mad Max, Fallout)
- Players understand conventions
- Can subvert expectations if intentional

**Option C: Create Original Setting**

**Advantages:**

- Complete creative control
- No player expectations to violate
- Can design setting specifically for archetype

**Disadvantages:**

- Must establish everything from scratch
- No built-in player recognition
- Higher cognitive load (players learning new world)

**Decision framework:**

- High aesthetic reinforcement need → Choose Option A (setting amplifies experience)
- Player base values familiarity → Choose Option B (recognize conventions)
- Unique vision important → Choose Option C (original world)

### Testing Setting Choice: The Reskin Test

**Question: Could I reskin this game to a different setting without changing mechanics?**

**If YES easily:**

- Setting is cosmetic (fine if intentional)
- Archetype is load-bearing (correct)
- Example: FTL could be ocean voyage, fantasy journey, anything—mechanics unchanged

**If YES but would lose something:**

- Setting reinforces but isn't necessary
- Example: Disco Elysium could be fantasy detective, but noir setting enhances
- Good balance—setting adds value without being load-bearing

**If NO, would break entirely:**

- Setting is load-bearing (be careful)
- Example: Papers, Please requires specific historical setting for theme
- This can work but limits flexibility

**Target state: Setting reinforces archetype without being structurally necessary.** This gives you flexibility while amplifying intended aesthetic.

## The Space Coffee Test: Does Your Setting Matter?

Now validate whether your context actually affects gameplay or is just cosmetic decoration.

### The Five Integration Levels

**Level 1: Pure Cosmetic** **What it means:** Setting has zero mechanical impact. Could swap for anything.

**Examples:**

- Chess piece designs (medieval knights vs. space marines—identical gameplay)
- Poker card art styles (western vs. fantasy—same rules)
- Tetris texture packs (blocks look different—mechanics unchanged)

**When this works:** Abstract games where theme is explicitly optional. Players understand it's cosmetic. No pretense of integration.

**When this fails:** Marketing promises "rich world" but delivers pure cosmetic dressing. Players expect setting to matter but it doesn't.

**Level 2: Mechanical Flavor** **What it means:** Setting provides variety within same mechanical category. Flavor distinctions without structural difference.

**Examples:**

- Borderlands weapons (fire/electric/corrosive damage—different flavor, same shooting mechanics)
- Fighting game character movesets (different animations, similar frame data)
- Fantasy race abilities (D&D races—minor modifiers, fundamentally same classes)

**When this works:** When variety creates interesting tactical options without excessive complexity. Different enough to feel distinct, similar enough to be balanced.

**When this fails:** "Flavor" differences are meaningless (players ignore them) or create imbalance without adding depth.

**Level 3: Constrained Mechanics** **What it means:** Setting limits what's mechanically possible. Removes options, creates boundaries.

**Examples:**

- Historical wargames (weapons match historical era—can't use modern tech)
- Low-magic fantasy (magic is rare and weak—constrains power fantasy)
- Hard sci-fi (physics limits ftl travel—affects exploration mechanics)

**When this works:** Constraints create interesting problems. Limitation breeds creativity. Setting-appropriate solutions feel earned.

**When this fails:** Constraints are arbitrary (don't follow from setting logic) or purely restrictive (remove fun without adding challenge).

**Level 4: Generative Mechanics** **What it means:** Setting creates unique mechanics that couldn't exist elsewhere. Setting generates gameplay.

**Examples:**

- _Cultist Simulator_ occult horror generates paranoia mechanics (balancing Dread/Fascination specific to forbidden knowledge)
- _Papers, Please_ 1980s border crossing generates document verification gameplay (couldn't exist in fantasy or sci-fi)
- _Return of the Obra Dinn_ 1800s ship investigation generates identity deduction from setting-specific clues (uniforms, dialects, relationships)

**When this works:** Always—this is ideal integration. Setting isn't decoration, it's the source of mechanics.

**When this fails:** Rarely fails because these mechanics emerge from setting. If setting changes, mechanics break.

**Level 5: Inseparable** **What it means:** Remove setting, game ceases to function. Setting IS the system.

**Examples:**

- _Disco Elysium_ (your mind is fragmented detective investigating specific place—remove either and game breaks)
- _Outer Wilds_ (time loop solar system exploration—setting and mechanics are one thing)
- _Her Story_ (video database of police interviews—interface IS the setting)

**When this works:** Creates unforgettable, unique experiences. Cannot be imitated without copying setting.

**When this fails:** Almost never—reaching Level 5 requires deep integration that naturally works.

### Applying the Test

**For each major system in your game, ask:**

□ **Could this system work in completely different setting?**

- YES easily → Level 1-2 (cosmetic or flavor)
- YES with changes → Level 3 (constrained)
- NO, breaks entirely → Level 4-5 (generative or inseparable)

□ **Does setting create unique mechanics here?**

- NO → Level 1-2 (space coffee)
- SOME variations → Level 3 (constrained)
- YES, unique mechanics → Level 4-5 (good integration)

□ **Would removing setting break this system?**

- NO → Decoration (cosmetic)
- PARTIALLY → Some integration
- YES → Load-bearing (setting matters)

**Example: Mass Effect Andromeda Analysis**

Combat system: Could work in fantasy, western, anything → **Level 1** (pure cosmetic)

Resource gathering: Identical to any survival game → **Level 1** (space coffee)

Dialogue system: Works in any setting with NPCs → **Level 1** (cosmetic)

Alien species interactions: Different flavor, same reputation mechanics → **Level 2** (mechanical flavor)

**Result: Almost entirely Level 1-2. Setting is space coffee.**

**Example: Return of the Obra Dinn Analysis**

Identity deduction: Requires specific 1800s ship setting (uniforms, nationalities, roles) → **Level 4** (generative)

Time-of-death witnessing: Could work elsewhere but enhanced by specific setting → **Level 3-4** (constrained/generative)

Visual style: 1-bit graphics evoke period insurance sketches → **Level 4** (setting-derived aesthetic)

**Result: Level 4 integration. Setting generates unique mechanics.**

### Target Integration by Aesthetic

**Discovery aesthetic:** Target Level 4-5

- Mystery is the point—context must create unique discoverable content
- Investigation requires setting-specific clues
- Generic mysteries don't engage

**Narrative aesthetic:** Target Level 4-5

- Story inseparable from context
- Characters defined by world
- Choices meaningful only in specific setting

**Challenge aesthetic:** Level 2-3 acceptable

- Mechanics are the point
- Context can be minimal (chess, Into the Breach)
- Or deep (XCOM, Monster Hunter)—both work

**Mastery aesthetic:** Level 1-3 acceptable

- System optimization is the point
- Context often optional (fighting games, Go)
- Abstract sometimes better (removes noise)

**Tension aesthetic:** Level 3-5 preferred

- Threat must feel real
- Setting creates vulnerability
- Generic danger less effective than specific threats

**Submission aesthetic:** Level 1-2 often best

- Simplicity is the point
- Deep context adds unwanted complexity
- Cozy settings work but keep mechanics simple

**When Space Coffee Is Acceptable:**

**Abstract games:** Chess, Tetris, poker—players understand theme is optional

**Mechanics-first:** Portal, Baba Is You—mechanics carry experience, context enhances

**Honest theming:** "Star Wars Monopoly"—players know it's [game] + [theme]

**When Space Coffee Fails:**

**Promises rich world, delivers cosmetic:** Andromeda marketed deep exploration, delivered space coffee

**Expects context to carry experience:** Narrative game with generic setting

**Setting fights mechanics:** Serious story with joke mechanics (or vice versa)

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - The Space Coffee Test is a proven diagnostic tool validated across thousands of games for identifying when context integration is insufficient.

## Maintaining Perspective: Every Element Must Serve

Context isn't just setting and archetype—it's the **perspective** through which players interpret everything. Perspective determines how players emotionally respond to every element.

### What Is Perspective?

**Perspective is the emotional lens that frames all game elements.**

Consider Ridley Scott's _Alien_ (1979). The xenomorph appears fully on screen for perhaps two minutes of a two-hour film. This wasn't technical limitation—the alien suit existed. They chose restraint.

Now imagine different framing: Extended scenes of the alien struggling with ladders, confused by doors, knocking things over clumsily. From its perspective, a frightened animal trying to survive.

**Is this still horror?** No. It's comedy, or nature documentary, or tragedy about a misunderstood creature.

**Same alien. Same actions. Different perspective. Completely different experience.**

### Perspective by Aesthetic

**TENSION AESTHETIC: "Unknowable Threat"**

What maintains this:

- Threat is dangerous and unpredictable
- Humans vulnerable and powerless
- Unknown scarier than known
- Deaths serious and consequential
- Atmosphere of dread

What breaks this:

- Comedy or pratfalls (establishes comedy perspective)
- Sympathetic framing ("poor creature" makes it understandable)
- Complete explanation (reduces unknown to biology)
- Power fantasy (player too strong)
- Threat shown as weak or incompetent

**Example:** _Alien_ maintained horror by never showing alien perspective, avoiding comedy, keeping creature mysterious and lethal.

**DISCOVERY AESTHETIC: "Solvable Puzzle"**

What maintains this:

- Clues exist and are findable
- Investigation yields results
- Deduction possible and rewarded
- Solution fair and logical
- Red herrings discoverable as false

What breaks this:

- Random solutions (killer chosen by dice)
- Contradictory clues (internal inconsistency)
- Supernatural deus ex machina (can't investigate)
- No path forward (investigation stalls)
- Arbitrary revelations (not earned)

**Example:** _Return of the Obra Dinn_ maintained puzzle perspective through completely logical deduction—every identity solvable through evidence.

**SUBMISSION AESTHETIC: "Safe and Pleasant"**

What maintains this:

- No real threats or danger
- Progress guaranteed
- Mistakes forgivable
- Atmosphere warm and welcoming
- Relaxation possible

What breaks this:

- Sudden threats or danger
- Permanent consequences
- Time pressure or stress
- Dark themes or violence
- Harsh judgment

**Example:** _Book of Hours_ maintained tranquility through peaceful restoration, no threats, gentle discovery, forgiving systems.

**CHALLENGE AESTHETIC: "Fair and Conquerable"**

What maintains this:

- Rules clear and consistent
- Failure understandable (can see why)
- Success achievable through skill
- Patterns learnable
- Victory earned, not given

What breaks this:

- Random failure (unfair)
- Unclear rules (can't learn)
- Unwinnable scenarios (hopeless)
- Inconsistent difficulty (arbitrary)
- Victory without effort (unearned)

**Example:** _Dark Souls_ maintained challenge perspective through pattern learning, fair deaths, and skill-based victory—no random instant-kills.

### The Perspective Filter

**Every element must pass this test: "Does this serve my perspective?"**

- **YES** → Keep, proceed to detail decisions
- **NO** → Cut or reframe

This applies to EVERYTHING:

- Every scene and event
- Every NPC and creature
- Every dialogue line
- Every mechanical interaction
- Every lore fragment
- Every visual or audio element

**No exceptions. No matter how "realistic" or "interesting."**

### Worked Example: Horror Investigation Perspective

**Perspective:** "Players are prey facing unknowable threat"

**Means:**

- Threat dangerous, unpredictable, superior
- Players vulnerable and uncertain
- Unknown maintained (mystery = fear)
- Deaths serious (stakes real)
- No comedy, no sympathy for threat

**Testing elements:**

**Element: Alien creature**

- Serves unknowable threat? YES—it IS the threat
- **Decision: KEEP**, proceed to detail decisions

**Element: Detailed alien lifecycle explanation**

- Serves unknowable threat? NO—reduces to understandable biology
- Makes it "knowable" (breaks unknown)
- **Decision: CUT** or minimize heavily

**Element: Alien's perspective scene**

- Serves unknowable threat? NO—humanizes threat
- Creates sympathy (understand its view)
- Makes it relatable instead of alien
- **Decision: CUT ENTIRELY**

**Element: Alien struggling with door**

- Serves unknowable threat? **DEPENDS ON FRAMING**
- If framed as: "Learning, adapting" → YES (threat increases)
- If framed as: "Struggling, failing" → NO (comedy)
- **Decision: Include ONLY if framed as intelligence, cut if uncertain**

**Element: Comic relief character**

- Serves unknowable threat? NO—establishes comedy perspective
- Breaks horror tone completely
- Even "nervous humor" risks breaking perspective
- **Decision: CUT** or reframe as nervous coping (not comedy)

**Result:** Every kept element serves "unknowable threat" perspective. Everything else cut regardless of how "realistic" or "interesting."

**The iron rule: Perspective over realism.** Your game serves an aesthetic, not documentary accuracy.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Perspective maintenance is an observable pattern across successful games in each aesthetic category. Violations consistently damage intended experiences.

## Build/Suggest/Omit: Strategic Detail Management

Once you've chosen archetype, setting, and perspective, decide how much detail to provide for each element. Not everything needs complete explanation—strategic restraint often creates more engagement than exhaustive detail.

### The Three Approaches

**BUILD: Explicit and Complete** **What it means:** Fully specify this element. Leave no ambiguity.

**When to use:**

- Core mechanics players must understand
- Rules that must be clear for gameplay
- Essential setting details that constrain decisions
- Information needed for strategy

**Examples:**

- Combat rules (must be clear)
- Resource costs (players need exact numbers)
- Quest objectives (must know what to do)
- Character abilities (need to plan builds)

**SUGGEST: Hints and Fragments** **What it means:** Provide pieces, let players assemble. Imply without confirming.

**When to use:**

- Backstory and history (engagement through curiosity)
- Character motivations (more interesting incomplete)
- World cosmology (mystery serves better than explanation)
- Connections between events (players enjoy theorizing)

**Examples:**

- Environmental storytelling (visual clues)
- Fragmentary documents (partial information)
- NPC hints about past events (conflicting accounts)
- Suggestive lore (implications not confirmations)

**OMIT: Deliberately Absent** **What it means:** Refuse to explain. Leave mysterious or unknown.

**When to use:**

- Information that would break perspective (horror explanation)
- Details that don't serve gameplay (irrelevant trivia)
- Mysteries better left unsolved (engagement through wonder)
- Complexity that would overwhelm (cognitive load management)

**Examples:**

- Complete supernatural explanations (kills horror)
- Exhaustive world history (tedious and unused)
- Every character's life story (overwhelming detail)
- Mechanics player doesn't need to know (hidden complexity)

### Build/Suggest/Omit Ratios by Archetype

Different archetypes need different detail distributions:

**INVESTIGATION ARCHETYPE:**

- Build: HIGH (core mysteries solvable, clues explicit)
- Suggest: HIGH (connections between clues implied)
- Omit: MEDIUM (some mysteries background flavor)

Why: Investigation requires sufficient information to deduce but benefits from suggestive connections. Can't solve if everything omitted, won't engage if everything built explicitly.

**Example:** _Return of the Obra Dinn_

- Built: Every death explicitly shown, nationalities/roles identifiable
- Suggested: Relationships between crew, motives, backstories
- Omitted: Why supernatural elements exist, deeper world cosmology

**SURVIVAL HORROR ARCHETYPE:**

- Build: MEDIUM (rules clear enough to strategize)
- Suggest: HIGH (threat nature implied, not confirmed)
- Omit: HIGH (maintain unknowable threat)

Why: Players need tactical information (can I hide here? how many bullets?) but not threat explanation (ruins horror).

**Example:** _Alien: Isolation_

- Built: Station layout, save stations, crafting recipes
- Suggested: Alien behavior patterns, station history
- Omitted: Complete alien biology, deeper Weyland-Yutani plans

**COZY SIMULATION ARCHETYPE:**

- Build: HIGH (mechanics clear and comfortable)
- Suggest: LOW (don't want confusion or mystery)
- Omit: HIGH (complexity hidden, only show what's needed)

Why: Submission aesthetic needs clarity and comfort. Mystery creates uncertainty (wrong aesthetic).

**Example:** _Animal Crossing_

- Built: What each building does, how to catch fish, clear objectives
- Suggested: Minimal (neighbor personalities surface-level)
- Omitted: Complex systems (turnip market mechanics hidden), failure states

**TACTICAL COMBAT ARCHETYPE:**

- Build: VERY HIGH (rules must be completely clear)
- Suggest: LOW (ambiguity creates frustration)
- Omit: MEDIUM (hide unnecessary complexity)

Why: Challenge aesthetic requires understanding rules to overcome difficulty. Hidden mechanics feel unfair.

**Example:** _Into the Breach_

- Built: Exact damage numbers, enemy behavior previews, all relevant information
- Suggested: Minimal (some enemy variants discovered through play)
- Omitted: Background lore (available but not necessary)

**4X STRATEGY ARCHETYPE:**

- Build: HIGH (complex systems need explanation)
- Suggest: MEDIUM (some discovery through experimentation)
- Omit: LOW (Mastery aesthetic wants depth revealed)

Why: Mastery requires understanding systems deeply. Hidden mechanics create optimization puzzles but core rules must be clear.

**Example:** _Civilization VI_

- Built: Tech trees, building effects, unit stats, victory conditions
- Suggested: Optimal strategies (players discover through experience)
- Omitted: Very little (tooltips explain almost everything)

**[LLM-INTEGRATION-OPPORTUNITY: For games with massive worlds, LLM could assist Build/Suggest/Omit decisions at scale. Given archetype and aesthetic, analyze thousands of lore fragments and suggest which to build explicitly, which to suggest, which to omit. Would require human validation but could dramatically accelerate worldbuilding coherence for large teams.]**

### The Decision Process

**For each game element, ask:**

□ **Does player need this to succeed?**

- YES → Build explicitly
- NO → Consider Suggest or Omit

□ **Would complete explanation enhance experience?**

- YES → Build it
- NO → Suggest or Omit

□ **Would mystery serve better than explanation?**

- YES → Suggest or Omit
- NO → Build it

□ **Does this serve my perspective?**

- YES and needs clarity → Build
- YES and mystery works → Suggest
- NO → Omit entirely

□ **Does this add cognitive load?**

- YES and essential → Build (manage load elsewhere)
- YES and non-essential → Omit (reduce load)
- NO → Build if serves experience

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake: Building Everything**

- Problem: Over-explanation kills engagement
- Reality: Weather Factory games succeed through restraint
- Fix: Omit non-essential details, suggest instead of build

**Mistake: Omitting Necessary Information**

- Problem: Players can't form strategies without information
- Reality: Challenge/Mastery aesthetics need clarity
- Fix: Build core mechanics explicitly, suggest flavor only

**Mistake: Inconsistent Ratios Across Game**

- Problem: Some systems clear, others mysterious—no coherent approach
- Reality: Confuses players about what matters
- Fix: Establish ratios for archetype, apply consistently

**Mistake: Building Lore That Doesn't Affect Gameplay**

- Problem: Extensive codex entries players ignore
- Reality: If it doesn't matter mechanically, it's just space coffee
- Fix: Omit or suggest lore that doesn't create decisions

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Build/Suggest/Omit ratios are validated across many games but optimal distribution is context-dependent and requires playtesting for specific implementations.

## Medium Constraints and Opportunities

Different media enable different archetypes and constrain design choices. Understanding these constraints helps choose appropriate archetype and implementation approach.

### Video Games

**What they enable:**

- Automated adjudication (complex calculations acceptable)
- Real-time interactions (timing challenges possible)
- Persistent state (save progress, track thousands of variables)
- Visual presentation (setting matters more, spectacle possible)
- Scalability (micro to meta loops all feasible)

**What they constrain:**

- Authored content (finite, must design everything)
- Rigid rules (no GM flexibility, edge cases must be coded)
- Player input limited (only what interface allows)
- Updates difficult post-launch (depending on platform)

**Archetype implications:**

- Real-time action: Natural fit (automation handles fast calculations)
- Complex systems: Works well (automated tracking)
- Infinite variation: Requires procedural generation (authoring limits)

### TTRPGs

**What they enable:**

- GM flexibility (infinite adaptation to player actions)
- Social interaction primary (Fellowship natural fit)
- Narrative flexibility (can adjust story on the fly)
- Player creativity unrestricted (describe any action)
- Improvisation (handle unexpected edge cases)

**What they constrain:**

- Manual adjudication (complex math problematic)
- Session structure (limited continuous time)
- Preparation required (GM must know content)
- Group coordination (scheduling, attention management)

**Archetype implications:**

- Investigation: Excellent (GM adapts to player theories)
- Social interaction: Natural (live conversation)
- Complex optimization: Difficult (manual calculation burden)
- Real-time action: Impossible (humans can't process simultaneously)

### Board Games

**What they enable:**

- Physical components (tangible resources, spatial gameplay)
- Simultaneous play possible (hidden action selection)
- Social interaction face-to-face
- No setup beyond components (no installation, servers)

**What they constrain:**

- Setup/teardown time matters (complexity limit)
- Component count limits complexity (physical storage)
- Usually single-session (macro loop IS session)
- Rules must be learnable (no tutorial system)

**Archetype implications:**

- Tactical positioning: Excellent (physical board, tangible units)
- Economic engine: Works well (physical resources trackable)
- Persistent progression: Difficult (usually one-session)
- Real-time simultaneous: Possible but chaotic

### Mobile Games

**What they enable:**

- Touch interface (direct manipulation)
- Always accessible (play anywhere)
- Short sessions (interruption-friendly)
- Portrait orientation (one-handed play)

**What they constrain:**

- Small screen (UI complexity limited)
- Interrupted play (must save state frequently)
- Short attention (micro/meso loops only)
- Simple controls (no complex inputs)

**Archetype implications:**

- Idle/incremental: Perfect fit (passive progress)
- Match-3 puzzle: Natural (simple touch controls)
- Complex tactics: Difficult (UI/control limitations)
- Long sessions: Inappropriate (players expect quick sessions)

### Choosing Medium for Archetype

**Archetypes that work everywhere:**

- Investigation (adapts to any medium)
- Puzzle (scales to any complexity)
- Narrative branching (works in any medium with content)

**Archetypes that prefer specific media:**

- Real-time action → Video games (automation necessary)
- Social deduction → TTRPG or multiplayer (requires live interaction)
- Complex 4X → Video games or dedicated board games (tracking complexity)
- Cozy simulation → Video games or mobile (persistent state valuable)

**Medium → Archetype mismatches:**

- Real-time action in TTRPGs (humans too slow)
- Complex 4X on mobile (screen/attention constraints)
- Persistent meta-progression in single-session board game (no persistence)

**The decision: Choose medium that naturally supports your archetype, or choose archetype your medium can handle.**

## Integration: How Context Connects to Other Chapters

Context isn't isolated—it determines what you build in every other system.

### Context → Resources (Chapter 3)

**Archetype determines appropriate resources.**

**Investigation archetype needs:**

- Evidence trackers (clues found, theories formed)
- Light currencies (minor resource management)
- Minimal limiters (investigation, not survival)

**Tactical combat archetype needs:**

- Action points (turn economy)
- Positioning resources (spatial advantage)
- Health as buffer (attrition gameplay)

**Survival horror archetype needs:**

- Scarcity (ammunition, health, saves)
- Limiters (create pressure)
- No abundant currencies (would remove tension)

**Cozy simulation archetype needs:**

- Abundance (remove pressure)
- Collection trackers (completion goals)
- No threatening limiters (would create stress)

**Forward reference:** Chapter 3 provides resource function framework (Limiters, Currencies, Trackers, Meta-resources) and shows how to design resources appropriate for your archetype.

### Context → Cognitive Load (Chapter 4)

**Archetype determines complexity budget.**

**Investigation archetype:**

- High information tracking (clues, connections, theories)
- Medium decision complexity (which leads to follow)
- Low execution complexity (thinking, not reflexes)

**Tactical combat archetype:**

- Medium information tracking (unit stats, map state)
- High decision complexity (positioning, action economy)
- Medium execution complexity (depends on real-time vs. turn-based)

**4X strategy archetype:**

- Very high information tracking (multiple systems, large map)
- Very high decision complexity (interconnected choices)
- Low execution complexity (turn-based, no reflexes)

**Cozy simulation archetype:**

- Low information tracking (simple systems)
- Low decision complexity (no wrong choices)
- Low execution complexity (forgiving, no pressure)

**Forward reference:** Chapter 4 provides frameworks for managing tracking load, decision load, and execution load within your archetype's complexity budget.

### Context → Balance (Chapter 5)

**Archetype determines balance paradigm.**

**Investigation archetype → Framework balance:**

- Must provide solvable mysteries
- Clues must exist and be findable
- Deduction must be possible with available information

**Tactical combat archetype → Consistency balance:**

- All options must be viable
- No dominant strategies
- Player choices must matter

**Social games → Adaptive balance:**

- Losing players need catch-up
- Winning players need challenges
- Dynamic adjustment prevents runaway leaders

**Forward reference:** Chapter 5 provides three balance paradigms (Framework, Consistency, Adaptive) and shows how to choose and implement appropriate paradigm for your archetype.

### Context → Temporal Architecture (Chapter 6)

**Archetype determines loop architecture.**

**Roguelike archetype:**

- Clear run structure (meso loops)
- Permanent meta-progression between runs
- Compressed architecture (hardcore players)

**Investigation archetype:**

- Case structure (meso/macro loops)
- Investigation per case (meso)
- Campaign across cases (macro)

**Cozy simulation archetype:**

- Flexible pacing (player-driven)
- No required stopping points
- Comfortable architecture (casual players)

**4X strategy archetype:**

- Long sessions (macro loops extensive)
- Multiple loop scales (micro, meso, macro, meta)
- Expansive architecture (hardcore players)

**Forward reference:** Chapter 6 provides loop scale framework (micro, meso, macro, meta), investment trajectories, and stopping point design appropriate for your archetype and player capacity.

## Chapter Summary

### Core Principles

**Context transforms mechanics into meaning.** The same mechanical systems create completely different experiences depending on contextual framing. Weather Factory's identical card mechanics become paranoid horror in _Cultist Simulator_ and tranquil meditation in _Book of Hours_.

**Context has four independent dimensions:** Aesthetic (experiential goal), Archetype (structural pattern), Setting (thematic layer), Medium (platform). These combine freely—same archetype + aesthetic with different settings creates similar games with different flavor.

**Archetype is load-bearing, setting is often cosmetic.** Archetype determines what mechanics you need. Setting provides thematic presentation. You can often reskin setting without changing core experience.

**Design flow: Aesthetic → Archetype → Setting → Resources.** Choose aesthetic (Chapter 1), select archetype that serves it (Chapter 2), choose setting that reinforces (Chapter 2), design resources appropriate for archetype (Chapter 3).

**Perspective over realism.** Every element must serve your intended perspective. Horror can't include comedy pratfalls even if "realistic." Mystery must have solvable puzzles even if real investigations are messy. Serve aesthetic, not documentary accuracy.

**Strategic detail management.** Build what players need explicitly. Suggest what engages through mystery. Omit what doesn't serve experience. Different archetypes need different ratios—Investigation suggests more, Tactical builds more, Horror omits more.

**Medium constrains archetype.** Video games enable real-time action and complex automation. TTRPGs enable infinite flexibility and social interaction. Board games enable tangible spatial gameplay. Mobile requires short sessions and simple interfaces. Choose archetype your medium supports or medium that enables your archetype.

**Context determines everything downstream.** Your archetype choice determines appropriate resources (Chapter 3), complexity budget (Chapter 4), balance paradigm (Chapter 5), and loop architecture (Chapter 6). Context is foundational—get it right or everything else struggles.

### The Context Design Process

1. **Choose primary aesthetic** (Chapter 1) - What experience do you want?
    
2. **Identify compatible archetypes** (use aesthetic-archetype matrix) - Which structural patterns serve this aesthetic?
    
3. **Evaluate archetype candidates:**
    
    - Does it naturally create primary aesthetic?
    - Does it support secondary aesthetics?
    - Can you build it with available resources?
    - Does it work in chosen medium?
4. **Choose one archetype** - This is now locked, determines mechanics
    
5. **Select setting that reinforces:**
    
    - Choose setting that amplifies aesthetic
    - Or use familiar setting for player recognition
    - Or create original setting for unique vision
    - Test with reskin test (should be able to reskin without breaking)
6. **Define perspective** - What emotional lens frames all elements?
    
7. **Apply perspective filter** - Every element must serve perspective (cut or reframe violations)
    
8. **Determine Build/Suggest/Omit ratios** - Match to archetype needs (Investigation suggests more, Tactical builds more, Horror omits more)
    
9. **Validate with Space Coffee Test** - Does setting actually matter or just cosmetic? (Target Level 3-4 for most games, Level 1-2 acceptable for mechanics-first)
    
10. **Proceed to Resources chapter** - Design resources appropriate for chosen archetype
    

### Integration Across Chapters

**Context provides to other chapters:**

- **Chapter 3 (Resources):** Archetype determines appropriate resource types and scarcity
- **Chapter 4 (Cognitive Load):** Archetype determines complexity budget
- **Chapter 5 (Balance):** Archetype determines balance paradigm
- **Chapter 6 (Temporal):** Archetype determines loop architecture

**Context receives from:**

- **Chapter 1:** Aesthetic framework and primary aesthetic choice

**Context is foundational.** It's Chapter 2 because every subsequent design decision depends on your archetype choice. Resources, cognitive load, balance, and temporal architecture all reference "what archetype are you building?"

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Starting with "cool setting" instead of aesthetic (space coffee risk)
- ❌ Confusing setting with archetype (Star Wars tells you flavor, not structure)
- ❌ Choosing archetype that doesn't serve aesthetic (incoherent experience)
- ❌ Breaking perspective for "realism" (horror can't have pratfalls)
- ❌ Building everything explicitly (over-explanation kills engagement)
- ❌ Omitting necessary information (players can't strategize blind)
- ❌ Ignoring medium constraints (choosing archetype medium can't support)
- ❌ Treating context as decoration instead of foundation (Andromeda failure)

### What's Next

Chapter 3 explores **Resource Management**—how to design the currencies, limiters, trackers, and meta-resources appropriate for your chosen archetype. Your archetype determines what resources you need: Investigation needs evidence trackers, Tactical combat needs action points, Survival horror needs scarcity, Cozy simulation needs abundance. Context provides the framework; Resources implements it.

The journey from aesthetic goals to playable systems requires first choosing context that serves those goals, then designing mechanics and resources within that contextual framework. Context isn't the final destination—it's the foundation that makes everything else possible.

**Confidence Level for Chapter Overall:** HIGH for four-dimension framework and archetype/setting distinction (synthesis validated), HIGH for Space Coffee Test and perspective maintenance (proven diagnostic tools), MEDIUM for specific aesthetic-archetype mappings (generally valid but context-dependent), MEDIUM for Build/Suggest/Omit ratios (validated but require archetype-specific calibration).
