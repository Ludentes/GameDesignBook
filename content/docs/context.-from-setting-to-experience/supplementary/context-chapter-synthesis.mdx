# Context Chapter Synthesis: From Analysis to Design Framework

## Overview

This document synthesizes insights from five game analyses into actionable design patterns for creating context that delivers intended aesthetic experiences.

**Games Analyzed:**

1. **Weather Factory Trilogy** - Same mechanics, different context = different experience
2. **Outer Wilds** - Discovery through restraint and interconnection
3. **Disco Elysium** - Context as primary system
4. **Return of the Obra Dinn** - What you hide creates the puzzle
5. **Mass Effect: Andromeda** - Failure of generic specificity

***

## Part 1: Core Insights Across All Games

### Insight 1: Context Is Not Cosmetic

**From every successful game:**

* Weather Factory: Same card mechanics, opposite feelings (horror vs. cozy)
* Outer Wilds: Handcrafted solar system enables specific discoveries
* Disco Elysium: Martinaise is inseparable from skill system
* Obra Dinn: 1807 ship provides perfect constraint set for puzzle

**From the failure:**

* Andromeda: Context is interchangeable (could be fantasy, historical, underwater)

**The Pattern:**
Context is load-bearing when it constrains what's possible, what makes sense, and what players can do. Test: "Could I reskin this?" If yes without changing anything → context is cosmetic.

**Design Principle:**
Context should be the reason mechanics work, not decoration applied after mechanics exist.

***

### Insight 2: Specificity Beats Quantity

**Successes:**

* Weather Factory: Few hundred cards, each with personality
* Outer Wilds: 60 discoveries, all interconnected and meaningful
* Disco Elysium: One district (Martinaise), deeply realized
* Obra Dinn: 60 crew, each solvable through specific clues

**Failure:**

* Andromeda: Hundreds of quests, dozens of locations, all forgettable

**The Pattern:**
Players remember specific, distinctive things. Generic content at scale creates "space coffee" - detailed but unmemorable.

**Design Principle:**
Build less context, but make it matter more. Every element should be distinctive and serve the aesthetic.

***

### Insight 3: What You Don't Build Matters

**Strategic absence across games:**

**Weather Factory:**

* Doesn't build: Character appearance, complete cosmology
* Why: Allows player projection, preserves mystery

**Outer Wilds:**

* Doesn't build: Nomai physical description, complete backstories
* Why: Focuses on mystery solving, not lore completionism

**Disco Elysium:**

* Doesn't build: Your past, world outside Martinaise
* Why: Concentrates detail where it matters

**Obra Dinn:**

* Doesn't build: Character personalities, life before death
* Why: Irrelevant to investigation task

**Andromeda (failure):**

* Built: Everything (planets, aliens, quests, lore)
* Result: Nothing stands out, all feels necessary but none feels essential

**The Pattern:**
Restraint creates focus. Building everything dilutes what matters.

**Design Principle (The Ridley Scott Principle):**
Show glimpses, not exhaustive detail. Suggestion creates wonder. Over-explanation kills mystery.

***

### Insight 4: Context Must Match Mechanics AND Aesthetic

**Successful alignment:**

**Cultist Simulator:**

* Aesthetic: Horror, paranoia
* Mechanics: Opacity, timer pressure, decay
* Context: Forbidden knowledge, isolation
* Result: Perfect coherence

**Book of Hours:**

* Aesthetic: Tranquility, cozy
* Mechanics: Transparency, gentle timers, forgiveness
* Context: Library restoration, helpful visitors
* Result: Perfect coherence (same core mechanics as Cultist!)

**Failed alignment:**

**Andromeda:**

* Aesthetic: Discovery, meaningful choice (intended)
* Mechanics: MMO gathering, cosmetic choices
* Context: Desperate colonization
* Result: Total incoherence (narrative says desperate, gameplay says abundant)

**The Pattern:**
Context, mechanics, and aesthetic must point same direction. Incoherence breaks immersion.

**Design Principle:**
Design aesthetic first, choose mechanics to serve it, build context that delivers it. Check coherence at every step.

***

### Insight 5: Context Enables Different Things in Different Genres

**Knowledge-based games (Outer Wilds, Obra Dinn):**

* Context provides clues and constraints
* Understanding context IS the progression
* Must be perfectly logical and consistent

**Narrative games (Disco Elysium, Weather Factory):**

* Context creates meaning for mechanics
* Atmosphere and tone are primary
* Can embrace ambiguity and mystery

**Action games (Andromeda failure):**

* Context must justify mechanical loop
* If mechanics don't need context, context fails
* Generic context enables generic gameplay

**The Pattern:**
Different aesthetics require different context approaches. Discovery needs interconnection. Narrative needs atmosphere. Action needs justification.

**Design Principle:**
Match context design to aesthetic goal, not to genre conventions.

***

## Part 2: Extractable Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Same Mechanics, Different Context (Weather Factory)

**When to use:**

* Building multiple games from one system
* Creating genre variations
* Serving different player energy states

**How to implement:**

1. Design elegant core mechanics (card + verb + timer)
2. Identify tunable parameters (scarcity, pressure, threat)
3. Create opposite aesthetic goals (horror vs. cozy)
4. Write context that reinforces each feeling
5. Tune parameters to match aesthetic

**Example:**

* Cultist Simulator: Scarce cards, pressure timers, decay → paranoia
* Book of Hours: Abundant cards, gentle timers, growth → tranquility

**Validation:**
Do the same mechanics create completely different feelings? If yes, pattern works.

**Warning:**
Requires strong writing to maintain distinct tones across similar mechanics.

***

### Pattern 2: Knowledge as Only Progression (Outer Wilds)

**When to use:**

* Discovery-focused games
* Mystery/investigation
* Intellectual engagement over mechanical mastery

**How to implement:**

1. Give all tools from start (no ability unlocks)
2. Make understanding unlock solutions (not keys or levels)
3. Create interconnected web of discoveries
4. Provide tool to track knowledge (ship log equivalent)
5. Test that any order of discovery leads to solution

**Example:**
Outer Wilds - every location accessible from start, understanding required to solve mystery, ship log tracks connections.

**Validation:**
Can player reach any location immediately? If no, remove gate. If yes, knowledge is progression.

**Warning:**
Frustrates players expecting mechanical progression (levels, stats, equipment).

***

### Pattern 3: Context as Primary System (Disco Elysium)

**When to use:**

* When setting is more important than mechanics
* Political/philosophical games
* Character-driven narratives
* Specific, detailed worlds

**How to implement:**

1. Design setting in extreme detail first
2. Derive mechanics from setting (not generic stats)
3. Ensure mechanics only work in this context
4. Make gameplay about engaging with setting
5. Test "space coffee" - could this work elsewhere?

**Example:**
Disco - Shivers only works in Revachol, skills reflect broken detective, politics are mechanical, Martinaise IS the game.

**Validation:**
Remove setting, can you still play? If yes, pattern failed. Context should be load-bearing.

**Warning:**
Requires exceptional writing and massive time investment. Not suitable for procedural generation.

***

### Pattern 4: Restraint in Explanation (Outer Wilds, Obra Dinn)

**When to use:**

* Mystery aesthetics
* Discovery-driven narratives
* Creating wonder and engagement

**How to implement:**

1. Show, don't tell (environmental storytelling)
2. Fragment information (pieces that assemble)
3. Trust player intelligence (they'll figure it out)
4. Provide discovery tools, not answers
5. Leave some mysteries permanent

**Example:**

* Outer Wilds: Quantum mechanics experienced, not explained
* Obra Dinn: Identities deduced, not stated

**Validation:**
Ask playtesters what they understood. If correct through inference → restraint worked.

**Warning:**
Can frustrate clarity-seeking players. Balance mystery with fairness.

***

### Pattern 5: Interconnected Discovery Web (Outer Wilds)

**When to use:**

* Non-linear exploration
* Complex mysteries
* Knowledge-based progression

**How to implement:**

1. Design 20-30 key discoveries
2. Map how each references others (literal web)
3. Ensure multiple paths to understanding
4. Create tool that visualizes connections
5. Test any discovery order works

**Example:**
Outer Wilds - Ash Twin Project requires understanding from multiple planets, any order works, ship log shows connections.

**Validation:**
Track player discovery paths. Wildly different but all reach conclusion → success.

**Warning:**
Requires extensive playtesting. Easy to create dead ends or impossible logic chains.

***

## Part 3: Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### Anti-Pattern 1: Generic Specificity (Andromeda)

**The mistake:**

* Lots of details (names, histories, descriptions)
* But none distinctive or memorable
* Quantity without quality

**Why it fails:**
Players don't remember details, they remember distinctiveness. 100 generic quests \< 10 memorable quests.

**How to avoid:**

1. Ask "What makes THIS specific and memorable?"
2. If answer is generic type (ice planet, emotional aliens) → rework
3. Build less, make it matter more
4. Test: Can player describe this afterward?

**Example:**
Andromeda's Angara - detailed backstory but "emotional humans with face paint." Not memorable.

***

### Anti-Pattern 2: Scale Without Purpose (Andromeda)

**The mistake:**

* Huge worlds
* Empty space between objectives
* Size as feature, not tool

**Why it fails:**
Big ≠ meaningful. Players remember density and purpose, not square kilometers.

**How to avoid:**

1. Ask "Why is this big?"
2. If answer is "immersion" or "realism" → question further
3. Size must serve experience
4. Prefer small and dense over large and empty

**Example:**
Disco's Martinaise (small district, deeply realized) > Andromeda's Voeld (massive ice planet, empty).

***

### Anti-Pattern 3: Aliens as "Humans With Face Paint" (Andromeda)

**The mistake:**

* Surface-level differences (appearance, stated traits)
* Human psychology, human thinking
* "Quirk" instead of different perspective

**Why it fails:**
True alienness is in thought patterns, not appearance. Andromeda's aliens think like humans.

**How to avoid:**

1. Design alien cognition (HOW they think)
2. Not just alien culture (WHAT they believe)
3. Create constraints on communication
4. Show alien logic through actions

**Example:**
Outer Wilds' Nomai - think like explorers/scientists, show it through ruins and writing, distinct from human perspective.

***

### Anti-Pattern 4: Promised Choice, Cosmetic Outcome (Andromeda)

**The mistake:**

* Tell players choices matter
* Make outcomes nearly identical
* Break trust

**Why it fails:**
Players detect false agency. Better honest linearity than fake branching.

**How to avoid:**

1. If can't branch meaningfully → don't promise branching
2. Small meaningful choices > large cosmetic ones
3. Show consequences visibly
4. Honest scope > broken promises

**Example:**
Andromeda's outpost choice (scientific vs. military) changes nothing meaningful. Disco's ideology choices shape entire experience.

***

### Anti-Pattern 5: Mechanics-First Context (Andromeda)

**The mistake:**

* Build systems (crafting, combat, exploration)
* Apply context as skin
* Hope it feels meaningful

**Why it fails:**
Context must constrain mechanics. If mechanics work anywhere, context is cosmetic.

**How to avoid:**

1. Start with aesthetic goal
2. Design context to deliver it
3. Choose mechanics that serve context
4. If mechanic would work in any setting → wrong mechanic

**Example:**
Andromeda's gathering/crafting works in any setting (fantasy, historical, underwater). Not specific to colonization.

***

## Part 4: Context Design Process

### Step 1: Define Aesthetic Goal

**Question:** What should players feel?

**Examples:**

* Cultist Simulator: Forbidden knowledge, paranoia, isolation
* Book of Hours: Tranquility, pleasant discovery, cozy productivity
* Outer Wilds: Wonder, intellectual satisfaction, cosmic awe
* Disco Elysium: Political engagement, fragmentation, melancholic beauty
* Obra Dinn: Deductive satisfaction, morbid fascination

**Output:** Clear statement of intended aesthetic(s) from our 12.

**Validation:** Can you pitch the feeling in one sentence? If not, clarify.

***

### Step 2: Design Specific Context

**Question:** What context delivers this aesthetic?

**Approach:**

1. **Identify constraints:** What makes this world specific?
2. **Build essential elements:** What must be detailed?
3. **Leave strategic gaps:** What should be mysterious/absent?
4. **Test distinctiveness:** Could this be in any other game?

**Examples:**

**For horror (Cultist):**

* Specific: Victorian occult, Hours mythology, isolation
* Essential: Forbidden knowledge systems, cult structure
* Gaps: Character appearance, complete cosmology
* Test: Could this be different setting? NO - requires occult context

**For cozy (Book of Hours):**

* Specific: Remote library, specific Hours lore
* Essential: Book collection, visitor stories
* Gaps: Why library fell, your past
* Test: Could this be different setting? NO - requires library context

**For discovery (Outer Wilds):**

* Specific: This exact solar system, Nomai mystery
* Essential: Planet layouts, clue interconnections
* Gaps: Nomai appearance, complete timeline
* Test: Could this be different setting? NO - requires these specific discoveries

**Output:** Detailed context design that serves aesthetic.

**Validation:** Does context constrain what's possible? If yes, specific enough.

***

### Step 3: Match Mechanics to Context

**Question:** What mechanics serve this context and aesthetic?

**Approach:**

1. **Context-first:** What actions make sense here?
2. **Aesthetic-first:** What mechanics create the feeling?
3. **Integration:** How do mechanics and context reinforce each other?
4. **Space coffee test:** Could mechanics work elsewhere?

**Examples:**

**Cultist Simulator:**

* Context: Forbidden knowledge
* Mechanics: Opacity (must decode), timer pressure (paranoia), card combinations (experimentation)
* Integration: Combining cards = performing rituals (thematic)
* Test: These mechanics need occult context (pass)

**Outer Wilds:**

* Context: Solar system mystery
* Mechanics: Zero-G flight, death loop, ship log
* Integration: Time loop enables non-linear discovery (thematic)
* Test: These mechanics need this specific mystery (pass)

**Andromeda (failure):**

* Context: New galaxy colonization
* Mechanics: Open world gathering, combat
* Integration: None - mechanics work in any setting (fail)
* Test: Could be fantasy/historical/underwater (FAIL)

**Output:** Mechanics that only work in this context.

**Validation:** Remove context - can you still play the same way? If yes, mechanics don't serve context.

***

### Step 4: Tune Parameters for Aesthetic

**Question:** How much, how fast, how scarce?

**Approach:**

1. **Identify tunable parameters:** What creates feeling?
2. **Tune for aesthetic:** Horror needs pressure, cozy needs abundance
3. **Test coherence:** Do all parameters point same direction?

**Examples:**

**Same mechanics, different parameters:**

| Parameter      | Cultist Simulator (Horror)   | Book of Hours (Cozy)    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Card scarcity  | High (must choose carefully) | Low (plenty to explore) |
| Timer pressure | High (decay constant)        | Low (generous time)     |
| Threat level   | High (death/madness)         | None (can't fail)       |
| Opacity        | High (must decode)           | Medium (clear but deep) |
| Recovery       | None (permanent loss)        | Fast (forgiving)        |

**Result:** Same mechanics, opposite feelings.

**Output:** Parameter settings that reinforce aesthetic.

**Validation:** Do parameters create intended feeling? Playtest and adjust.

***

### Step 5: Write Context to Deliver Tone

**Question:** How does language/presentation create feeling?

**Approach:**

1. **Voice consistency:** Every element sounds like it belongs
2. **Atmospheric writing:** Flavor text deepens immersion
3. **Show, don't tell:** Environmental storytelling
4. **Restraint:** What to leave unsaid

**Examples:**

**Weather Factory approach:**

* Every card has flavor text
* Writing maintains specific tone (occult/cozy)
* Cryptic but consistent
* Leaves mysteries permanent

**Disco Elysium approach:**

* Extensive dialogue (over 1 million words)
* Each skill has distinct voice
* Political theory taken seriously
* Maximalist text but purposeful

**Outer Wilds approach:**

* Minimal direct exposition
* Nomai writing personal but fragmentary
* Environmental clues primary
* Restraint creates wonder

**Output:** Writing guidelines and examples.

**Validation:** Does all text feel like it belongs in same world? If inconsistent, revise.

***

### Step 6: Test Context-Aesthetic Coherence

**Question:** Does the context create the intended experience?

**Testing checklist:**

□ **Aesthetic goal clear:** Can players articulate the feeling?\
□ **Context distinctive:** Is this specific and memorable?\
□ **Mechanics constrained:** Do they only work in this context?\
□ **Parameters tuned:** Do they reinforce aesthetic?\
□ **Tone consistent:** Does everything feel coherent?\
□ **Space coffee test:** Would reskinning break it?

**Validation methods:**

1. **Playtesting:** Do players feel what you intended?
2. **Comparison:** Is this as distinct as successful examples?
3. **Removal test:** Take away context - does it fall apart?

**Iteration:**

* If players feel wrong aesthetic → retune parameters or rewrite context
* If context feels generic → add specificity, remove quantity
* If mechanics fight context → change mechanics, not context
* If incoherent → check all elements point same direction

**Output:** Validated context that delivers aesthetic.

***

## Part 5: LLM Integration Considerations

### What LLMs Can Help With

**From successful games:**

**1. Expanding Specific Context (Weather Factory model)**

* Human designs core tone and mythology
* LLM generates additional card text maintaining voice
* Strict constraints prevent drift
* Validation: Does this sound like Cultist Simulator?

**2. Dynamic Responsive Context (Disco model)**

* Human designs 24 skill personalities
* LLM generates skill commentary on new situations
* Character voice constraints
* Validation: Does this sound like Volition/Inland Empire/etc?

**3. Procedural Fair Play (Obra Dinn model - HARD)**

* Human designs core mystery structure
* LLM generates flavor variations
* Logic validation layer critical
* Validation: Is this still solvable?

### What LLMs Cannot Do Well

**From failure cases:**

**1. Create Specificity from Generic Prompts**

* Andromeda's problem at scale
* "Generate sci-fi alien race" → generic
* "Generate ice planet" → forgettable
* LLM cannot invent distinctiveness

**2. Maintain Long-Term Coherence**

* Outer Wilds' interconnected web
* LLM bad at multi-step logical dependencies
* Cannot plan revelation pacing
* Breaks fair play mysteries

**3. Match Context to Aesthetic Without Human Design**

* Disco's context-as-primary-system
* LLM doesn't understand aesthetic goals
* Will default to generic
* Needs human vision first

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Process:**

1. **Human designs:**
   * Aesthetic goal
   * Core context (specific, distinctive)
   * Key patterns and constraints
   * Validation criteria

2. **LLM expands:**
   * Within strict constraints
   * Maintaining established tone
   * Following human-designed patterns
   * Subject to human validation

3. **Human validates:**
   * Does this maintain distinctiveness?
   * Does this serve aesthetic?
   * Is this coherent with core?
   * Would player notice difference?

**Example:**

* Human: Design Angara culture (specific values, communication style, philosophy)
* LLM: Generate Angaran dialogue maintaining these constraints
* Human: Validate it sounds Angaran, not generic

**Not:**

* LLM: Generate alien race
* Result: Generic "emotional aliens" (Andromeda problem)

***

## Part 6: Quick Reference for Designers

### Context Design Checklist

**Before building:**
□ Clear aesthetic goal defined\
□ Specific context designed (not generic)\
□ Mechanics serve context (not independent)\
□ Parameters tuned for aesthetic\
□ Strategic absences identified (what NOT to build)\
□ Writing guidelines established

**During building:**
□ Every element serves aesthetic\
□ Tone remains consistent\
□ Distinctiveness maintained\
□ Restraint practiced (resist over-building)\
□ Coherence checked regularly

**Validation:**
□ Space coffee test passed (can't reskin)\
□ Players feel intended aesthetic\
□ Context is memorable and specific\
□ Mechanics need this context\
□ No generic elements remain

### Red Flags

**Warning signs context is failing:**

⚠️ **Generic language in design docs** ("ice planet," "emotional aliens")\
⚠️ **Mechanics would work in any setting** (space coffee)\
⚠️ **Quantity over quality** (building everything exhaustively)\
⚠️ **Players can't describe it after playing** (not distinctive)\
⚠️ **Context feels like skin on mechanics** (not load-bearing)\
⚠️ **Tone inconsistency** (different elements point different directions)\
⚠️ **Over-explanation** (lost mystery and wonder)\
⚠️ **Players feel wrong aesthetic** (discovered through playtest)

### Emergency Fixes

**If context is generic:**

1. Add specificity (what makes THIS unique?)
2. Remove quantity (build less, better)
3. Find distinctive angle (Ridley Scott principle)

**If context doesn't serve aesthetic:**

1. Check aesthetic goal clarity
2. Retune parameters
3. Rewrite for tone
4. May need mechanic changes

**If context is incoherent:**

1. Identify contradictions
2. Choose one direction
3. Align all elements
4. Cut contradictory parts

***

## Part 7: Scenario Applications

### Scenario 1: Busy Adults Monthly Campaign

**Context needs:**

* Episodic structure (Book of Hours model)
* Quick re-engagement (Obra Dinn's sketch book for continuity)
* Low cognitive overhead (Weather Factory's simple mechanics)

**Pattern to use:**

* Same mechanics, different context (reuse core, vary scenarios)
* External memory aid (persistent record of campaign state)
* Gentle pacing (Book of Hours parameters)

***

### Scenario 2: Alien Cognition

**Context needs:**

* Truly alien perspective (not "humans with quirks")
* Restraint in explanation (experience, don't lecture)
* Internal logic (Outer Wilds' consistency)

**Pattern to use:**

* Context as primary system (alien thought becomes mechanics)
* Skills as personalities (Disco model for alien perspectives)
* Observation-based discovery (Obra Dinn deduction of alien logic)

**Anti-pattern to avoid:**

* Angara problem (surface differences, human thinking)

***

### Scenario 3: Mystery Investigation

**Context needs:**

* Fair play clues (Obra Dinn model)
* Interconnected discovery (Outer Wilds web)
* External investigation tool (ship log equivalent)

**Pattern to use:**

* What you hide creates puzzle
* Knowledge as progression
* Restraint in explanation

***

### Scenario 4: Subtle Powers

**Context needs:**

* Powers as natural laws (not flashy magic)
* Understated presentation (Book of Hours tone)
* Integration with context (Disco's Shivers - place-specific power)

**Pattern to use:**

* Context-as-primary-system (powers derive from setting)
* Matter-of-fact treatment (Disco model)
* Atmospheric rather than spectacular (Weather Factory)

***

### Scenario 5: Solo Play

**Context needs:**

* Perfect internal logic (Obra Dinn fairness)
* No GM improvisation (Outer Wilds consistency)
* Clear within-world rules (no LLM hallucination)

**Pattern to use:**

* Knowledge as progression (self-contained)
* Interconnected discovery web (internally complete)
* Confirmation batches (validate deductions)

***

### Scenario 6: Designer Ethics

**Context needs:**

* Serious research (Disco's political depth)
* Respectful treatment (not shallow stereotypes)
* Honest scope (don't promise Andromeda-scale)

**Anti-pattern to avoid:**

* Generic specificity (Andromeda's alien cultures)
* Promised choice, cosmetic outcome (breaks trust)
* Surface-level treatment of serious topics

***

## Part 8: Tools for Each Design Phase

### Phase 1: Aesthetic Definition

**Tool:** Aesthetic Statement Template

```
Players should feel: [specific emotions/states]
Players should want to do: [player-driven goals]
Players should remember: [memorable moments]
This is NOT: [what we're avoiding]
Success looks like: [observable outcomes]
```

**Example (Cultist Simulator):**

* Feel: Paranoia, forbidden knowledge fascination
* Want to do: Decode systems, pursue dark paths
* Remember: First understanding, specific endings
* NOT: Power fantasy, safe exploration
* Success: Players say "one more attempt"

***

### Phase 2: Context Specificity

**Tool:** Distinctiveness Test

```
Generic version: [what everyone does]
Our specific angle: [what makes ours unique]
Three distinctive elements: [memorable specifics]
What we're NOT building: [strategic absence]
Could this be elsewhere: [space coffee test]
```

**Example (Outer Wilds):**

* Generic: Space exploration mystery
* Specific: 22-minute time loop, handcrafted solar system, knowledge-only progression
* Distinctive: Quantum mechanics, Nomai fragments, ship log
* NOT building: Other galaxies, combat, upgrades
* Elsewhere: NO - requires this exact mystery structure

***

### Phase 3: Context-Mechanic Alignment

**Tool:** Coherence Matrix

| Element    | Cultist Simulator       | Book of Hours            |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Aesthetic  | Horror, Discovery       | Submission, Discovery    |
| Context    | Occult, isolation       | Library, tranquility     |
| Mechanics  | Card + verb + timer     | Card + verb + timer      |
| Parameters | Scarce, pressure, decay | Abundant, gentle, growth |
| Result     | Paranoia                | Peace                    |

**Check:** Do all elements point same direction? If not, identify contradiction and resolve.

***

### Phase 4: Restraint Planning

**Tool:** Build/Suggest/Omit Framework

**Build in detail:**

* What absolutely must be specific?
* What creates the core experience?
* Example: Weather Factory card text, Obra Dinn death scenes

**Suggest/imply:**

* What's more powerful mysterious?
* What enables player projection?
* Example: Outer Wilds Nomai appearance, your character's past

**Deliberately omit:**

* What would dilute focus?
* What's unnecessary for experience?
* Example: Disco's world outside Martinaise, Obra Dinn's character personalities

***

### Phase 5: Tone Validation

**Tool:** Voice Consistency Check

**Test elements:**
□ All text sounds like same world\
□ Visual style reinforces tone\
□ Audio matches atmosphere\
□ UI doesn't break immersion\
□ Every element reinforces aesthetic

**Method:**

1. Shuffle random samples (cards, descriptions, dialogue)
2. Can you tell they're from same game?
3. If no → tone inconsistency, revise

***

### Phase 6: LLM Integration (If Using)

**Tool:** Human/LLM Boundary Definition

**Human owns:**

* Aesthetic goal
* Core context design
* Key patterns and constraints
* Validation criteria
* Final approval

**LLM assists with:**

* Variations within constraints
* Expansion of established patterns
* Maintaining established voice
* Scale without losing quality

**Validation process:**

* LLM generates content
* Human validates: distinctive? coherent? on-tone?
* Iterate until passes
* Never ship without human validation

***

## Conclusion: The Core Lesson

**From Weather Factory:** Same mechanics, different context = different experience\
**From Outer Wilds:** Restraint and interconnection create discovery\
**From Disco Elysium:** Context can BE the system\
**From Obra Dinn:** What you hide creates the puzzle\
**From Andromeda:** Generic specificity fails regardless of budget

**The synthesis:**

Context is not decoration. It's not interchangeable. It's not "just setting."

**Context is:**

* The reason mechanics work (load-bearing)
* The delivery mechanism for aesthetics (how players feel)
* The constraint framework (what's possible)
* The source of distinctiveness (what's memorable)

**Good context:**

* Serves specific aesthetic
* Constrains mechanics meaningfully
* Is distinctive and memorable
* Uses restraint strategically
* Maintains coherence throughout

**Bad context:**

* Could be anywhere (space coffee)
* Detailed but generic (quantity without quality)
* Doesn't constrain mechanics (cosmetic skin)
* Over-built and exhaustible (no mystery left)
* Incoherent (elements contradict)

**The design process:**

1. Define aesthetic (what should players feel?)
2. Design specific context (what delivers that feeling?)
3. Choose mechanics that need this context
4. Tune parameters for aesthetic
5. Write with consistent tone
6. Test coherence relentlessly
7. Use restraint (build less, better)

**Purpose before mechanics. Specificity before quantity. Coherence above all.**

**Always.**
