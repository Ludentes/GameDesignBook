# Context Analysis: Mass Effect Andromeda

**Game:** Mass Effect Andromeda (2017)\
**Designer/Studio:** BioWare Montreal\
**Genre:** Action RPG, space exploration\
**Primary Aesthetics:** Discovery (intended), Narrative (intended), but delivers Submission/Collection\
**Analysis Focus:** Failure - generic context despite massive resources, "space coffee" at scale

***

## Part 1: The Intended Experience

**What SHOULD players have felt:**

* Wonder at exploring new galaxy (Andromeda Initiative premise)
* Connection to new alien races (Angara, Kett)
* Building a new home (outpost establishment)
* Sense of discovery and pioneer spirit
* Meaningful choices affecting colonization

**What players ACTUALLY felt:**

* Generic sci-fi checklist completion
* Familiar aliens (not truly alien)
* Busy work and fetch quests
* Empty open worlds
* Disconnection from stakes

**The promise:**
"Explore a new galaxy. Meet new races. Build a new home for humanity. Your choices matter."

**The reality:**
"Do MMO-style fetch quests across large but empty planets. Meet aliens who are humans with face paint. Place outposts that feel identical."

**This gap - between intended and delivered experience - is the failure.**

***

## Part 2: Context Design Choices (And Failures)

### What Context Was Built (Extensively)

**The premise:**

* Andromeda Initiative: Colony ships from Milky Way
* 600-year journey to new galaxy
* You're Pathfinder (scout, diplomat, scientist)
* Find "golden worlds" for colonization
* Contact with new species (Angara, Kett)

**The scale:**

* Multiple star systems
* Seven "golden worlds" to explore
* Dozens of side locations
* Hundreds of quests
* Extensive codex entries
* Voice acting, cutscenes, cinematics

**On paper, this is MASSIVE context investment.**

### What Context Was NOT Built (Despite Resources)

**What's generic/absent:**

**1. Alien Races Feel Human**

* Angara: Humans with forehead ridges (emotionally open humans)
* Kett: Humans who are militaristic (no truly alien thought)
* Remnant: Ancient precursor race (Prothean copy)
* No truly alien cognition (all think like humans)

**2. Planets Feel Samey**

* Different biomes (ice, desert, jungle)
* But same activities (scanning, collecting, fighting)
* Same outpost types (copy-paste structures)
* Same enemy bases (identical layouts)
* Massive, but empty

**3. Choices Feel Meaningless**

* "Choose outpost type" (scientific vs. military)
* But no significant consequence
* Companions like/dislike choices
* But relationships feel shallow
* Galaxy state barely changes

**4. Cultural Specificity Absent**

* No unique Angaran cultural practices (just "they're emotional")
* No Kett philosophy beyond "assimilation" (Borg lite)
* Your crew from different races but all think/act human
* Initiative culture is "generic professional"

**5. Stakes Never Felt**

* Premise: Humanity's survival
* Reality: Always feel safe, abundant resources
* No scarcity (despite failing colony)
* No desperation (despite dire situation)
* Disconnect between narrative (crisis) and gameplay (plenty)

### The "Space Coffee" Problem at Scale

**BioWare built:**

* Planets (big, detailed environments)
* Aliens (models, voice acting, backstories)
* Quests (hundreds of objectives)
* Systems (crafting, research, combat)
* Lore (codex entries, histories)

**But forgot to build:**

* **Specificity** (what makes THIS galaxy unique?)
* **Cultural depth** (what makes aliens truly alien?)
* **Meaningful context** (why do these activities matter?)
* **Coherent vision** (what experience are we creating?)

**Result:** Expensive generic sci-fi. Could reskin as fantasy, modern, historical - nothing would change fundamentally.

**This is "space coffee" at AAA budget scale.**

***

## Part 3: Context-Mechanic Relationship

### How Context SHOULD Constrain Mechanics

**Premise suggests:**

* Scouting unknown territory (exploration-focused)
* Building colony from scratch (resource scarcity)
* Diplomatic first contact (meaningful negotiation)
* Survival in hostile galaxy (danger, stakes)

**Mechanics should be:**

* Discovery-driven (finding new things matters)
* Resource-constrained (colony needs resources)
* Diplomatic (conversation has weight)
* Dangerous (failure has consequences)

### How Context ACTUALLY Constrains Mechanics

**What we got:**

* Open world busywork (collect 20 of X)
* Abundant resources (no scarcity)
* Combat-focused (shooting solves everything)
* Safe (can't fail, always win)

**The disconnect:**

* Premise: "We're desperate colonists"
* Reality: Unlimited ammo, infinite respawns, no food/water needs
* Premise: "First contact with aliens"
* Reality: Immediately shoot most of them
* Premise: "Your choices matter"
* Reality: Outcomes barely differ

### Mechanics Undermining Context

**Example 1: The Nomad (vehicle)**

* Context: Scouting dangerous unknown worlds
* Mechanic: Drive around collecting materials
* Problem: Feels like MMO gathering, not exploration
* Why it fails: Mechanical loop (drive, scan, collect) has no contextual weight

**Example 2: Outpost Building**

* Context: Establishing humanity's new home
* Mechanic: Choose outpost type (scientific/military)
* Problem: Cosmetic choice, no meaningful difference
* Why it fails: Game tells you it matters, but doesn't

**Example 3: Angara First Contact**

* Context: Meeting new species for first time
* Mechanic: Standard dialogue trees, companion approval
* Problem: Feels like every other BioWare game
* Why it fails: No unique systems for alien communication

### The "Space Coffee" Test

**Could you reskin this?**

* YES. Make it fantasy exploration - nothing changes
* YES. Make it historical expedition - same gameplay
* YES. Make it underwater base building - identical loop
* Context is cosmetic, not load-bearing

**What's interchangeable:**

* Planets → zones (MMO-style)
* Aliens → races (generic fantasy)
* Outposts → bases (RTS-lite)
* Pathfinder → chosen one (any RPG)
* Andromeda → any frontier

**Nothing about the gameplay requires this specific context.**

***

## Part 4: Context-Aesthetic Coherence Analysis

### Intended Aesthetics vs. Delivered

**Discovery (Intended):**

* Should feel: Wonder at new galaxy, meaningful exploration
* Actually feels: Checklist completion, busywork
* Why failed: Discoveries are generic (same minerals, same enemies)

**Narrative (Intended):**

* Should feel: Epic colonization story, meaningful choices
* Actually feels: Disconnected fetch quests, shallow relationships
* Why failed: Stakes never felt, choices cosmetic

**What Actually Delivered:**

**Submission:**

* Turn brain off and collect things (MMO-style)
* Follow objective markers
* Shoot enemies in between
* Not intended aesthetic, but what gameplay creates

**Collection:**

* Gather all minerals, all quests, all codex entries
* Completionist appeal (only thing that works)
* But no purpose to collection (doesn't enable anything)

### Coherence Problems

**Every element points different direction:**

**Narrative says:** Desperate colonization, survival stakes\
**Mechanics say:** Abundant resources, safe exploration\
**Result:** Dissonance

**Narrative says:** Meaningful choices affect galaxy\
**Mechanics say:** Choices are cosmetic\
**Result:** Players feel lied to

**Narrative says:** True aliens with different perspectives\
**Mechanics say:** Everyone thinks/acts human\
**Result:** "Humans with face paint"

**No coherence. Components contradict each other.**

***

## Part 5: Failure Analysis

### What Failed

**1. Generic Specificity Paradox**

BioWare built LOTS of specific details:

* Planet names, histories, geology
* Alien anatomy, culture notes, language snippets
* Character backstories, motivations
* Quest objectives, locations

**But none of it felt specific:**

* Ice planet feels like every ice planet
* Angara feel like any "emotional alien race"
* Quests feel like MMO filler
* Nothing memorable or unique

**Why:** Quantity over quality. Detailed but generic.

**2. Scale Without Purpose**

**Huge open worlds:**

* Voeld (ice planet): Massive
* Elaaden (desert planet): Massive
* Havarl (jungle planet): Massive

**But empty:**

* Copy-paste enemy bases
* Scattered collectibles (no narrative reason)
* Long driving with nothing interesting
* "Big" does not equal "meaningful"

**Why:** Size as feature, not as tool for experience.

**3. Alien Races Without Alienness**

**Angara:**

* Premise: Emotional, open, family-focused
* Reality: Humans who say "feelings" a lot
* No unique perspective, communication style, or values
* Just exposition dump about being different

**Kett:**

* Premise: Exaltation (genetic assimilation)
* Reality: Generic evil empire
* No philosophy, just "bad guys"
* Borg without interesting collective consciousness

**Why:** Aliens designed as plot devices, not cultures.

**4. Choice Without Consequence**

**You "choose" but nothing changes:**

* Scientific vs. military outpost (cosmetic)
* Exile vs. redeem (minimal impact)
* Romance options (standard BioWare)
* Galaxy state (barely different in ending)

**Why:** Systems built for choice, but no resources for meaningful branching.

**5. Context That Doesn't Constrain**

**The Pathfinder role should mean:**

* Limited resources (scouting frontier)
* Difficult choices (can't help everyone)
* Diplomatic expertise (avoid violence)
* Scientific discovery (finding new things)

**Actually means:**

* Unlimited resources (find everything easily)
* Help everyone (abundance of time/resources)
* Shoot aliens (combat is solution)
* Scan everything (data collection, not discovery)

**Why:** Mechanics from previous games applied without rethinking for context.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Development problems reported:**

* Short development time (18 months for AAA)
* Troubled production (engine change mid-development)
* Inexperienced team (BioWare Montreal, not main studio)
* Scope too large (couldn't finish everything)

**But these are symptoms. Core problem:**

**No clear vision for what experience to create.**

* Original Mass Effect trilogy: Clear vision (Shepard's hero journey, galaxy under threat)
* Andromeda: "Exploration and choice" (too vague)
* Built systems (open world, crafting, quests) without aesthetic purpose
* Generic sci-fi resulted from lack of specific vision

**This is mechanics-first design failure at massive scale.**

***

## Part 6: What SHOULD Have Been Different

### Alternative Approach 1: True Discovery

**Focus on Discovery aesthetic:**

* Smaller, denser worlds (quality over quantity)
* Truly alien environments (not just Earth biomes)
* Discovery has consequence (new tech, new understanding)
* Permanent changes from discoveries (galaxy evolves)

**Example:** What if finding Remnant tech actually changed how you colonize? Not just "+5% damage" but fundamentally different approaches.

### Alternative Approach 2: Colonization Focus

**Focus on Survival/Building:**

* Resource scarcity (must choose what to build)
* Colony management (XCOM-style decisions)
* Trade-offs (military vs. scientific vs. agricultural)
* Visible colony growth (see your choices matter)

**Example:** What if outpost choice meant you CAN'T have the other benefits? Military = safe but isolated. Scientific = discoveries but vulnerable.

### Alternative Approach 3: True First Contact

**Focus on Communication:**

* Learn Angaran language (not instant translation)
* Cultural misunderstandings (mechanics, not just story)
* Diplomatic solutions (avoid combat)
* Building trust takes time (not instant allies)

**Example:** What if you couldn't understand Angara initially? Had to learn through interaction? Makes first contact actually feel like first contact.

### What All Alternatives Need

**Specificity:**

* Andromeda should feel DIFFERENT from Milky Way
* Angara should think DIFFERENTLY from humans
* Kett should have PHILOSOPHY not just "evil"

**Coherence:**

* Mechanics serve aesthetic
* Context constrains mechanics
* Every system reinforces experience

**Restraint:**

* Smaller scope, deeper implementation
* Quality over quantity
* Don't build what doesn't serve purpose

***

## Part 7: LLM Implications (Cautionary)

### What LLMs Could Make WORSE

**Andromeda's problems would be amplified by LLM:**

**1. Generic Content at Scale**

* LLM generates "sci-fi planet description"
* Result: Even MORE generic worlds
* Andromeda already too generic; LLM makes it worse

**2. Shallow Alien Cultures**

* LLM creates "alien race"
* Result: Surface-level differences (Angara problem squared)
* No deep cultural coherence

**3. Meaningless Quests**

* LLM generates "side quest"
* Result: Infinite fetch quests (bad infinity)
* More busywork, not meaningful content

**Andromeda shows what happens when quantity > quality. LLM enables even more quantity without solving quality.**

### What LLMs Could Address (With Constraints)

**If used carefully:**

**Dynamic colonist stories:**

* Each colonist has LLM-generated personality
* React to your outpost choices
* Create emergent narratives
* BUT: Must maintain tone, not drift to generic

**Angaran cultural depth:**

* LLM generates culturally-consistent dialogue
* Maintains specific values/perspective
* Expands without contradicting
* BUT: Needs strong human-designed cultural framework first

**The key:** LLM can expand specific, well-designed context. Cannot create specificity from generic prompt.

### Lesson for LLM Design

**Don't do this:**
"Generate sci-fi planet with aliens and quests" → Generic slop

**Do this:**

1. Human designs core (Angara are \[specific cultural framework])
2. LLM generates within constraints (dialogue maintaining that framework)
3. Validate coherence (does this feel like Angara?)
4. Iterate (tune LLM output)

**Andromeda needed less content, more specificity. LLM without specificity = more Andromeda problems.**

***

## Part 8: Scenario Applications

### Scenario 1: Busy Adults

**Anti-lesson:** Don't create vast empty content

* Andromeda: Hundreds of hours, mostly busywork
* Better: Focused, meaningful sessions
* **Tool:** Quality over quantity

### Scenario 2: Alien Cognition

**Anti-lesson:** Don't make aliens "humans with face paint"

* Angara: Emotional humans
* Kett: Evil humans
* **Tool:** Design alien thought patterns, not human + quirk
* **Warning:** Surface differences ≠ true alienness

### Scenario 3: Mystery Investigation

**Anti-lesson:** Don't make discovery feel like checklist

* Andromeda: Scan everything (no purpose)
* Better: Discoveries have meaning
* **Tool:** Each clue reveals something, don't just collect data

### Scenario 6: Designer Ethics

**Anti-lesson:** Don't promise what you can't deliver

* "Your choices matter" but they don't
* "New galaxy" but feels same
* **Warning:** Broken promises damage trust
* **Tool:** Honest scope, deliver what you promise

***

## Part 9: Extractable Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Generic Specificity

**What NOT to do:**

* Lots of details (planet names, histories)
* But none memorable (all feel same)
* Quantity without quality

**How to avoid:**

1. Ask "What makes THIS specific?"
2. If answer is "it's a \[generic type]" → rework
3. Specificity beats quantity
4. Memorable > comprehensive

**Test:** Can player describe this after playing? If no, not specific enough.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Scale Without Purpose

**What NOT to do:**

* Build huge worlds
* Fill with copy-paste content
* Empty space between objectives

**How to avoid:**

1. Ask "Why is this big?"
2. If answer is "bigness is feature" → rework
3. Size must serve experience
4. Density beats scale

**Test:** Does travel time serve purpose? If just "realism" → too big.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Mechanics-First Context

**What NOT to do:**

* Build systems (crafting, combat, exploration)
* Paste context on top
* Hope it feels meaningful

**How to avoid:**

1. Start with aesthetic (what should players feel?)
2. Design context to deliver it
3. Choose mechanics that serve context
4. If mechanic fights context → change mechanic

**Test:** Does context constrain mechanics? If mechanics would work anywhere → failed.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Promised Choice, Cosmetic Outcome

**What NOT to do:**

* Tell players choices matter
* Make outcomes nearly identical
* Break trust

**How to avoid:**

1. If can't branch meaningfully → don't promise branching
2. Small meaningful choices > large cosmetic ones
3. Show consequences visibly
4. Honest scope > broken promises

**Test:** Do outcomes feel different? If just dialogue changes → not enough.

***

## Part 10: Quick Reference

**One-Sentence Lesson:**
Massive resources and detailed content cannot compensate for lack of specific vision - generic context remains generic regardless of budget, and quantity of generic content makes the problem worse, not better.

**Primary Anti-Pattern:**
Generic Specificity (lots of details, none memorable; alien races that are just humans with quirks; choices that don't matter; scale without purpose).

**How This Fails:**

* Discovery aesthetic promised but Submission delivered
* Narrative stakes undercut by mechanical abundance
* Aliens without alienness
* Choices without consequences
* Scale without density

**Warning for Designers:**
Do not build "exploration game" or "choice game" without specific vision of what players should discover or what choices should mean. Generic prompts produce generic content, regardless of budget.

**Quote (from disappointed player):**
"It's not a bad game, it's just... forgettable. I can't remember any character names, any planet names, any choices I made. It's all just... sci-fi stuff."

**Example of Failure:**
The Angara - marketed as new alien race to discover. Reality: Emotional humans with forehead ridges. No unique communication style, no truly alien perspective, no cultural depth. Just "we value family and feelings" explained in exposition. This is generic specificity: detailed backstory, zero distinctiveness. Compare to Outer Wilds' Nomai (actual alien culture) or Disco's political factions (human but specific) - both are memorable because they're specific, not generic.

**Lesson for Our Book:**
Andromeda is what happens when you skip aesthetic-first design. They built mechanics (open world, crafting, combat, choice systems) and pasted sci-fi context on top. Result: expensive space coffee. Our framework would catch this: "What aesthetic? What specific experience? How does context deliver it?" Andromeda couldn't answer.
