# Part 7: Dynamics - How Context Creates Behavior

## Introduction: The Missing Layer

You've designed your mechanics. You've chosen your context. But there's a layer between mechanics and experience that's easy to miss:

**Dynamics.**

Dynamics are the behaviors that emerge when players interact with mechanics within a context. Not what players CAN do (mechanics), but what they DO do (behavior).

**The MDA chain:**

* **Mechanics:** The rules (what's possible)
* **Dynamics:** The behavior (what actually happens in play)
* **Aesthetics:** The experience (what players feel)

Context doesn't just dress up mechanics. **Context determines which dynamics emerge.**

***

## The Weather Factory Proof

Weather Factory's two games prove this definitively:

### Same Mechanics

**Card + Verb + Timer system (identical in both games):**

* Draw cards from decks
* Place cards in verb slots
* Wait for timers to complete
* Receive outcome cards
* Repeat

**Mechanically, these games are the same.**

### Different Contexts

**Cultist Simulator (2018):**

* Setting: 1920s occult investigation
* Frame: Forbidden knowledge will corrupt you
* Tone: Dark, paranoid, isolated
* Stakes: Dread, madness, death constantly threaten
* Resources: Scarce, precious, dangerous to use

**Book of Hours (2023):**

* Setting: Countryside library restoration
* Frame: Knowledge is pleasant discovery
* Tone: Cozy, peaceful, safe
* Stakes: None (can't fail, can't die)
* Resources: Abundant, gentle, safe to explore

### Completely Different Dynamics

**Cultist Simulator player behavior:**

* Careful card selection (every choice risky)
* Paranoid checking (what will kill me?)
* Calculated risks (must balance survival vs progress)
* Conservative resource use (hoard safety margins)
* Constant tension (timers create pressure)
* Dread when drawing cards (what horrible thing now?)

**Book of Hours player behavior:**

* Exploratory card selection (no risk in trying)
* Relaxed experimentation (what's this do?)
* Free resource use (abundance enables play)
* Generous sharing with visitors (helping feels good)
* Pleasant anticipation (timers show progress)
* Delight when drawing cards (what lovely thing now?)

**The mechanics didn't create these behaviors. The context did.**

***

## Understanding Dynamics

### What Dynamics Are NOT

**Dynamics are not:**

* The rules themselves (that's mechanics)
* The specific numbers (that's parameters)
* The story or setting (that's context)
* What the designer tells players to do (that's instruction)

### What Dynamics ARE

**Dynamics are:**

* Emergent behaviors from mechanics + context interaction
* What players actually do when playing
* How players interpret and respond to situations
* The patterns of action that develop naturally
* The "gameplay that happens" between the rules

**Example - Drawing a card:**

**The mechanic:** "Draw one card from the deck and add it to your hand"

**The dynamic in Cultist Simulator:**

* Player hesitates before drawing
* Checks current game state for threats
* Considers if they can handle something bad
* Draws with trepidation
* Immediately checks if it's dangerous
* Makes contingency plans

**The dynamic in Book of Hours:**

* Player draws eagerly
* Curious what it will be
* Pleased by discovery
* Considers how to use it pleasantly
* Shares with visitors if appropriate
* Feels satisfaction

**Same mechanic. Opposite dynamics. Context created the difference.**

***

## How Context Shapes Dynamics

### Genre Expectations Create Behavior Patterns

**Mystery genre creates investigation dynamics:**

* Players ask questions of NPCs
* Players take notes and connect clues
* Players revisit locations with new information
* Players discuss theories with each other
* Players check evidence against alibis
* Players feel satisfaction from deduction

**These behaviors aren't in the rules. The genre expectation creates them.**

**Horror genre creates survival dynamics:**

* Players proceed cautiously through spaces
* Players check corners before entering rooms
* Players conserve resources "just in case"
* Players create safe zones and retreat paths
* Players react with tension to unexpected sounds
* Players avoid confrontation when possible

**Again, not explicitly commanded. The horror context naturally creates this behavior.**

**Heist genre creates planning dynamics:**

* Players spend time in pre-mission planning
* Players assign roles and responsibilities
* Players create backup plans
* Players use flashback mechanics extensively
* Players coordinate timing and positioning
* Players feel clever when plans work

**The genre sets expectations that shape how players engage.**

### Framing Changes Interpretation

**Consider a creature that attacks players:**

**Framed as unknowable horror:**

* Players: "What IS that thing?"
* Behavior: Cautious, fearful, avoiding
* Dynamic: Survival and evasion
* Feeling: Tension

**Framed as natural predator:**

* Players: "It's just hunting, following instinct"
* Behavior: Strategic, analytical, studying patterns
* Dynamic: Learning and countering
* Feeling: Challenge

**Framed as tragic victim:**

* Players: "Poor creature, it's suffering"
* Behavior: Seeking to help or mercy kill
* Dynamic: Compassion and resolution
* Feeling: Sympathy

**Same creature. Same attacks. Different framing = different dynamics.**

This is why you cannot want horror and then show alien pratfalls. The framing breaks, the dynamics shift from fear to amusement, and the aesthetic fails.

***

## Genre-Specific Dynamics

Let's examine how different genres create predictable dynamics:

### Mystery Investigation Dynamics

**Genre structure creates:**

* Information gathering behavior (players seek clues)
* Theory formation (players connect evidence)
* Testing hypotheses (players check theories against facts)
* Deductive reasoning (players eliminate impossibilities)
* Satisfaction from correctness (players validate understanding)

**Example - Return of the Obra Dinn:**

* Players examine death scenes carefully
* Players cross-reference clues across scenes
* Players use process of elimination
* Players feel achievement when identities confirmed
* **The game never says "be a detective" - the genre creates this behavior**

### Horror Survival Dynamics

**Genre structure creates:**

* Cautious movement (checking before advancing)
* Resource conservation (saving for emergencies)
* Safe space creation (finding/defending refuge)
* Threat avoidance (stealth over combat)
* Tension management (dealing with fear response)

**Example - Alien: Isolation:**

* Players peek around corners
* Players use motion tracker constantly
* Players hide in lockers when threatened
* Players avoid alien rather than fight
* **The game creates threat context, players naturally become cautious**

### Cozy Exploration Dynamics

**Genre structure creates:**

* Relaxed pacing (no rush to optimize)
* Experimental engagement (trying things for curiosity)
* Aesthetic appreciation (noticing beauty)
* Social interaction (helping NPCs feels good)
* Collection behavior (gathering pleasantly)

**Example - Animal Crossing:**

* Players wander without specific goals
* Players decorate for enjoyment not efficiency
* Players talk to villagers daily
* Players collect items casually
* **The game creates safe context, players naturally relax**

### Tactical Challenge Dynamics

**Genre structure creates:**

* Analytical planning (studying before acting)
* Optimization seeking (finding best approaches)
* Pattern learning (recognizing and countering)
* Risk calculation (weighing odds)
* Mastery satisfaction (getting better over time)

**Example - Into the Breach:**

* Players preview enemy moves carefully
* Players calculate optimal positioning
* Players seek perfect solutions (zero damage)
* Players replay for mastery
* **The game creates puzzle context, players naturally optimize**

***

## Context-Mechanic Interaction

### The Same Mechanic, Different Contexts

**Mechanic: "Spend resource to take action"**

**In horror context (Alien: Isolation flamethrower fuel):**

* Players hoard fuel obsessively
* Players reluctant to use it
* Players save it for "real emergencies"
* Dynamic: Conservative resource management
* Feeling: Scarcity anxiety

**In power fantasy context (action game ammunition):**

* Players use ammunition freely
* Players confident it will replenish
* Players enjoy spending resources
* Dynamic: Aggressive resource use
* Feeling: Abundant power

**In puzzle context (Into the Breach energy):**

* Players calculate exact usage
* Players optimize efficiency
* Players view as tactical resource
* Dynamic: Analytical resource management
* Feeling: Intellectual satisfaction

**Same spending mechanic. Context determines how players use it.**

### How Context Enables Mechanics

**Some mechanics only work within specific contexts:**

**Flashback mechanics (Blades in the Dark):**

* Context: Heist stories where "I planned for this" is genre trope
* Without context: Feels like cheating or retcon
* With context: Feels clever and genre-appropriate
* **The heist context makes the mechanic acceptable**

**Stress/Trauma separation (Blades in the Dark):**

* Context: Desperate criminals accumulating psychological damage
* Without context: Why two damage tracks? Seems complex
* With context: Tells story of veteran getting worn down
* **The criminal context makes dual tracks meaningful**

**Time loop (Outer Wilds):**

* Context: Cosmic mystery where knowledge persists
* Without context: Frustrating repetition
* With context: Enables fearless exploration
* **The mystery context makes reset acceptable**

**Shivers skill (Disco Elysium):**

* Context: Martinaise is a place with its own consciousness
* Without context: Why can you talk to a city?
* With context: Natural expression of place-as-character
* **The specific location context makes mechanic sensible**

## Validating Context-Driven Dynamics

### The Test: Do Behaviors Match Aesthetic?

**For each aesthetic, specific dynamics should emerge:**

**Discovery aesthetic needs:**

* Exploratory behavior (players investigate freely)
* Curious engagement (players seek understanding)
* Theory formation (players connect information)
* Satisfaction from revelation (players enjoy "aha!" moments)

**Check:** Are players exhibiting these behaviors?

* ✓ YES → Context is creating discovery dynamics
* ✗ NO → Context may be wrong or broken

**Horror aesthetic needs:**

* Cautious behavior (players proceed carefully)
* Tension responses (players react to threats)
* Conservation instincts (players hoard resources)
* Fear of unknown (players avoid confrontation)

**Check:** Are players exhibiting these behaviors?

* ✓ YES → Context is creating horror dynamics
* ✗ NO → Something is breaking the fear (comedy? power fantasy?)

**Cozy aesthetic needs:**

* Relaxed behavior (players take their time)
* Experimental engagement (players try things without fear)
* Aesthetic appreciation (players notice pleasant details)
* Comfortable pacing (players don't rush)

**Check:** Are players exhibiting these behaviors?

* ✓ YES → Context is creating cozy dynamics
* ✗ NO → Are there threat signals creating tension?

### Common Dynamic Failures

**Mystery + Combat Focus = Violence Dynamics:**

* Intent: Players solve mystery through investigation
* Context provided: D\&D combat mechanics + mystery story
* Dynamic that emerges: Players solve problems by killing suspects
* Result: Wrong aesthetic (Challenge not Discovery)
* **The combat context overwhelms the mystery context**

**Horror + Power Fantasy = Fearless Dynamics:**

* Intent: Players feel threatened and cautious
* Context provided: Scary monsters + overpowered player abilities
* Dynamic that emerges: Players massacre threats confidently
* Result: Wrong aesthetic (power, not fear)
* **The power context overwhelms the horror context**

**Cozy + High Stakes = Anxious Dynamics:**

* Intent: Players relax and enjoy
* Context provided: Pleasant setting + permanent consequences
* Dynamic that emerges: Players stressed about making mistakes
* Result: Wrong aesthetic (anxiety, not submission)
* **The stakes context overwhelms the cozy context**

**Discovery + Gated Progression = Grinding Dynamics:**

* Intent: Players explore and learn
* Context provided: Mysteries + level requirements to access
* Dynamic that emerges: Players grind levels instead of investigate
* Result: Wrong aesthetic (progression not discovery)
* **The gate context overwhelms the mystery context**

***

## Designing for Intended Dynamics

### Start with Target Behaviors

**Don't start with:** "What mechanics do I need?"
**Start with:** "What do I want players to do?"

**Example - Horror game:**

**Target dynamics:**

* Players should move cautiously
* Players should feel vulnerable
* Players should conserve resources
* Players should fear encounters
* Players should create safe zones

**Context decisions that create this:**

* Frame threat as powerful and unpredictable
* Make resources scarce and valuable
* Make encounters dangerous and costly
* Provide hiding spaces not combat advantages
* Show consequences of careless behavior

**Mechanics that support this:**

* Limited saves/checkpoints (death is costly)
* Scarce ammunition/supplies
* Stealth more viable than combat
* Threat detection systems (hear it coming)
* Safe rooms with limited supplies

**Result:** Context + mechanics create intended cautious dynamics

### Remove Contradictory Signals

**Every element must support the same dynamics:**

**Horror example - checking for contradictions:**

✓ **Supports cautious dynamics:**

* Scarce resources → conservation behavior
* Dangerous threats → avoidance behavior
* Limited saves → careful behavior
* Dark environment → checking behavior

✗ **Contradicts cautious dynamics:**

* Abundant ammunition → aggressive behavior
* Easy combat → confrontation behavior
* Frequent saves → careless behavior
* Comedy moments → relaxation (breaks tension)

**If you find contradictions, remove them or the dynamics won't emerge consistently.**

### Test by Observation

**During playtesting, watch for:**

**Discovery aesthetic - observe:**

* Do players investigate environment?
* Do players take notes or form theories?
* Do players revisit areas with new information?
* Do players discuss possibilities?
* ✓ If YES → Discovery dynamics emerging
* ✗ If NO → Context isn't creating investigation

**Horror aesthetic - observe:**

* Do players move cautiously?
* Do players check corners/peek around walls?
* Do players conserve resources?
* Do players avoid confrontation?
* ✓ If YES → Horror dynamics emerging
* ✗ If NO → Context isn't creating fear

**Cozy aesthetic - observe:**

* Do players relax visibly?
* Do players explore without worry?
* Do players experiment freely?
* Do players enjoy ambiance?
* ✓ If YES → Cozy dynamics emerging
* ✗ If NO → Context may have hidden threats

## Cross-System Dynamics

### When Multiple Systems Create Complex Dynamics

**Real games combine multiple systems, each with its own context.**

**Example - Blades in the Dark:**

**Score system (heist genre context):**

* Creates: Planning, flashbacks, clever solutions
* Dynamics: Players act like heist movie characters

**Stress system (desperation context):**

* Creates: Tough choices, devil's bargains
* Dynamics: Players make risky decisions

**Heat system (criminal underworld context):**

* Creates: Consequences, notoriety management
* Dynamics: Players balance aggression vs stealth

**Trauma system (psychological damage context):**

* Creates: Character arcs, retirement decisions
* Dynamics: Players tell stories of veterans wearing down

**Combined dynamics:**

* Players plan heists cleverly (score)
* While managing desperation (stress)
* While avoiding attention (heat)
* While watching characters deteriorate (trauma)
* **Result:** Complete criminal underworld experience

**Each system's context reinforces the others. No contradictions.**

### When Systems Conflict

**Bad example - hypothetical broken game:**

**System 1 - Mystery investigation (discovery context):**

* Should create: Careful investigation, note-taking, deduction
* Context says: "Be a detective, gather evidence"

**System 2 - Combat encounters (challenge context):**

* Creates: Kill enemies for XP and loot
* Context says: "Fight to get stronger"

**System 3 - Time pressure (tension context):**

* Creates: Rush through areas quickly
* Context says: "Hurry or you fail"

**Conflicting dynamics:**

* Mystery wants: Slow, careful investigation
* Combat wants: Fight everything for rewards
* Time wants: Rush through without exploring

**Result:** Players confused about what game wants

* Do I investigate thoroughly? (no time)
* Do I fight everything? (wastes time, but XP...)
* Do I rush to objective? (miss clues, fail mystery)

**These systems work against each other. The contexts contradict.**

## Integration with Other Chapters

### Dynamics Connect Everything

**Resources (Chapter 2) → Dynamics:**

* Scarce resources → Conservative dynamics
* Abundant resources → Aggressive dynamics
* Context determines which fits aesthetic

**Cognitive Load (Chapter 3) → Dynamics:**

* High load + time pressure → Tension dynamics
* Low load + safety → Submission dynamics
* Context determines appropriate load

**Balance (Chapter 4) → Dynamics:**

* Framework paradigm → Negotiation dynamics
* Consistency paradigm → Pattern learning dynamics
* Context determines which paradigm fits

**Mechanics → Context → Dynamics → Aesthetics:**

* Mechanics enable actions
* Context frames those actions
* Dynamics emerge from interaction
* Aesthetics result from dynamics

**This is the complete chain. Context is the crucial middle layer.**

***

## Common Questions

### "Can I have multiple contradictory dynamics?"

**Short answer:** No, not successfully.

**Why:** Players follow the clearest signals. If mystery context says "investigate carefully" but combat context says "kill everything for XP," combat usually wins (it's more immediately rewarding).

**Exception:** If you deliberately create subsystems with different dynamics that don't interact. Example: Borderlands has cosmetic procedural weapons (no intended dynamics) and load-bearing spell systems (discovery dynamics). They don't conflict because they serve different purposes.

### "What if players don't behave as expected?"

**Diagnose:**

1. Is your context actually creating the framing you think it is?
2. Are there contradictory signals you missed?
3. Did you playtest with the right players for this aesthetic?
4. Is the dynamic actually wrong, or just different from expectation?

**If context is clear and players still don't behave as intended:** Your aesthetic-context pairing may be wrong. Revisit genre choice.

### "How much can I control player behavior?"

**You can't force specific actions.** But you can make certain behaviors feel natural and others feel awkward.

**Horror context makes:**

* Cautious play feel smart
* Aggressive play feel risky
* Resource conservation feel wise

**But players can still choose to play aggressively.** They'll just face consequences that reinforce "this isn't what the game wants."

### "Do all players respond to context the same way?"

**No.** Different player types respond differently:

**Achievers** may optimize even in cozy games
**Explorers** may investigate even in horror games
**Socializers** may chat even in tense games
**Killers** may compete even in cooperative games

**But:** Most players will follow contextual cues most of the time. Design for the majority experience, not edge cases.

***

## Summary: Context Creates Behavior

**The chain:**

1. You design mechanics (what's possible)
2. You frame them with context (how to interpret)
3. Dynamics emerge (what players do)
4. Aesthetics result (what players feel)

**Context is not decoration. Context determines which dynamics emerge from your mechanics.**

**Weather Factory proves:** Same mechanics + different context = completely opposite player behavior

**The lesson:** Don't just design mechanics. Design the context that creates the behaviors you want. Then design mechanics that support those behaviors.

**Next step:** Ensure everything aligns (Part 8: Integration and Coherence)

How to verify that genre, perspective, mechanics, resources, balance, and cognitive load all point toward the same aesthetic without contradiction.
