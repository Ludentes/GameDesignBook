# Part 6: From Genre to Design Document

## Introduction: Bridging Decisions to Action

You've completed the decision tree. You have:

* ✅ Primary and secondary aesthetics identified
* ✅ Genre chosen (load-bearing structure)
* ✅ Dressing selected (cosmetic layer)
* ✅ Understanding of what perspective to maintain
* ✅ Build/Suggest/Omit principles understood

**Now what?**

You need to actually build the context. You need a concrete plan—a blueprint that tells you what to create, how much detail to include, and what to deliberately leave mysterious.

This part provides a structured process for creating your **Context Design Document**: the practical working document that guides all your context creation.

**Time investment:** 2-4 hours for initial document, ongoing reference and refinement

**Output:** A complete blueprint for your game's context, ready for content creation

***

## The Context Design Document: Overview

**Think of this as your context blueprint.** Just as architects create blueprints before building houses, you create this document before writing descriptions, designing NPCs, or crafting lore.

**The document has five sections:**

1. **Core World Rules** (30 minutes)
   * What's possible/impossible in this world
   * Physical, social, and gameplay constraints
   * The foundational logic players need to understand

2. **Perspective Maintenance Rules** (15 minutes)
   * The one-sentence perspective you're maintaining
   * What always maintains vs what always breaks it
   * Red flags to watch for

3. **Content Inventory** (1-2 hours)
   * Every major element (locations, NPCs, events, lore)
   * Build/Suggest/Omit decisions for each
   * Rationale explaining why these choices serve your aesthetic

4. **System Integration** (30 minutes)
   * How context connects to mechanics
   * What resources fit this context (Chapter 2)
   * What balance paradigm works (Chapter 4)
   * What cognitive load is appropriate (Chapter 3)

5. **Creation Checklist** (5 minutes)
   * Final validation before you start building
   * Ensures you're ready to create content

**Each section has a template.** Fill them out sequentially. By the end, you have a complete plan.

***

## Section 1: Core World Rules

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Purpose:** Establish the foundational logic of your world—what's possible, what's impossible, and what players need to know to play.

### The Template

```markdown
# Core World Rules

## Physical Rules
[What are the laws of physics/magic/technology?]
[What can characters do?]
[What are the hard limits?]

## Social Rules  
[What society/culture exists?]
[What are the power structures?]
[What social constraints affect gameplay?]

## Gameplay Rules
[What do players need to know to make decisions?]
[What affects their choices?]
[What are the stakes?]
```

### Why This Matters

Players need consistent rules to make meaningful decisions. If the world logic is arbitrary or unclear, their choices feel meaningless.

**Good world rules:**

* Consistent (don't contradict themselves)
* Communicated (players can discover them)
* Constrained (limits create interesting decisions)
* Serve aesthetic (reinforce the experience you want)

**Bad world rules:**

* Arbitrary ("because the GM said so")
* Hidden until violated ("you can't do that")
* Contradictory (change based on convenience)
* Generic (could apply to any world)

### Example 1: Victorian Mystery

```markdown
# Core World Rules

## Physical Rules
- No magic or supernatural elements (realistic investigation)
- Victorian technology level (gas lamps, telegraphs, no phones/cars)
- London geography: Thames river, fog, distinct neighborhoods by class
- Travel takes time (can't teleport across city)
- Physical evidence persists (bodies, objects, traces)

## Social Rules
- Rigid class system (servants, working class, middle class, aristocracy)
- Class affects access to locations and information
- Reputation matters (scandal has real consequences)
- Police exist but are incompetent/corrupt (players must solve cases)
- Gender restrictions (women have limited legal rights, restricted spaces)
- Social protocol matters (etiquette violations noticed)

## Gameplay Rules
- Evidence is physical and findable (not random)
- NPCs lie for realistic reasons (self-preservation, loyalty, fear)
- Time pressure exists (killer may strike again, evidence can be destroyed)
- Players can investigate any location they can access
- Social class affects difficulty of access (servant can't waltz into manor)
- Deduction is rewarded (connecting evidence yields progress)
```

**Rationale:** These rules create a mystery investigation game where class barriers, social protocol, and technological limitations create interesting constraints. Players must navigate Victorian society while solving crimes.

### Example 2: Sci-Fi Horror

```markdown
# Core World Rules

## Physical Rules
- Alien is physical creature (can be detected, avoided, delayed)
- Alien cannot be easily killed by available weapons
- Ship has limited resources (ammo, medical supplies, fuel)
- Sections of ship can be sealed/isolated
- Vacuum kills humans instantly (airlocks matter)
- Artificial gravity can fail in sections

## Social Rules
- Corporate hierarchy exists but breaks down under pressure
- Crew members have conflicting priorities (survival vs profit vs heroism)
- No external help (ship is isolated)
- Communications with company compromised or unreliable
- Existing relationships and tensions affect trust

## Gameplay Rules
- Alien presence is deadly (one hit = death or incapacitation)
- Players can run, hide, or delay but not easily kill
- Resources deplete and don't regenerate
- Ship sections provide temporary safety
- Death is permanent (or very costly to avoid)
- Players must work together to survive
- Alien learns from player tactics (adapts)
```

**Rationale:** These rules create survival horror where players are vulnerable, resources scarce, and the threat adapts. Corporate unreliability and crew tensions add social horror layer.

### Example 3: Cozy Library Restoration

```markdown
# Core World Rules

## Physical Rules
- No combat or violence (peaceful world)
- Magic exists but is gentle (candles light themselves, books organize)
- Library is large but finite (discoverable completely)
- Weather is pleasant (seasons change beautifully, no harsh extremes)
- Time passes but there are no deadlines
- Tools and materials are available (never blocked by lack of resources)

## Social Rules
- Visitors come with requests, not demands
- Everyone is basically kind (no villains)
- Helping people is always possible and rewarding
- Reputation grows through good work
- No political intrigue or conflict
- Previous librarian left mysteriously but not sinisterly

## Gameplay Rules
- No failure states (can't lose, die, or get locked out)
- Mistakes are reversible (nothing permanent)
- Progress is always forward (never set back)
- Visitors wait patiently (no time pressure)
- Discovery is rewarded with pleasant surprises
- All activities are productive (no wasted time)
```

**Rationale:** These rules create submission aesthetic—safe, pleasant, stress-free. Every element removes pressure and ensures comfort.

### Your Turn: Exercise 1

**Fill out this template for your game:**

```markdown
# Core World Rules: [Your Game]

## Physical Rules
- [What's possible physically?]
- [What are the limits?]
- [What technology/magic exists?]

## Social Rules
- [What society exists?]
- [What power structures?]
- [What social constraints?]

## Gameplay Rules
- [What do players need to know?]
- [What affects their decisions?]
- [What are the stakes?]
```

**Validation questions:**

* Are these rules consistent with each other?
* Do they serve my aesthetic goal?
* Can players discover these rules through play?
* Do they create interesting constraints (not just "anything goes")?

***

## Section 2: Perspective Maintenance Rules

**Time:** 15 minutes

**Purpose:** Define what maintains vs breaks your intended experience. This is your north star for all context decisions.

### The Template

```markdown
# Perspective Maintenance

## Perspective Statement
[One sentence: What overall feeling/framing am I creating?]

## Always Maintain
- [What must every element do?]
- [What perspective must be preserved?]
- [What feeling should players always have?]

## Never Show
- [What breaks this perspective?]
- [What contradicts the intended feeling?]
- [What undermines the aesthetic?]

## Red Flags
- [Observable signs you're breaking perspective]
- [Player behaviors that indicate problems]
- [What to watch for during playtesting]
```

### Why This Matters

Remember: You cannot want horror and then show alien doing comedy pratfalls. Every element must serve your perspective. This section makes that perspective explicit and identifies what breaks it.

### Example 1: Sci-Fi Horror

```markdown
# Perspective Maintenance

## Perspective Statement
"Humans are prey facing an unknowable, unstoppable threat in isolation."

## Always Maintain
- Threat is dangerous and unpredictable (players can't fully understand it)
- Humans are vulnerable and outmatched (no power fantasy)
- Unknown is scarier than known (mystery serves horror)
- Deaths are serious and consequential (stakes are real)
- Isolation creates paranoia (no cavalry coming)
- Resources are scarce (pressure builds)

## Never Show
- Alien perspective or motivations (don't humanize it)
- Alien as sympathetic or "just an animal" (no nature documentary framing)
- Comedy or slapstick (no pratfalls, no jokes about threat)
- Easy victories (players shouldn't feel powerful)
- Complete explanations (mystery must persist)
- Safety and abundance (undermines horror)

## Red Flags
- Players laughing at the alien
- Players feeling safe when they shouldn't
- Players bored by threat (overexposure)
- Players sympathizing with creature
- Combat feels like power fantasy
- Mystery explained too completely
```

### Example 2: Mystery Investigation

```markdown
# Perspective Maintenance

## Perspective Statement
"A solvable puzzle that rewards careful investigation and deduction."

## Always Maintain
- Mystery is solvable through available evidence (fair play)
- Clues exist and can be found (discovery is possible)
- Deduction is rewarded (connecting evidence yields progress)
- NPCs lie for realistic reasons (not arbitrary)
- Players feel like detectives (intellectual satisfaction)
- Solution feels earned (not handed to them)

## Never Show
- Random or arbitrary solutions (chosen by dice)
- Impossible-to-deduce answers (requires knowledge players can't have)
- Obvious guilt/innocence (no challenge)
- Contradictory evidence (breaks fair play)
- Supernatural deus ex machina (unless that's investigable too)
- Solutions that ignore player deduction (their work should matter)

## Red Flags
- Players guessing randomly (not deducing)
- Players saying "How were we supposed to know that?"
- Players ignoring clues (not engaging)
- Players frustrated by lack of progress (stuck with no path)
- Solution feels arbitrary or unfair
- Players can't explain their reasoning
```

### Example 3: Cozy Library Restoration

```markdown
# Perspective Maintenance

## Perspective Statement
"A safe, pleasant space where restoration and discovery bring gentle satisfaction."

## Always Maintain
- Everything is safe (no threats or danger)
- Progress is always forward (never set back)
- Discoveries are pleasant (no dark secrets)
- NPCs are kind (no villains or antagonists)
- Time is abundant (no pressure or deadlines)
- Mistakes are reversible (experimentation is safe)

## Never Show
- Threats or violence (breaks safety)
- Harsh consequences (creates stress)
- Time pressure (creates anxiety)
- Antagonistic NPCs (creates conflict)
- Scarcity or deprivation (creates worry)
- Permanent failure (undermines comfort)

## Red Flags
- Players feeling worried or anxious
- Players afraid to experiment
- Players stressed about mistakes
- Players rushing (feeling time pressure)
- Any moment of fear or tension
- Players talking about "messing up"
```

### Example 4: Cosmic Wonder

```markdown
# Perspective Maintenance

## Perspective Statement
"Ancient mysteries revealing tragic beauty on a cosmic scale."

## Always Maintain
- Scale is vast (cosmic, not personal)
- Mystery is beautiful and tragic (not horror)
- Discovery is bittersweet (knowledge of loss)
- Ancient civilization was hopeful but failed (relatable tragedy)
- Universe operates on beautiful logic (physics, not chaos)
- Players are archeologists of meaning (piecing together story)

## Never Show
- Cheap horror (jump scares, gore)
- Evil aliens (breaks tragic wonder)
- Mundane explanations (reduces to ordinary)
- Complete answers (some mysteries remain)
- Cynical framing (everything is pointless)
- Modern ugly reality (shatters beauty)

## Red Flags
- Players frightened instead of awed
- Players bored by discoveries
- Players treating as obstacle course (mechanical focus only)
- Mysteries feel arbitrary not profound
- Players unmoved by revelations
- Loss of sense of scale (becomes personal not cosmic)
```

### Your Turn: Exercise 2

**Fill out this template for your game:**

```markdown
# Perspective Maintenance: [Your Game]

## Perspective Statement
[One sentence capturing the overall feeling/framing]

## Always Maintain
- [What must every element preserve?]
- [What perspective is non-negotiable?]

## Never Show
- [What breaks this perspective?]
- [What contradicts your aesthetic?]

## Red Flags
- [How you'll know if you're breaking perspective]
- [Player behaviors that indicate problems]
```

**Validation questions:**

* Can you state your perspective in one clear sentence?
* Is it obvious what serves vs breaks this perspective?
* Would your team agree on what's in "Never Show"?
* Are your red flags observable/testable?

***

## Section 3: Content Inventory

**Time:** 1-2 hours (this is the big one)

**Purpose:** For every major element in your game, decide what to Build (explicit), Suggest (fragments), and Omit (mysterious/absent).

### The Process

**Step 1: List Major Elements**

Identify everything significant in your game:

* **Locations:** Where does the game take place?
* **NPCs/Creatures:** Who/what do players encounter?
* **Events:** What happens during play?
* **Lore/History:** What's the backstory?
* **Objects/Artifacts:** What significant items exist?

**Don't list everything.** Focus on the 5-15 most important elements.

**Step 2: For Each Element, Use This Template**

```markdown
## [Element Name]

### Build (Explicit Detail)
- [What must be fully specified?]
- [What do players need to know for gameplay?]
- [What creates mechanical decisions?]

### Suggest (Fragments and Hints)
- [What's hinted at?]
- [What enables imagination?]
- [What's discovered through investigation?]

### Omit (Deliberately Absent/Hidden)
- [What's deliberately mysterious?]
- [What would break perspective if shown?]
- [What's irrelevant to experience?]

### Rationale
[Why do these choices serve your aesthetic?]
```

### Example: Sci-Fi Horror - The Alien

```markdown
## The Alien

### Build (Explicit Detail)
- Attack patterns: Stalking, ambush from vents, instant kill on contact
- Where it can go: All areas eventually, uses vents, air ducts
- Detection methods: Motion tracker shows movement, sound cues (hissing, footsteps)
- Lethality: One hit kills or incapacitates (no HP attrition)
- Cannot be killed: Only escaped, delayed, or temporarily driven away
- Learning behavior: Adapts to player tactics (won't fall for same trick twice)
- Physical capabilities: Climbs walls, drops from ceiling, runs faster than humans

### Suggest (Fragments and Hints)
- Physical appearance: Glimpses only—tail whipping around corner, biomechanical texture, elongated head in shadows
- Size and strength: Through aftermath—bent metal, torn bodies, crushed equipment
- Intelligence: Through behavior—outsmarts traps, learns patrol routes, anticipates
- Origins: Corporate logs hint at bioweapon experiment, classified project
- Life cycle: Eggs found in certain areas (unhatched), implications of breeding

### Omit (Deliberately Absent/Hidden)
- Motivation: Never explained why it kills (no nature documentary "it's just hunting")
- Perspective: Never from alien POV (no scenes showing what it thinks/feels)
- Lifecycle details: Don't show breeding, feeding, or full reproduction cycle
- Weaknesses: No obvious "shoot here to win" vulnerability
- Full appearance: Keep mostly in shadows/glimpses until climax (if even then)
- Sympathetic framing: Never portray as victim or misunderstood creature

### Rationale
**Build**: Players need mechanical information to make survival decisions. Attack patterns, detection methods, and lethality are gameplay-critical.

**Suggest**: Physical appearance and intelligence are more frightening when partially revealed. Fragments let players imagine something more terrifying than full specification. Corporate conspiracy adds paranoia.

**Omit**: Horror requires unknowability. Explaining motivation reduces alien to "just an animal." Full appearance breaks mystery. Never showing weakness maintains "unstoppable threat" perspective.
```

### Example: Mystery Investigation - Primary Suspect

```markdown
## Lord Ashford (Primary Suspect)

### Build (Explicit Detail)
- Public persona: Wealthy aristocrat, well-connected, respected
- Known whereabouts: At club during murder (multiple witnesses confirm)
- Relationship to victim: Business partner, jointly owned shipping company
- Financial situation: Appears wealthy but recent business losses (discoverable)
- Personality: Arrogant, dismissive of lower classes, controlling
- Observable behavior: Nervous when questioned about business, defensive about alibi

### Suggest (Fragments and Hints)
- Motive: Financial records suggest embezzlement, victim might have discovered
- Hidden debts: Gambling problem hinted at in club records (not proven)
- Secret relationship: May have been romantically involved with victim's wife (rumors, circumstantial)
- Alibi weakness: Left club briefly (servants saw him leave, witnesses didn't)
- True character: Hints of ruthlessness beneath polite exterior

### Omit (Deliberately Absent/Hidden)
- Actual guilt/innocence: Not determined until players investigate
- Full financial records: Some hidden, require breaking into office or bribing accountant
- Complete alibi timeline: Gaps exist that investigation can exploit or confirm
- True relationship with victim's wife: Never fully confirmed, stays ambiguous
- Whether capable of murder: Players must deduce from evidence, not told

### Rationale
**Build**: Players need enough information to consider him a suspect. Public persona, known facts, and observable behavior are discoverable through basic investigation.

**Suggest**: Motive, debts, and relationship hints create investigation paths. Fragments make deduction necessary—players must connect dots.

**Omit**: Guilt/innocence must be deduced, not revealed. Full financial records would make too easy. Ambiguity about relationship and character keeps mystery alive.
```

### Example: Cozy Restoration - The Library's History

```markdown
## Hush House Library History

### Build (Explicit Detail)
- Previous librarian left mysteriously but peacefully (retired to countryside)
- Library has been here for 200 years (established 1723)
- Contains rare books on various subjects (cataloging is the work)
- Some sections are in disrepair (dusty, damaged books, broken furniture)
- Local scholars visit occasionally for research
- No dark secrets or curses (completely safe)
- Previous librarian left organizational system (discoverable)

### Suggest (Fragments and Hints)
- Why previous librarian left: Letters hint at wanting peaceful retirement, perhaps health
- Notable past visitors: Guest books show famous scholars visited
- Interesting acquisitions: How did small library get some rare books? (Pleasant mystery)
- Lost sections: Previous librarian's notes mention "forgotten wing" (exploration opportunity)
- Relationships with local community: Hints at library being beloved gathering place

### Omit (Deliberately Absent/Hidden)
- Complete catalog: Discovery is part of the joy
- Every book's provenance: Some can be mysterious (but not sinister)
- Full architectural history: Let some rooms be pleasant surprises
- Previous librarian's personal life: Gentle mystery, never important

### Rationale
**Build**: Players need to know the library is safe, old, and in need of restoration. No hidden dangers or dark pasts—this is explicit to maintain cozy aesthetic.

**Suggest**: Pleasant mysteries about acquisitions and past visitors give discovery opportunities without stakes. "How did this book get here?" is curiosity, not dread.

**Omit**: Complete knowledge would remove discovery aesthetic. But critically, nothing omitted is dangerous or dark—just unknown, not threatening.
```

### Genre-Specific Ratios

**Different genres need different Build/Suggest/Omit ratios:**

**Mystery Investigation:**

* Build: 40% (core clues, basic facts)
* Suggest: 50% (connections, motives, hidden details)
* Omit: 10% (solution, some red herrings initially)
* **Why**: Investigation IS the game—must have things to investigate

**Horror/Tension:**

* Build: 30% (survival mechanics, immediate threats)
* Suggest: 30% (nature of threat, presence)
* Omit: 40% (explanations, full revelation)
* **Why**: Unknown is scarier—maintain mystery

**Challenge:**

* Build: 70% (mechanics, patterns, rules)
* Suggest: 20% (advanced techniques)
* Omit: 10% (very little mechanically)
* **Why**: Fairness requires clarity

**Cozy/Submission:**

* Build: 60% (safe systems, clear goals)
* Suggest: 30% (pleasant mysteries)
* Omit: 10% (nothing threatening)
* **Why**: Clarity creates comfort

**Discovery/Wonder:**

* Build: 30% (basic physics, navigation)
* Suggest: 50% (lore, history, meaning)
* Omit: 20% (final mysteries, cosmic questions)
* **Why**: Discovery requires things to discover

### Your Turn: Exercise 3

**List your 5-10 major elements:**

1. \[Location/NPC/Event/Lore element]
2. \[Location/NPC/Event/Lore element]
3. etc.

**For each, fill out:**

```markdown
## [Element Name]

### Build (Explicit Detail)
- [What's fully specified?]

### Suggest (Fragments and Hints)
- [What's hinted at?]

### Omit (Deliberately Absent/Hidden)
- [What's mysterious?]

### Rationale
[Why these choices serve your aesthetic]
```

**Validation per element:**

* Does Build include gameplay-necessary information?
* Does Suggest create productive mystery (not frustration)?
* Does Omit preserve perspective (not just hide arbitrarily)?
* Does the ratio match your genre needs?

***

## Section 4: System Integration

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Purpose:** Connect your context to the mechanical systems from other chapters. Ensure coherence.

### The Template

```markdown
# System Integration

## Resources (from Chapter 2: Resource Management)
- What resources exist in this context?
- How does context explain/justify these resources?
- What resources would break context?

## Balance Paradigm (from Chapter 4: From Principles to Numbers)
- Which paradigm fits this context/genre?
- How does context support this paradigm?
- What paradigm would contradict context?

## Cognitive Load (from Chapter 3: Cognitive Load)
- What's the cognitive load budget for this aesthetic?
- How does context support or reduce load?
- What complexity fits this context?

## Core Mechanics
- What mechanics does context enable?
- What mechanics does context constrain/forbid?
- How do mechanics reinforce context?
```

### Example: Sci-Fi Horror Integration

```markdown
# System Integration: Sci-Fi Horror

## Resources (from Chapter 2)
**Resources that fit:**
- Health/Survival: Permanent or slow-recovering (creates stakes)
- Ammo: Consumable, scarce (creates pressure)
- Hiding spots: Temporary buffers (tactical resource)
- Tools/equipment: Limited, depletable (resource management)

**How context justifies:**
- Isolated ship = no resupply (scarcity makes sense)
- Corporate cheapness = minimal equipment (diegetic explanation)
- Alien damage = permanent injuries (context supports mechanics)

**Resources that would break context:**
- Fast HP regeneration (removes vulnerability)
- Infinite ammo (removes scarcity pressure)
- Easy crafting (removes desperation)
- Abundant safe spaces (removes threat)

## Balance Paradigm (from Chapter 4)
**Paradigm:** Consistency (with Adaptive threat)
- Alien behaviors are learnable patterns (consistency)
- But alien adapts to player tactics (adaptive threat level)
- Stakes are high and permanent (consistency in consequences)

**How context supports:**
- Horror requires pattern learning (survive by understanding)
- Alien as intelligent hunter (explains adaptation)
- Ship is consistent environment (learnable space)

**Would break context:**
- Framework paradigm (negotiated stakes would remove horror)
- Fully adaptive (no patterns = frustrating not frightening)

## Cognitive Load (from Chapter 3)
**Load budget:** Medium-High
- Enough complexity to create pressure and decisions
- Not so much that players can't think under stress
- Real-time pressure increases effective load

**How context supports:**
- Limited mechanics (survival actions, not complex systems)
- Clear feedback (motion tracker, sound cues)
- Learnable patterns (alien behavior is consistent)

**Would break context:**
- Too complex (spreadsheet management kills immersion)
- Too simple (no decisions = no engagement)

## Core Mechanics
**Enabled by context:**
- Hide/seek gameplay (ship has hiding spots)
- Sound-based detection (isolation makes sound important)
- Resource scarcity (limited supplies on ship)
- Permanent consequences (isolated, no help coming)

**Constrained by context:**
- No easy combat (alien is superior)
- No social deduction (small crew, limited complexity)
- No long-term building (survival is immediate)

**Reinforcement:**
- Every mechanic serves horror aesthetic
- Scarcity → pressure → tension
- Permanence → stakes → fear
```

### Example: Cozy Library Integration

```markdown
# System Integration: Cozy Library

## Resources (from Chapter 2)
**Resources that fit:**
- Time: Abundant, no pressure (serves submission)
- Books: Collection resource (completionist satisfaction)
- Visitor requests: Episodic goals (clear progress)
- Restoration materials: Always available (no scarcity stress)

**How context justifies:**
- Peaceful countryside = no urgency (diegetic time abundance)
- Well-funded library = materials available
- Kind visitors = patient, no pressure

**Resources that would break context:**
- Scarce/depleting materials (creates stress)
- Time limits (creates pressure)
- Permanent consequences (creates fear)
- Competitive resources (creates conflict)

## Balance Paradigm (from Chapter 4)
**Paradigm:** Submission-focused (minimal challenge)
- No failure states
- Gentle progression
- Optional optimization

**How context supports:**
- Peaceful setting = no threats (diegetic safety)
- Library work = inherently non-violent
- Helpful visitors = cooperative not competitive

**Would break context:**
- Consistency paradigm (pattern learning suggests threat)
- High-stakes framework (creates tension)

## Cognitive Load (from Chapter 3)
**Load budget:** Low
- Simple mechanics (organize, restore, help)
- Clear feedback (visible progress)
- No time pressure (think at own pace)
- Multitasking friendly (can listen to podcast)

**How context supports:**
- Calm environment = no stress
- Library work = methodical, not urgent
- Forgiving systems = mistakes OK

**Would break context:**
- High complexity (creates mental burden)
- Hidden systems (creates confusion/stress)
- Time pressure (creates anxiety)

## Core Mechanics
**Enabled by context:**
- Collection/cataloging (books to organize)
- Restoration (damaged sections to repair)
- Visitor help (episodic requests)
- Gentle exploration (discovering new sections)

**Constrained by context:**
- No combat (peaceful world)
- No resource competition (breaks cozy)
- No permanent failure (removes safety)
- No complex optimization (creates pressure)

**Reinforcement:**
- Every mechanic serves submission aesthetic
- Progress always forward → comfort
- No failure → safety
- Clear goals → satisfaction
```

### Your Turn: Exercise 4

**Fill out integration for your game:**

```markdown
# System Integration: [Your Game]

## Resources (from Chapter 2)
**Resources that fit:**
- [What resources exist in this context?]

**How context justifies:**
- [Why do these resources make sense here?]

**Resources that would break context:**
- [What resources would contradict your world?]

## Balance Paradigm (from Chapter 4)
**Paradigm:** [Framework/Consistency/Adaptive/Hybrid]
**How context supports:**
- [Why this paradigm fits this context]

**Would break context:**
- [What paradigms would contradict?]

## Cognitive Load (from Chapter 3)
**Load budget:** [High/Medium/Low]
**How context supports:**
- [How does context enable this load level?]

**Would break context:**
- [What load level would contradict aesthetic?]

## Core Mechanics
**Enabled by context:**
- [What mechanics make sense here?]

**Constrained by context:**
- [What mechanics are forbidden?]

**Reinforcement:**
- [How do mechanics and context support each other?]
```

**Validation questions:**

* Do resources make diegetic sense in this context?
* Does balance paradigm match genre expectations?
* Is cognitive load appropriate for aesthetic?
* Do mechanics and context reinforce or contradict?

***

### What to Do If Checklist Fails

**If you can't check something:**

**Can't define world rules clearly:**

* Return to Section 1
* Start with genre expectations (what do players expect?)
* Make rules explicit rather than implicit

**Can't state perspective in one sentence:**

* Return to Section 2
* Look at your aesthetic goal (from Chapter 1)
* Ask: "What overall feeling creates this aesthetic?"

**Build/Suggest/Omit decisions unclear:**

* Return to Section 3
* Start with one element, work through template
* Check genre-specific ratios
* Validate against perspective

**Integration doesn't work:**

* Return to Section 4
* Check if resources contradict context
* Verify balance paradigm fits genre
* Confirm cognitive load matches aesthetic

**Genre and dressing confused:**

* Return to Part 2 (decision tree)
* Clearly separate structure (genre) from flavor (dressing)
* Ask: "Could I swap dressing without changing core experience?"

**Team disagreement:**

* Review perspective statement together
* Use specific examples (alien pratfalls = breaks horror)
* Document agreed-upon red flags
* Get buy-in before proceeding

***

## Using Your Document

**During content creation:**

**When writing descriptions:**

* Check: Does this maintain perspective?
* Check: Is this Build, Suggest, or Omit level?
* Check: Does this fit world rules?

**When designing NPCs:**

* Check: Do they fit social rules?
* Check: Are their behaviors consistent with world?
* Check: Build/Suggest/Omit applied appropriately?

**When creating mechanics:**

* Check: Does context enable this mechanic?
* Check: Does this reinforce perspective?
* Check: Integration requirements met?

**When someone suggests "cool idea":**

* Check: Does this serve perspective?
* Check: Does this fit world rules?
* If NO to either → cut or modify

**During playtesting:**

* Watch for red flags (perspective breaks)
* Check if world rules are discoverable
* Validate Build/Suggest/Omit ratios working
* Confirm integration is coherent

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Skipping the document**
"We'll figure it out as we go"

* Result: Inconsistency, contradictions, wasted effort
* Fix: Spend 2-4 hours on document, save weeks of rework

**Mistake 2: Vague perspective statement**
"Make players feel engaged"

* Result: No clear guidance, perspective drifts
* Fix: Be specific - "unknowable threat" not "interesting monster"

**Mistake 3: No Build/Suggest/Omit rationale**
"Just seemed right"

* Result: Can't validate decisions, hard to stay consistent
* Fix: Write why each choice serves aesthetic

**Mistake 4: Ignoring integration**
"We'll connect systems later"

* Result: Context and mechanics contradict
* Fix: Plan integration during document phase

**Mistake 5: Too much detail too early**
"Let me fully detail every NPC"

* Result: Wasted effort on elements that don't matter
* Fix: Document decisions, create content only when needed

**Mistake 6: Team working from different assumptions**
"I thought we agreed the alien was sympathetic"

* Result: Contradictory content, perspective breaks
* Fix: Written document everyone reads and signs off

## Next Steps

**You now have a complete Context Design Document.**

**You're ready to:**

* Write specific content (descriptions, dialogue, clues)
* Create NPCs with consistent behaviors
* Design locations that serve perspective
* Build mechanics that reinforce context
* Integrate with resources, balance, and cognitive load
* Validate everything against your blueprint

**What comes next in this chapter:**

**Part 7: Dynamics - How Context Creates Behavior**

* How same mechanics + different context = different player actions
* Why Weather Factory's games feel completely different
* Validating that your context creates intended dynamics

**Part 8: Integration and Coherence**

* Ensuring everything points to same aesthetic
* Coherence checklists
* What to do when elements contradict

**Part 9: Validation and Iteration**

* Observable success criteria by aesthetic
* Playtesting for context effectiveness
* When to iterate vs rebuild
