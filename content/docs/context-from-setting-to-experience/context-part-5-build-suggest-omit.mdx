# Part 5: Build, Suggest, Omit - Strategic Detail

## The Pitch Black Principle

In the screenplay for *Pitch Black* (2000), writer-director David Twohy included this note:

> "Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits. Chimera of the night.
>
> The point is made so the reader appreciates that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters.
>
> For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and lack of the same."

This is strategic restraint in action.

**The creatures exist.** They're real, physical, dangerous. They kill people on screen. But we rarely see them fully. We glimpse them. We hear them. We feel their presence.

**Why?**

Because **showing less creates more engagement** than showing everything.

This principle applies directly to game context design.

***

## The Three Categories

Once you've established your perspective (Part 4), you need to decide how much detail to provide for each element.

**Build (Explicit Detail):**
Information presented clearly and completely. Players know this for certain.

**Suggest (Fragments and Hints):**
Partial information that implies more. Players piece together or imagine the rest.

**Omit (Deliberately Absent):**
Information you could provide but choose not to. Mystery serves better than answers.

**These are not just "amounts of content."** They're strategic choices about how players engage with your context.

***

## When to Build

### Mechanical Necessity

**Build when players need information to make meaningful decisions.**

**Examples:**

**Dark Souls - Enemy Attack Patterns (Build)**

* Players must see and learn patterns
* Pattern recognition = core Challenge mechanic
* Hiding attack patterns would be unfair
* **Decision: Build explicitly through repeated exposure**

**Obra Dinn - Death Scenes (Build)**

* Players must witness what happened
* Investigation requires evidence
* Mystery = interpreting evidence, not guessing at events
* **Decision: Build every death scene in detail**

**Blades in the Dark - Position and Effect (Build)**

* Players negotiate stakes before rolling
* Framework paradigm requires transparency
* Hidden stakes would break negotiation
* **Decision: Build explicitly through conversation**

### Multiplayer Coordination

**Build when players need shared understanding to coordinate.**

**Examples:**

**Left 4 Dead - Special Infected Behaviors (Build)**

* Team must coordinate responses
* Different infected require different tactics
* Everyone needs same information
* **Decision: Build through clear visual/audio cues**

**Among Us - Task Locations (Build)**

* Crew needs common reference points
* Alibis depend on shared geography
* Asymmetric knowledge breaks social deduction differently
* **Decision: Build map layout explicitly**

### Perspective Reinforcement

**Build when explicit detail strengthens your perspective.**

**Examples:**

**Disco Elysium - Martinaise District (Build)**

* Narrative aesthetic needs specific place
* Every location deepens understanding
* Detail creates immersion
* Poverty and decay aren't abstract—they're specific buildings, specific people
* **Decision: Build exhaustively (1 million+ words on one district)**

**Book of Hours - Library Contents (Build)**

* Cozy aesthetic needs tangible restoration
* Specific books create satisfaction
* Vague "library stuff" wouldn't satisfy
* Collection requires specific items to collect
* **Decision: Build detailed catalog of books**

### Clarity Over Mystery

**Build when confusion would obstruct rather than engage.**

**Examples:**

**Tutorial Information (Build)**

* Players need to know how to play
* Mystery about basic controls = frustration not engagement
* "Figure out how to save the game" is not fun discovery
* **Decision: Build all essential interface/control information**

**World Rules (Build)**

* What's possible/impossible in this world
* Magic system rules (if magic exists)
* Physics constraints (can I jump this gap?)
* Social constraints (will this NPC kill me if I insult them?)
* **Decision: Build enough that players can make informed choices**

***

## When to Suggest

### Discovery Aesthetic

**Suggest when investigation and connection-making is the experience.**

**Examples:**

**Outer Wilds - Nomai History (Suggest)**

* Fragments scattered across solar system
* Each piece hints at larger story
* Players synthesize understanding from fragments
* Complete story never explicitly told
* **Decision: Suggest through scattered artifacts, player assembles narrative**

**Return of the Obra Dinn - Character Identities (Suggest)**

* Clues scattered throughout death scenes
* Clothing, dialogue, relationships hint at identity
* Deduction is the core mechanic
* Telling players directly would remove the game
* **Decision: Suggest through contextual clues, player deduces**

### Imagination Enhancement

**Suggest when fragments enable better imagination than full specification.**

**Examples:**

**Outer Wilds - Nomai Appearance (Suggest)**

* Statues show three-eyed form
* Size and proportions visible
* Exact details deliberately vague
* Each player imagines specifics
* **Decision: Suggest general form through statues, omit precise details**

**Weather Factory - Cosmology (Suggest)**

* Hours are described through fragments
* Aspects and correspondences implied
* Relationships hinted at
* Complete system never explained
* Players build their own understanding
* **Decision: Suggest through card text, preserve mystery**

### Atmospheric Depth

**Suggest when hints create richer atmosphere than exposition.**

**Examples:**

**Disco Elysium - Your Past (Suggest)**

* Fragments emerge through investigation
* Skills reveal different aspects
* NPCs provide contradictory accounts
* Truth assembled by player
* Complete autobiography would be boring
* **Decision: Suggest through fragmented memories and unreliable narrators**

**Dark Souls - Lore (Suggest)**

* Item descriptions hint at history
* Environmental storytelling suggests events
* Connections implied not stated
* Community discussion is part of experience
* **Decision: Suggest through items and environment, players theorize**

### Optional Depth

**Suggest when engaged players can discover more, but casuals can proceed.**

**Examples:**

**Obra Dinn - Additional Connections (Suggest)**

* Core identities solvable with basic clues
* Additional details reward closer observation
* Optional dialogue and background suggest deeper relationships
* Can solve game without finding everything
* **Decision: Suggest deeper lore through optional details**

***

## When to Omit

### Mystery Preservation

**Omit when answers would kill engagement better than providing them.**

**Examples:**

**Outer Wilds - Quantum Phenomena Explanation (Omit)**

* Quantum Moon, Quantum Imaging, Quantum Objects exist
* How they work shown through experience
* WHY they work never fully explained
* Complete scientific explanation would reduce wonder
* **Decision: Omit ultimate explanation, preserve mystery**

**Weather Factory - The Hours' True Nature (Omit)**

* Hours exist, have aspects, demand worship
* What exactly they ARE never fully revealed
* Fragments hint, but holes remain
* Complete taxonomy would be less interesting than mystery
* **Decision: Omit final answers, maintain cosmic uncertainty**

### Perspective Maintenance

**Omit when showing would break the perspective you're maintaining.**

**Examples:**

**Alien - Creature's Motivation and Perspective (Omit)**

* Horror requires unknowable threat
* Understanding motivation humanizes
* Seeing from creature's POV creates sympathy
* "Just following instincts" reduces from unknowable to animal
* **Decision: Omit completely to maintain horror perspective**

**Mystery Game - Solution Before Discovery (Omit)**

* Solvable puzzle perspective requires earning answer
* Telling players solution removes investigation
* Even hints that point too directly remove satisfaction
* **Decision: Omit until player deduces, then confirm**

### Irrelevant Detail

**Omit when information doesn't serve your aesthetic or gameplay.**

**Examples:**

**Complete World History (Often Omit)**

* Unless history directly affects current gameplay
* 10,000 years of detailed lore may not matter
* Players care about NOW, not ancient backstory
* **Decision: Omit or heavily minimize unless directly relevant**

**Character Appearance Details (Often Omit)**

* Unless appearance affects gameplay or identity
* Exact height, eye color, hair style may not matter
* Players can imagine specifics
* **Decision: Omit trivial details, suggest general impression**

### Fear of the Unknown

**Omit when not knowing is scarier than knowing.**

**Examples:**

**Horror - Complete Threat Details (Omit)**

* Unknown is frightening
* Full explanation reduces fear
* Scientific breakdown makes threat understandable
* Understanding = less scary
* **Decision: Omit lifecycle, origin, motivation**

**Cosmic Horror - Ultimate Truth (Omit)**

* Some things humanity cannot/should not comprehend
* Lovecraftian principle: full knowledge = madness
* Partial glimpses more effective than complete revelation
* **Decision: Omit by design, incomprehensibility is the point**

***

## Genre Affects Ratios

Different aesthetics and genres need different Build/Suggest/Omit ratios.

### Mystery/Investigation: HIGH Suggest

**Why:** Investigation IS connecting suggested fragments

**Typical ratio:**

* Build: 30% (core facts, evidence, world rules)
* Suggest: 60% (clues, connections, interpretations)
* Omit: 10% (some permanent mysteries acceptable)

**Example: Return of the Obra Dinn**

* Build: Death scenes, ship layout, available information
* Suggest: Identities through clues (clothing, dialogue, relationships)
* Omit: Some ambiguous cases (game accepts multiple solutions)

**Why this works:** Suggest is the game. Too much Build removes investigation. Too much Omit creates frustration.

### Horror/Tension: HIGH Omit

**Why:** Fear of unknown drives horror

**Typical ratio:**

* Build: 40% (how to survive, immediate threats, world rules)
* Suggest: 30% (threat nature through glimpses and traces)
* Omit: 30% (motivations, origins, full explanations)

**Example: Alien**

* Build: Ship layout, survival needs, immediate danger
* Suggest: Creature appearance (glimpses), intelligence (behavior)
* Omit: Creature perspective, motivation, complete biology

**Why this works:** Omit maintains fear. Too much Build reduces threat to understandable. Too much Suggest becomes frustration if horror depends on action.

### Challenge/Mastery: HIGH Build

**Why:** Fairness requires clarity

**Typical ratio:**

* Build: 70% (mechanics, patterns, rules, stats)
* Suggest: 20% (advanced strategies discovered through play)
* Omit: 10% (lore can be mysterious, mechanics cannot)

**Example: Dark Souls**

* Build: Enemy patterns, stat effects, combat mechanics
* Suggest: Optimal strategies, hidden mechanics (community discovers)
* Omit: Lore explanations (but NOT mechanical information)

**Why this works:** Build enables mastery. Hidden mechanics frustrate optimization. Mystery in lore is fine, mystery in mechanics is unfair.

### Cozy/Submission: MEDIUM Build, LOW Omit

**Why:** Clarity = comfort, mystery = potential stress

**Typical ratio:**

* Build: 50% (what to do, how systems work, what's safe)
* Suggest: 30% (optional backstories, flavor, deeper meaning)
* Omit: 20% (some mysteries fine if clearly optional)

**Example: Book of Hours**

* Build: Library systems, book restoration, NPC requests
* Suggest: Deeper Hours mythology, historical connections
* Omit: Complete cosmology (hints exist but full answers don't)

**Why this works:** Build reduces anxiety. Too much Omit creates worry. Suggest adds optional depth without requirement.

### Discovery/Wonder: BALANCED

**Why:** Need concrete discoveries AND preserved mysteries

**Typical ratio:**

* Build: 40% (discoverable facts, world physics, findable lore)
* Suggest: 40% (connections between discoveries, deeper implications)
* Omit: 20% (ultimate mysteries that stay mysterious)

**Example: Outer Wilds**

* Build: Physics systems, planet contents, Nomai artifacts
* Suggest: Nomai story (assembled from fragments), quantum phenomena operation
* Omit: Why quantum effects exist, ultimate cosmic questions

**Why this works:** Build provides discoveries. Suggest enables synthesis. Omit preserves wonder even after "solving."

***

## The Decision Framework

For each major context element, ask these questions in sequence:

### Question 1: Is this mechanically necessary?

**Does the player need this information to make gameplay decisions?**

* YES → Lean toward Build
* NO → Continue to Question 2

**Example: Enemy attack pattern**

* Needed for combat decisions? YES
* **Decision: Build (show pattern through gameplay)**

**Example: Enemy backstory**

* Needed for combat decisions? NO
* **Continue to Question 2**

### Question 2: Does mystery enhance or obstruct?

**If player doesn't know this, does it create:**

* Productive mystery (engagement, investigation, wonder)
* Obstructive mystery (confusion, frustration, stalling)

**Productive → Suggest or Omit**
**Obstructive → Build**

**Example: Nomai appearance (Outer Wilds)**

* Mystery productive? YES (imagination enhances)
* **Decision: Suggest general form, Omit specifics**

**Example: How to save game**

* Mystery productive? NO (just frustrating)
* **Decision: Build (tutorial)**

### Question 3: What's your aesthetic goal?

**Check genre ratio guidelines above:**

* Mystery/Discovery → Favor Suggest
* Horror/Tension → Favor Omit
* Challenge/Mastery → Favor Build
* Cozy/Submission → Favor Build for mechanics, Suggest for lore
* Wonder → Balance all three

**Example: Creature motivation in horror game**

* Horror requires unknowable threat
* **Decision: Omit**

**Example: Clue in mystery game**

* Mystery requires discoverable evidence
* **Decision: Build evidence, Suggest connections**

### Question 4: Does specificity help or harm?

**If you show this in complete detail:**

* Does it enhance immersion? → Build
* Do glimpses/hints enable better imagination? → Suggest
* Does full view break the magic? → Omit

**Example: Detailed location (Martinaise in Disco)**

* Specificity enhances? YES (creates sense of place)
* **Decision: Build exhaustively**

**Example: Character appearance (Weather Factory)**

* Specificity enhances? NO (imagination better)
* **Decision: Omit, let players imagine**

### Question 5: Multiplayer coordination?

**Is this multiplayer? Do players need shared understanding?**

* YES → Build enough for coordination
* NO → Free to Suggest or Omit

**Example: Special infected abilities (L4D2)**

* Need coordination? YES
* **Decision: Build clearly**

**Example: Optional lore (any solo game)**

* Need coordination? NO
* **Decision: Can Suggest or Omit freely**

***

## Worked Example: Horror Game - The Alien

**Element: The Alien Creature**

**Perspective to maintain:** "Unknowable threat hunting vulnerable humans"

### Sub-element: Attack Behaviors

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* YES - players must respond to attacks
* **Lean toward Build**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* Obstructive - players need to survive
* **Build**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Horror)?**

* High Omit ratio BUT mechanics need clarity
* **Build behaviors, Omit motivations**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Knowing HOW it attacks = necessary
* Knowing WHY irrelevant
* **Build attack patterns**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Let's say solo
* **No additional Build needed**

**DECISION:**

* **Build:** Attack patterns (stalking, ambush, instant kill)
* **Build:** Detection methods (motion tracker bleeps)
* **Build:** Lethality (one hit = death or near-death)
* **Build:** Where it can go (vents, eventually everywhere)

### Sub-element: Physical Appearance

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* NO - appearance doesn't affect combat
* **Continue**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* YES - partial knowledge = fear
* **Suggest or Omit**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Horror)?**

* High Omit ratio
* Unknown scarier than known
* **Favor Suggest (glimpses) or Omit**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Full view could work (Aliens 1986)
* BUT glimpses maintain more fear
* **Suggest through glimpses**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Solo
* **Free to Suggest**

**DECISION:**

* **Suggest:** General form (biomechanical, teeth, tail)
* **Suggest:** Size and strength (through aftermath of attacks)
* **Suggest:** Parts in motion (tail swishing, teeth glimpsed)
* **Omit:** Complete full-body view (until climax if at all)

### Sub-element: Motivation and Intelligence

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* NO - motivation doesn't affect gameplay
* **Continue**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* YES - understanding would humanize
* **Suggest or Omit**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Horror)?**

* Unknowable threat perspective
* Understanding breaks horror
* **Omit**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Any explanation reduces fear
* "Just following instincts" = makes it understandable
* **Omit completely**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Solo
* **Free to Omit**

**DECISION:**

* **Omit:** Why it kills (no explanation)
* **Omit:** Creature's perspective (never shown)
* **Omit:** Origin or purpose (may hint at bioweapon but never confirm)
* **Suggest:** Intelligence through behavior (learns, adapts, hunts strategically)

### Sub-element: Lifecycle and Biology

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* NO - biology doesn't affect survival tactics
* **Continue**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* Partially - some might be interested
* But reduces unknowable to knowable
* **Lean toward Omit**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Horror)?**

* Scientific explanation = understanding
* Understanding = less scary
* **Omit**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Nature documentary framing breaks horror
* Keep alien, not animal
* **Omit**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Solo
* **Free to Omit**

**DECISION:**

* **Omit:** Breeding cycle
* **Omit:** Feeding habits
* **Omit:** Biological functions
* **Omit:** Scientific classification
* **Suggest:** Fragments only if absolutely necessary (corporate logs hint at bioweapon origin, but no details)

### Complete Profile: The Alien

**Build:**

* Attack behaviors (stalking, ambush, instant kill)
* Detection methods (motion tracker)
* Lethality (one hit kill or severe damage)
* Mobility (vents, all areas eventually)
* Can't be killed easily (escape is only option)

**Suggest:**

* Physical form (biomechanical, teeth, tail - glimpses only)
* Size and strength (through aftermath)
* Intelligence (learns, adapts)
* Possible origin (bioweapon hints)

**Omit:**

* Motivation (why it kills)
* Perspective (never from creature's view)
* Complete appearance (full view)
* Lifecycle and biology
* Scientific explanation

**Rationale:** Build enables survival gameplay. Suggest maintains threat while building fear. Omit preserves "unknowable threat" perspective essential to horror.

***

## Worked Example: Mystery Game - Crime Scene

**Element: Murder Scene**

**Perspective to maintain:** "Solvable puzzle through deduction"

### Sub-element: Physical Evidence

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* YES - evidence is core mechanic
* **Build**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* Obstructive without evidence
* Players need clues to investigate
* **Build**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Mystery)?**

* High Suggest ratio BUT core facts must be Build
* **Build evidence, Suggest connections**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Specific evidence enables deduction
* Vague evidence = frustration
* **Build specifically**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Could be co-op
* **Build to enable discussion**

**DECISION:**

* **Build:** Blood splatter pattern (indicates angle of attack)
* **Build:** Weapon found at scene (specific type, condition)
* **Build:** Time of death (medical evidence)
* **Build:** Position of body (how they fell)
* **Build:** Items in room (what's present, what's missing)

### Sub-element: Victim's Identity and Relationships

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* YES - identity affects who had motive
* **Build identity, Suggest relationships**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* Relationships productive (investigation target)
* **Suggest**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Mystery)?**

* High Suggest - investigation should reveal
* **Suggest through evidence and NPC testimony**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Identity must be clear
* Relationships discovered through investigation
* **Build identity, Suggest relationships**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Co-op players must agree on facts
* **Build identity clearly**

**DECISION:**

* **Build:** Victim's name, occupation, basic facts
* **Build:** Where they lived, public information
* **Suggest:** Secret relationships (discovered through letters, NPC gossip)
* **Suggest:** Hidden motivations (financial records, diary fragments)
* **Suggest:** Conflicts (multiple NPCs provide different perspectives)

### Sub-element: Killer's Identity

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* YES - this is what players must discover
* **But Omit until discovered**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* VERY productive - this IS the mystery
* **Omit until solved**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Mystery)?**

* Solvable puzzle perspective
* Must be discoverable through deduction
* **Omit answer, Build path to answer**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Answer must be specific when discovered
* But hidden until earned
* **Omit until solved, then Build confirmation**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Co-op must agree on solution
* **System must confirm when solved**

**DECISION:**

* **Omit:** Killer's identity (until player deduces)
* **Build:** Clues that point to killer (scattered evidence)
* **Suggest:** Connections between evidence (player synthesizes)
* **Build:** Confirmation when correct solution reached
* **Build:** Why answer is correct (show logical chain when revealed)

### Sub-element: Red Herrings

**Question 1: Mechanically necessary?**

* YES for challenge - too easy without
* **Build red herring, make discoverable as false**

**Question 2: Mystery productive?**

* YES - creates deduction challenge
* BUT must be ultimately discoverable
* **Build as plausible, Suggest flaws**

**Question 3: Aesthetic (Mystery)?**

* Solvable puzzle needs fair misdirection
* Unfair red herrings break trust
* **Build plausibly, Suggest inconsistencies**

**Question 4: Specificity?**

* Must seem as specific as real evidence
* But contain discoverable flaws
* **Build in detail with subtle contradictions**

**Question 5: Multiplayer?**

* Co-op can debate red herrings
* **Build clearly enough to discuss**

**DECISION:**

* **Build:** False suspect with apparent motive
* **Build:** Misleading evidence (planted or coincidental)
* **Suggest:** Inconsistencies that reveal false lead (timeline doesn't work, alibi holds up)
* **Build:** Proof of innocence when investigated thoroughly
* **Omit:** That this IS a red herring (players must discover)

### Complete Profile: Crime Scene

**Build:**

* Physical evidence (blood, weapon, body position, items)
* Victim identity and public information
* Time and method of death
* Location details
* Access to scene (who could get there)
* Red herring evidence (but must be disprovable)

**Suggest:**

* Victim's secret relationships (letters, diary, NPC testimony)
* Suspect motivations (financial records, overheard arguments)
* Connections between clues (player deduces)
* Red herring flaws (subtle timeline inconsistencies)

**Omit:**

* Killer's identity (until player solves)
* How clues connect (until player figures out)
* Which leads are false (until investigated)
* Complete backstory (maintain some mystery even after solving)

**Rationale:** Build gives fair puzzle pieces. Suggest enables investigation and deduction. Omit preserves mystery until earned through logic.

***

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Over-Building (Too Much Explicit Detail)

**Symptom:**

* Players overwhelmed by exposition
* Mystery solved before investigation
* Imagination constrained by specification
* Discovery aesthetic fails

**Example:**
Mystery game that shows killer in opening cutscene, then asks players to "investigate."

**Fix:**
Move critical information from Build to Suggest or Omit. Let players discover through investigation, not exposition.

### Mistake 2: Under-Building (Too Little Core Information)

**Symptom:**

* Players confused about basics
* Can't make informed decisions
* Investigation stalls (no path forward)
* Frustration not engagement

**Example:**
Mystery game where clues are so vague players can't even begin investigating.

**Fix:**
Build mechanical necessities and core facts. Suggest connections and implications. Don't Omit essential information.

### Mistake 3: Suggesting Without Foundation

**Symptom:**

* Hints that go nowhere
* Fragments that never resolve
* Promising mystery with no payoff
* Players feel cheated

**Example:**
Game drops mysterious hints throughout but never provides enough information to solve or understand them.

**Fix:**
Suggest must eventually lead somewhere. Either Build the answer (eventually) or make clear some mysteries are permanent. Don't promise answers you won't deliver.

### Mistake 4: Omitting What Should Be Built

**Symptom:**

* Mystery about basic game mechanics
* Players can't learn how to play
* Fairness violated (hidden information needed for decisions)
* Challenge becomes guessing

**Example:**
Horror game that doesn't explain how to save, leading to player deaths from not knowing basic systems.

**Fix:**
Omit lore freely, but Build mechanics and basic survival information. Mystery should enhance, not obstruct.

### Mistake 5: Building What Should Be Omitted

**Symptom:**

* Horror becomes nature documentary
* Mystery solved by exposition
* Wonder reduced to mundane explanation
* Perspective broken by over-explanation

**Example:**
Horror game with extensive codex entries explaining alien biology, lifecycle, and motivations in scientific detail.

**Fix:**
Respect the power of unknown. Some things engage better through mystery than through complete explanation.

***

## Integration with LLM Systems

**Note:** This section provides preliminary guidance. Detailed LLM integration will be covered in future chapters.

### The LLM Over-Explanation Risk

**Problem:** LLMs tend to answer questions completely when asked.

**Example:**

```
Player: "What does the alien look like?"
LLM: [Generates detailed physical description]
```

**This breaks Suggest/Omit decisions if appearance should stay mysterious.**

### Constraining LLM to Maintain Categories

**Solution: System prompts must enforce Build/Suggest/Omit boundaries**

**Example system prompt:**

```
You are maintaining a horror game perspective. 

The alien creature must remain "unknowable threat."

When players ask about the alien:
- You MAY describe: Behaviors, attacks, sounds, general threat
- You MAY suggest: Glimpses of appearance, traces left behind
- You MUST NOT reveal: Complete appearance, motivations, origins, biology

If asked directly "What does the alien look like?", respond with:
- A glimpse or partial view
- Environmental reaction (shadows, sounds)
- Effects not causes (aftermath of attack, not detailed anatomy)

Maintain mystery. Partial knowledge creates fear.
```

### Different Constraints by Category

**For Build elements:**

```
LLM can answer directly and completely.
Example: "How do I use the motion tracker?" → Full explanation
```

**For Suggest elements:**

```
LLM provides fragments, hints, partial information.
Example: "Who is this character?" → Hints from appearance, dialogue, context
Not complete backstory
```

**For Omit elements:**

```
LLM deflects, maintains mystery, or provides in-world uncertainty.
Example: "Why does the alien kill?" → "Nobody knows. It just hunts."
Not: Complete biological explanation
```

### Validation

**Test LLM responses:**

* Does this answer maintain perspective?
* Does it respect Build/Suggest/Omit boundaries?
* Would a player getting this response break the experience?

**If LLM over-explains:**
Tighten system prompt constraints or add explicit forbidden topics list.

## Summary: Strategic Detail Decision Framework

### For Each Context Element:

**1. Check Mechanical Necessity**

* Required for gameplay decisions? → Build
* Not required? → Continue

**2. Check Mystery Value**

* Productive mystery? → Suggest or Omit
* Obstructive mystery? → Build

**3. Check Aesthetic Requirements**

* Mystery/Discovery → High Suggest
* Horror/Tension → High Omit
* Challenge/Mastery → High Build
* Cozy/Submission → Medium Build, Low Omit
* Wonder → Balanced

**4. Check Specificity Impact**

* Detail enhances? → Build
* Glimpses better? → Suggest
* Full view breaks magic? → Omit

**5. Check Multiplayer Needs**

* Coordination required? → Build
* Solo experience? → Free to Suggest/Omit

### The Three Categories in Practice:

**Build:** Core facts, mechanics, evidence, shared understanding
**Suggest:** Connections, implications, atmosphere, optional depth
**Omit:** Ultimate answers, perspective breaks, irrelevant details

### Validation Questions:

**Too much Build?**

* Players overwhelmed by exposition?
* Mystery solved too early?
* Imagination constrained?

**Too little Build?**

* Players confused about basics?
* Can't make decisions?
* Investigation blocked?

**Good Suggest?**

* Players form theories?
* Connections feel earned?
* Fragments lead somewhere?

**Too much Suggest?**

* Players frustrated, can't solve?
* Hints go nowhere?
* All mystery, no answers?

**Good Omit?**

* Mystery enhances engagement?
* Absence serves perspective?
* Players wonder productively?

**Too much Omit?**

* Players confused about essentials?
* Mystery becomes arbitrary?
* Frustration not engagement?

**Next: Part 6 - From Genre to Design Document**

You know what perspective to maintain and what to Build/Suggest/Omit. Now you need to create an actual design document—the blueprint for building your context.
