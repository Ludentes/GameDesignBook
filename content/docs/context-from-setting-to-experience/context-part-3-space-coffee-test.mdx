# Part 3: The Space Coffee Test

## What Is Space Coffee?

The term "space coffee" originates from science fiction writing criticism. It describes the lazy practice of taking contemporary Earth objects or concepts and adding "space" as a prefix without meaningfully transforming them for the fictional setting.

**Examples in bad sci-fi:**

* Space coffee (coffee, but in space)
* Space elevator (elevator, but in space)
* Space bureaucracy (bureaucracy, but in space)
* Space capitalism (capitalism, but in space)

**Why it's lazy:** These additions don't engage with the setting. They're contemporary Earth concepts with "space" painted on. The setting is cosmetic, not transformative.

**Applied to game design:** "Space coffee" describes context that's interchangeable without changing the experience.

***

## The Problem at Scale

Mass Effect: Andromeda spent approximately $100 million on detailed context:

* Multiple alien planets with unique biomes
* Several alien species with extensive backstories
* Hundreds of codex entries
* Carefully crafted exploration and survival lore

**The space coffee test:** Could you replace "alien planet exploration" with "fantasy continent exploration" without changing gameplay?

**The answer:** Yes. Completely.

* Gather resources → Same mechanic
* Combat encounters → Same mechanic
* Quest structures → Same mechanic
* Companion approval → Same mechanic
* Outpost building → Same mechanic
* Crafting → Same mechanic

**The sci-fi setting was space coffee.** Expensive, detailed, beautiful space coffee. But space coffee nonetheless.

***

## The Space Coffee Test

**The fundamental question:**

**"Could I reskin this game with completely different context without changing anything else?"**

**If YES → You have space coffee** (context is cosmetic)
**If NO → You have meaningful context** (context is load-bearing)

***

## Testing Methodology

### Step 1: Identify Core Mechanics

**What are the actual actions players take?**

* What systems drive gameplay?
* What creates the core loop?
* What determines success/failure?

**Example - Andromeda:**

* Explore open world
* Gather resources
* Fight enemies
* Complete quests
* Build outposts
* Upgrade gear

### Step 2: Propose Alternative Context

**Take same mechanics, different setting:**

* Sci-fi exploration → Fantasy exploration
* Space aliens → Fantasy races
* Planets → Continents/kingdoms
* Technology → Magic

**For Andromeda:**

* Explore fantasy world
* Gather herbs/minerals
* Fight monsters
* Complete quests
* Build villages
* Upgrade equipment

### Step 3: Ask Critical Questions

□ **Do mechanics still work identically?**

* Same strategies optimal?
* Same decisions meaningful?
* Same challenge level?

□ **Does player experience change?**

* Different feeling/atmosphere?
* Different meaning to actions?
* Different emotional response?

□ **Does context constrain mechanics?**

* Are certain actions impossible in new context?
* Do new actions become possible?
* Does internal logic shift?

### Step 4: Evaluate Results

**PASS (meaningful context):**

* Mechanics break in different setting
* Experience fundamentally changes
* Context provides essential constraints
* Reskinning impossible without redesign

**FAIL (space coffee):**

* Mechanics work identically
* Only art/text changes
* Experience unchanged
* Context is just skin

***

## The Five Levels

Context integration exists on a spectrum from pure cosmetic to inseparable.

### Level 1: Pure Cosmetic (Worst for Context-Focused Games)

**Definition:** Only art and text change, zero mechanical difference

**Examples:**

* Poker with space-themed cards (hearts → nebulas, diamonds → stars)
* Monopoly with Star Wars properties
* Chess with fantasy piece designs

**Detection:**

* Swap assets in 5 minutes
* Game plays identically
* Players notice art change, nothing else
* Strategies completely unchanged

**When this is acceptable:**

* Abstract games where theme is optional (chess, poker, checkers)
* Games marketed as "themed version" (players know it's cosmetic)

**When this is a problem:**

* Game promises rich world but setting doesn't matter
* Context budget wasted (could have been abstract)
* Players feel misled ("Why does this setting exist?")

**Verdict:** Not inherently bad, but honest about being cosmetic.

***

### Level 2: Shallow Integration (Common Problem)

**Definition:** Context affects flavor text and presentation, but not mechanics

**Examples:**

* Medieval city builder vs Space station builder
  * Same mechanics: Gather resources, build structures, manage population
  * Different art and descriptions
  * Identical optimal strategies
* Fantasy RPG vs Sci-fi RPG with same quest structures
  * "Kill 10 rats" vs "Kill 10 space rats"
  * Different names, same gameplay

**Detection:**

* Tutorial teaches same concepts (just different words)
* Strategy guides transfer directly
* Players use same approaches
* Only aesthetics differ

**Why this happens:**

* Designer starts with mechanics, adds setting later
* Setting chosen for marketing, not design
* "We need fantasy version AND sci-fi version" reskins

**What's missing:**

* Setting-specific constraints
* Mechanics that only make sense in this context
* Decisions shaped by world logic

**How to fix:**

* Make context constrain mechanics
* If medieval city has walls, make walls matter (sieges, defense)
* If space station has vacuum, make vacuum matter (airlocks, decompression)
* Let setting create unique problems

**Example fix - City builder:**

* Medieval: Walls protect from sieges (new mechanic: defense)
* Space station: Vacuum requires life support (new mechanic: oxygen management)
* Now they're not just reskins

**Verdict:** Most games are stuck here. Context exists but doesn't deeply matter.

***

### Level 3: Mechanical Flavor (Better But Still Shallow)

**Definition:** Context creates minor mechanical variations, but core system unchanged

**Examples:**

* **Borderlands weapon manufacturers:**
  * Jakobs: High damage, slow fire rate, no elemental
  * Maliwan: Elemental focus, charge time
  * Tediore: Throw to reload (explodes)
  * Hyperion: Accuracy increases while firing
  * **Same core:** Procedural weapons with stat variations
  * **Difference:** Each manufacturer has personality
  * **But:** Core loop identical (shoot, loot, level)

**Detection:**

* Variations exist but follow same template
* Different flavors of same mechanics
* Could create "generic" version that encompasses all
* Strategic choices, but within narrow band

**Why this is better than Level 2:**

* At least context creates some mechanical identity
* Player can prefer one flavor over another
* Setting gives meaning to stat differences

**Why this isn't enough:**

* Core experience unchanged
* Could still reskin entire system
* Variations are horizontal, not fundamental

**Borderlands-specific analysis:**

* **Weapon manufacturers:** Level 3 (mechanical flavor, cosmetic)
* **Spell schools (Wonderlands):** Level 4+ (genre-specific, load-bearing)
* **Same game, different systems, different integration levels**

**This proves:** Context operates at system level, not just game level.

**Verdict:** Acceptable for some systems, but not sufficient for context-focused games.

***

### Level 4: Context Constrains Mechanics (Good - Minimum Target)

**Definition:** Context creates opportunities AND limitations; mechanics derive from setting

**Examples:**

**Blades in the Dark:**

* Context: Victorian haunted city, criminal underworld
* Genre: Heist + supernatural horror

**Setting-specific mechanics:**

* **Devil's Bargain:** Literal devils and ghosts offer help (supernatural context)
* **Attune to ghosts:** Only works in haunted world
* **Flashbacks:** Victorian investigation pace enables retroactive planning
* **Heat/Wanted:** Corrupt watch system (not modern police)
* **Stress → Trauma:** Occult horror wears you down
* **Crew types:** Victorian underworld structures (assassins, smugglers, cultists)

**Test:** Could you run this in modern corporate espionage setting?

* **Answer:** NO. Most mechanics break or lose meaning.
* Devil's Bargain requires supernatural
* Attune requires ghosts
* Heat system assumes corrupt watch not modern police
* Stress/trauma tied to occult horror

**Result:** Context is load-bearing. Setting enables specific mechanics.

**XCOM 2:**

* Context: Earth occupied by aliens, you're underground resistance

**Setting-specific mechanics (strategic layer):**

* **Resource scarcity:** You're rebels, not military (limited supplies)
* **Timed missions:** Aliens have dark events (urgency from occupation)
* **Stealth emphasis:** You're outnumbered (occupation creates power imbalance)
* **Base limitations:** Hiding from aliens (can't build openly)
* **Resistance network:** Recruit rebels (occupation creates resistance)

**Test:** Could you run this as traditional military vs aliens?

* **Answer:** NO. Strategic layer breaks.
* Scarcity makes sense for rebels, not military
* Stealth emphasis from being outnumbered
* Base hiding from occupation

**BUT:** Tactical combat (Level 3) works in any setting

* Cover mechanics work anywhere
* Abilities are just sci-fi flavored tactics

**Result:** Hybrid. Strategic layer = Level 4, Tactical layer = Level 3.

**Detection:**

* Changing context requires redesigning mechanics
* Setting creates unique opportunities
* Setting imposes meaningful constraints
* Some mechanics only make sense here

**Verdict:** This is the minimum for context-focused games. Context matters mechanically.

***

### Level 5: Context IS the System (Best - Aspiration)

**Definition:** Mechanics derive entirely from context; inseparable

**Example: Disco Elysium**

**Context:** Martinaise - specific broken district in specific failed revolution

**Context-derived mechanics:**

* **Shivers skill:** Genius loci of Martinaise specifically
  * Only makes sense in this exact place
  * Couldn't exist in generic city
  * The city speaks through you

* **24 Skills as voices:** Fragmented detective psyche
  * Reflects specific character's breakdown
  * Electrochemistry, Ancient Reptilian Brain, Inland Empire
  * Each skill is character-specific perspective

* **Political alignments:** Post-revolutionary context
  * Communist, fascist, moralist, ultraliberal
  * Only relevant in failed revolution setting
  * Mechanics encode political reality

* **Class warfare mechanics:** Revachol's specific poverty
  * Union conflict with Wild Pines
  * Dockworkers vs shipping company
  * This specific economic collapse

**Test:** Could you reskin Disco Elysium?
**Answer:** Absolutely not.

* Remove Martinaise → Shivers skill impossible
* Remove failed revolution → Political mechanics meaningless
* Remove this specific detective → Skills make no sense
* Change any major context → Entire game breaks

**The context doesn't just constrain mechanics. The context IS the mechanics.**

**Example: Outer Wilds**

**Context:** 22-minute time loop, solar system about to die, ancient mystery

**Context-derived mechanics:**

* **Death resets knowledge only:** Only works with time loop
* **Time pressure from supernova:** Exactly 22 minutes, unavoidable
* **Interconnected discoveries:** Specific planets, specific clues
* **Quantum mechanics:** Specific to this universe's physics
* **Nomai story:** Ancient civilization specific to this system

**Test:** Could you reskin Outer Wilds?
**Answer:** No.

* Different setting → Different physics → Different puzzles
* Remove time loop → Entire structure breaks
* Different ancient race → Different story → Different investigation
* This is bespoke, not generic

**Detection:**

* Cannot reskin at all
* Context generates mechanics
* Mechanics only make sense here
* Removing context destroys game entirely
* Design started with context, derived mechanics from it

**Verdict:** Aspiration for context-focused games. Perfect integration.

***

## System-Level vs Game-Level Integration

**Critical insight from Borderlands/Wonderlands:**

The same game can have different integration levels for different systems.

**Borderlands 2:**

* **Procedural weapons:** Level 2-3 (shallow integration)
  * Manufacturer variations are flavor
  * Core loop unchanged
  * Could be fantasy loot, space loot, modern loot
* **Overall game:** Space coffee for weapon system

**Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (Borderlands spinoff):**

* **Procedural weapons:** Still Level 2-3 (fantasy skin on same system)
* **Spell system:** Level 4 (fantasy-specific mechanics)
  * Spells are fundamentally different from guns
  * Magic requires fantasy context
  * Can't just reskin as sci-fi
* **Melee system:** Level 4 (fantasy-appropriate close combat)

**Same game engine, different systems, different integration levels.**

**Lesson:** Context integration is per-system, not per-game.

You can have:

* Core combat: Level 4 (context-constrained)
* Loot system: Level 2 (cosmetic)
* Social system: Level 5 (context IS system)

**All in one game. This is fine if intentional.**

***

## How to Use the Test

### As Evaluation Tool

**For existing designs:**

1. **List core systems** (combat, exploration, social, progression, etc.)
2. **For each system, ask:** "Could I reskin this without changing mechanics?"
3. **Rate each system:** Level 1-5
4. **Identify weak points:** Which systems are space coffee?
5. **Decide:** Is this acceptable or should it improve?

**Example evaluation - Mystery game:**

| System        | Current Level              | Should Be | Action                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Investigation | 5 (mystery-specific)       | 5         | ✓ Good                 |
| Combat        | 2 (generic)                | N/A       | Acceptable (not focus) |
| Social        | 4 (Victorian class system) | 4         | ✓ Good                 |
| Progression   | 2 (generic XP)             | 3-4       | Needs improvement      |

### As Diagnostic Tool

**When setting "doesn't feel important":**

1. **Apply space coffee test to each system**
2. **Find the weak integration** (which systems are cosmetic?)
3. **Ask:** Should this system integrate more deeply?
4. **If yes:** Redesign to let context constrain it
5. **If no:** Accept it's cosmetic (that's okay for some systems)

**Example diagnosis:**

"Players say setting doesn't matter in our fantasy game."

Test reveals:

* Combat: Level 2 (could be any genre)
* Magic system: Level 3 (stat variations only)
* Social system: Level 1 (generic)

**Diagnosis:** Only magic even tries. Everything else is space coffee.

**Fix options:**

* Make combat fantasy-specific (Monster Hunter model: weapons for creature types)
* Make magic context-derived (Blades model: dangerous, corrupt, specific)
* Make social system use fantasy class/race dynamics

### As Design Tool

**Before building:**

1. **Choose target integration level per system**
2. **For Level 4-5 systems:** Start with context, derive mechanics
3. **For Level 2-3 systems:** Accept cosmetic, don't waste effort
4. **For Level 1 systems:** Consider making abstract instead

**Example design planning:**

"Making horror survival game"

**System integration targets:**

* Threat mechanics: **Level 5** (context IS system - alien specifically)
* Resource management: **Level 4** (scarcity from context)
* Environment: **Level 4** (ship layout matters for horror)
* Combat: **Level 3** (generic shooting is fine)
* Inventory: **Level 1** (abstract slots, don't care)

**Result:** Focused effort. Deep integration where it matters, accept cosmetic where it doesn't.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: "Everything Must Be Level 5"

**Problem:** Not every system needs deep integration
**Reality:** Some systems should be simple/abstract
**Example:** Inventory management doesn't need to be bespoke
**Fix:** Choose integration levels strategically

### Mistake 2: "Level 1-2 Is Always Bad"

**Problem:** Context-light games can be excellent
**Reality:** Chess, Go, poker are Level 1 (pure abstract) and timeless
**Example:** Into the Breach has minimal context, excellent gameplay
**Fix:** Match integration level to design goals

### Mistake 3: "Reskinnable = Failure"

**Problem:** Some successful games reskin well
**Reality:** If genre is strong, dressing can be cosmetic
**Example:** Fighting games reskin constantly (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken)
**Fix:** Know what's load-bearing (fighting mechanics) vs cosmetic (characters)

### Mistake 4: "We Have Lore, Therefore Deep Context"

**Problem:** Lore ≠ mechanical integration
**Reality:** Andromeda had extensive lore, still space coffee
**Example:** Codex entries don't make context matter if mechanics ignore them
**Fix:** Context must constrain mechanics, not just flavor them

### Mistake 5: "Same Setting = Same Integration"

**Problem:** Assuming all systems integrate equally
**Reality:** Different systems can have different integration levels
**Example:** Borderlands weapons (Level 2) vs Wonderlands spells (Level 4)
**Fix:** Evaluate per-system, not per-game

***

## When Space Coffee Is Acceptable

### Abstract Games

**Games where theme is optional:**

* Chess with different piece designs
* Poker with various art styles
* Tetris with texture packs

**Why it's okay:** Players understand theme is cosmetic. No pretense of integration.

### Mechanics-First Games

**Puzzle games where mechanics are the point:**

* Portal (mechanics are core, context enhances but isn't necessary)
* Baba Is You (pure abstract with cute dressing)
* Into the Breach (minimalist context, tactical mechanics)

**Why it's okay:** Context enhances but doesn't define. Mechanics carry the experience.

### Themed Versions

**Explicit reskins of existing games:**

* "Star Wars Monopoly"
* "Pokemon Chess"
* "Fallout Solitaire"

**Why it's okay:** Honest marketing. Players know it's \[game] with \[theme] painted on.

**When this becomes a problem:** Marketing as "rich world" when it's just themed abstract game.

***

## The FTL Comparison

**FTL (Faster Than Light)** chose minimal context deliberately:

**Context provided:**

* Simple premise: Deliver data to federation, avoid rebels
* Sector structure: 8 sectors to cross
* Ship variety: Different ships, different playstyles
* Events: Procedural encounters

**Context NOT provided:**

* Why this war started
* What the data contains
* Who you are specifically
* Deep faction lore
* Character backstories

**Space coffee test result:**

* Could reskin as ocean voyage, land journey, anything
* Core mechanics (resource management, tactical combat, routing) unchanged

**But it works because:**

* Doesn't pretend to be deep context
* Minimal context supports tactical focus
* Players accept it's mechanics-first
* Roguelike structure expects thin narrative

**Lesson:** Minimal context done honestly > Deep context done poorly

**Contrast with Andromeda:**

* Tried for deep context (huge lore, detailed worlds)
* Failed to integrate it (still space coffee mechanically)
* Players expected context to matter (marketing promised)
* Disappointment from mismatch

**FTL succeeded with Level 2 integration because it never promised more.**
**Andromeda failed with Level 2 integration because it promised Level 4-5.**

***

## Validation Questions

**For each system in your game, ask:**

□ **Could this system work in a completely different setting?**

* If YES easily → Low integration (Level 1-2)
* If YES with changes → Medium integration (Level 3)
* If NO, breaks entirely → High integration (Level 4-5)

□ **Does context create unique mechanics here?**

* If NO → Space coffee (cosmetic only)
* If SOME → Mechanical flavor (variations)
* If YES → Context-constrained (good integration)

□ **Does removing context break the system?**

* If NO → Context is decoration
* If PARTIALLY → Some integration exists
* If YES → Context is load-bearing

□ **Do players care about context when playing this system?**

* If NO → Context doesn't matter to experience
* If SOMETIMES → Context adds flavor
* If YES → Context shapes decisions

□ **Is this integration level intentional and appropriate?**

* If YES → Good (matches design goals)
* If NO → Problem (either over/under-integrated)

***

## Target Integration Levels by Aesthetic

**Different aesthetics need different integration:**

**Discovery aesthetic:** Level 4-5

* Mystery is the point
* Context must matter mechanically
* Investigation requires setting-specific clues

**Narrative aesthetic:** Level 4-5

* Story inseparable from context
* Choices only meaningful in specific context
* Characters defined by their world

**Challenge aesthetic:** Level 2-3 acceptable

* Mechanics are the point
* Context can be minimal (chess, Into the Breach)
* But Level 4 works too (XCOM, Monster Hunter)

**Mastery aesthetic:** Level 1-3 acceptable

* System optimization is the point
* Context optional (fighting games, competitive strategy)
* Abstract often better (chess, Go)

**Fellowship aesthetic:** Level 2-4

* Social interaction is the point
* Context provides framework
* Can be light (Catan) or heavy (MMO raiding)

**Submission aesthetic:** Level 1-2 often best

* Simplicity is the point
* Deep context adds unwanted complexity
* Cozy settings work (Animal Crossing) but mechanics stay simple

## What You've Learned

You now understand:

✅ **What space coffee is** - interchangeable context
✅ **The five integration levels** - from pure cosmetic to inseparable
✅ **How to test your context** - reskinning thought experiment
✅ **System-level integration** - different systems, different levels
✅ **When space coffee is acceptable** - abstract games, honest theming
✅ **Target levels by aesthetic** - what integration serves which goals

**Key takeaway:** Context integration is not binary (good/bad). It's a spectrum with appropriate levels for different goals.

**Next step:** Now that you know your context should matter, learn how to maintain the perspective that creates your aesthetic.
