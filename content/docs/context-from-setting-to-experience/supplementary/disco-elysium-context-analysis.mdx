# Context Analysis: Disco Elysium

**Game:** Disco Elysium (2019)\
**Designer/Studio:** ZA/UM (Robert Kurvitz, lead designer/writer)\
**Genre:** CRPG, detective RPG, narrative-focused\
**Primary Aesthetics:** Narrative, Discovery, Expression\
**Analysis Focus:** Success - context as primary system, setting drives mechanics

***

## Part 1: The Intended Experience

**What should players feel?**

* Disorientation and fragmentation (you're broken, remembering who you are)
* Political/philosophical engagement (ideology permeates everything)
* Melancholic beauty (Revachol is dying but sublime)
* Dark humor and tragedy intertwined
* The weight of history and failure

**What should players want to do?**

* Solve the murder (ostensible goal)
* Understand yourself (internal mystery)
* Explore Revachol (city as character)
* Engage with ideologies (political thought as gameplay)
* Talk to everyone (dialogue is the game)

**What should players remember afterward?**

* Specific conversations (Kim, Cuno, Joyce, the Deserter)
* Moments of self-discovery ("I am the law," tribunal scene)
* The feeling of Martinaise (specific place, not generic city)
* Which political ideology they embraced
* The tragedy of the case resolution

**Marketing promise:**
"A detective RPG where you ARE the mystery. Explore a city in decay and solve a murder while piecing together who you used to be."

***

## Part 2: Context Design Choices

### What Context Was Built (Extensively)

**Revachol as Specific Place:**

* Post-revolutionary city under foreign occupation
* Martinaise district: dockworkers, union, failed commercial area
* Class struggle (union vs. Wild Pines corporation)
* Architectural decay (communist housing blocks crumbling)
* The Pale (reality-breaking phenomenon outside cities)

**Political Framework:**

* Four quadrants (communism, fascism, moralism, ultraliberalism)
* Each ideology has internal logic and contradictions
* Not good/bad binary - all are explored seriously
* Player character's ideology emerges through dialogue choices

**Historical Depth:**

* Failed revolution 50 years ago (the Commune)
* Current occupation by Coalition of Nations
* Economic collapse and decline
* Cultural layers (Revacholian, Suresne, international)

**Internal Voices (24 Skills as Characters):**

* Each skill is personality fragment
* Skills argue with you and each other
* Stats shape internal monologue
* Your brain is broken, skills compensate

### What Context Does (Mechanically)

**Setting as Constraint Framework:**

* Class struggle makes union/corporation conflict inevitable
* Post-revolutionary setting makes political discourse central
* Martinaise's decay makes certain actions make sense (squalor, desperation)
* The Case happens BECAUSE of this specific context

**Ideology as Character System:**

* Traditional stats (Strength, Dexterity) replaced with ideas
* "What do you believe?" is character creation
* Beliefs have mechanical consequences
* Context determines what thoughts are available

**Skills as Internal World:**

* 24 different perspectives on every situation
* Your brain is an ecosystem
* Skills reflect and create your ideology
* Context is internal AND external

### Strategic Absence (What's NOT Detailed)

**Deliberately vague:**

* Your character's past (fragments only, you choose interpretation)
* Life outside Martinaise (other districts mentioned, not shown)
* Global politics (Coalition exists, but abstract)
* The Pale's exact nature (mystery preserved)

**Why minimal:**

* Your past: Player projects themselves
* Other districts: Martinaise is the focus, specificity matters
* Global: Zooming out would dilute Martinaise's texture
* Pale: Some mysteries should stay mysterious

***

## Part 3: Context-Mechanic Relationship

### How Context Constrains Mechanics

**No Combat (Mostly):**

* You're a broken detective, not action hero
* Violence exists but isn't solution (tribunal shows consequences)
* Detective work is dialogue and thought
* Reflects noir/procedural genre, not power fantasy

**Skill System Reflects Setting:**

* Shivers (genius loci) only works in Revachol (place-specific)
* Rhetoric/Conceptualization (political thought) is mechanical
* Physical Instrument (violence) is option but not primary
* Inland Empire (imagination/madness) reflects broken mind

**Dialogue as Primary Mechanic:**

* In class-struggle city, talking is action
* Persuasion, authority, rhetoric all have mechanical weight
* Skills interrupt conversations (internal voices matter)
* Social situations ARE the gameplay

**Thought Cabinet:**

* Ideas as equipable items (beliefs have stat effects)
* Research thoughts over time (ideology takes effort)
* Contradictory thoughts possible (you can be inconsistent)
* Mechanizes philosophical engagement

### How Mechanics Support Context

**Skill Checks Reveal Character:**

* Failing checks often more interesting (drunken mess vs. competent)
* Internal voices show your brokenness
* Success/failure both advance story (no dead ends)
* Your stats shape what you perceive (not objective reality)

**Political Alignment Emerges:**

* No "choose ideology" screen
* Your dialogue choices accumulate
* Game tracks tendencies, assigns alignment
* Reflects how real political identity forms

**The Case Structure:**

* Murder mystery provides framework (classic detective)
* But solving it requires understanding Martinaise
* Cannot separate case from context
* Setting IS the mystery as much as victim

### The "Space Coffee" Test

**Could you reskin this?**

* NO. The case only makes sense in post-revolutionary context
* NO. The ideologies require specific historical setting
* NO. Martinaise's texture is irreplaceable
* Context is load-bearing at every level

**What would break:**

* Different city loses Revachol's specificity (generic ruins)
* Different politics loses ideological depth (shallow takes)
* Different case loses thematic resonance (random murder)
* Different skills lose internal logic (why these 24?)

**This is maximally context-dependent design.** No other game could tell this story.

***

## Part 4: Context-Aesthetic Coherence

### Narrative Aesthetic Success

**Context AS Narrative:**

* Setting tells story (every location has history)
* Architecture narrates (failed utopia, current decay)
* Characters embody themes (each represents ideology/class)
* Even UI reflects world (thought cabinet, skills as voices)

**Multiple Narrative Layers:**

* Surface: Murder mystery
* Middle: Who are you? (personal mystery)
* Deep: What is Revachol? (historical/political mystery)
* Meta: What does it mean to be human in failed world?

**All layers interweave - solving murder requires understanding all levels.**

### Discovery Aesthetic Success

**Exploration is Intellectual:**

* Discover Revachol's history through conversations
* Uncover political theory through skill checks
* Learn about yourself through internal dialogue
* Find connections between personal/political/historical

**Every Conversation Reveals:**

* Not just plot information
* But character, theme, world, philosophy
* Joyce's lorry conversation teaches economics
* Evrart's dialogue teaches corruption and charm
* Each NPC is window into world

### Expression Aesthetic Success

**Your Detective is Yours:**

* Build ideology through choices (not pre-set)
* Internal voices reflect your stats (different for each build)
* Can be communist, fascist, centrist, apolitical
* Can be functional detective or complete disaster
* Game validates all approaches (no "correct" politics)

**Thought Cabinet Enables Roleplay:**

* Internalize ideas that fit your character
* Research contradictory thoughts (complexity allowed)
* Mechanical benefits reflect ideological commitment
* You are building philosophy, not min-maxing

***

## Part 5: Success Analysis

### What Worked

**1. Maximal Context, Minimal Explanation**

Disco Elysium has ENORMOUS lore (history, politics, culture) but:

* Never dumps exposition
* Information emerges through natural conversation
* You can ignore politics and focus on case (game allows)
* Or dive deep into theory (game rewards)

**Example:** The Pale

* Mentioned frequently, crucial to world
* Never explained in exposition dump
* Understanding emerges from fragments
* Some mystery deliberately preserved
* You feel it more than understand it

**2. Context-Driven Character System**

Skills aren't generic stats - they're specific to this world:

* Shivers connects to Revachol specifically
* Esprit de Corps shows other RCM officers (your organization)
* Inland Empire reflects specific kind of brokenness
* Skills wouldn't work in different setting

**This means:** Character system and setting are inseparable.

**3. Politics as Gameplay**

Most games avoid politics or treat it superficially. Disco makes it central:

* Four quadrants all given serious treatment
* Game lets you be fascist, communist, etc. (but shows consequences)
* Ideologies have internal logic and contradictions
* No "correct" answer (moralism seems centrist but has its own issues)

**This works because:**

* Setting REQUIRES political engagement (class struggle is the context)
* Mechanics support it (thought cabinet, rhetoric checks)
* Writing treats all ideologies seriously (even when mocking them)

**4. Failure as Content**

Failed skill checks aren't roadblocks:

* Often more interesting than success
* Reveal character (you're a mess, it's okay)
* Advance story differently (not dead end)
* Support multiple builds (high/low INT both viable)

**Example:** Try to kick door open with low Physical

* Fail, hurt yourself, look foolish
* Kim's reaction reveals his character
* You learn about yourself (not strong, maybe that's okay)
* Still progress (find another way)

### Key Innovation

**Context as Primary System:**

* Most RPGs: Mechanics primary, setting is skin
* Disco: Setting primary, mechanics serve it
* Cannot separate Martinaise from skill system
* Cannot separate case from political context

**This pattern:** Design setting first, derive mechanics from it.

### Replicability

**Can this work elsewhere?**

* YES for narrative-heavy games
* YES for specific, detailed settings
* YES for political/philosophical engagement

**Constraints needed:**

* Exceptional writing (thousands of lines)
* Commitment to specificity (not generic fantasy)
* Willingness to take political stance (can't be neutral)
* Patience for text-heavy gameplay

**Warning:** Requires resources of full studio. Not indie-solo viable at this scope.

***

## Part 6: Designer Choices and Tradeoffs

### Build vs. Suggest Decisions

**Built in Extreme Detail:**

* Martinaise (every building, every NPC)
* Political theory (all four quadrants deeply explored)
* Skill personalities (24 distinct voices)
* Historical layers (revolution, occupation, current struggle)
* Your character's brokenness (addiction, amnesia, trauma)

**Left for Player:**

* Your past (fragments you interpret)
* Your ideology (emerges, not chosen)
* Meaning of ending (what did this accomplish?)
* Your actual name (irrelevant, you're "detective")

**Why extremes:**

* Detail in setting creates immersion (Martinaise feels REAL)
* Detail in politics enables serious engagement
* Abstraction in past allows player projection
* Ambiguity in meaning respects player intelligence

### What Was NOT Built

**Deliberately excluded:**

* Combat system (would change game type)
* Other cities (focus on Martinaise)
* Character appearance customization (not relevant)
* Multiple cases (one case, deeply explored)
* "Good ending" option (tragedy is inevitable)

**Why not:**

* Combat: Distracts from detective/dialogue focus
* Other cities: Dilutes Martinaise's specificity
* Customization: Who you are internally matters, not looks
* Multiple cases: Depth over breadth
* Happy ending: Revachol's decline is the point

### Resource Allocation

**Where massive effort went:**

* Writing (over 1 million words)
* Voice acting (every line voiced)
* Art direction (oil painting aesthetic)
* Skill system design (24 unique personalities)
* Political theory research (serious ideological engagement)

**What was simple:**

* Mechanical complexity (mostly dice rolls)
* UI (functional, not elaborate)
* Animation (limited movement)
* Player character appearance (barely shown)

**Trade-off:** Narrative depth vs. mechanical complexity. Chose narrative.

***

## Part 7: LLM Implications

### What LLMs Could Enable

**For Disco-like games:**

* Dynamic skill commentary on situations
* Expanded NPC conversations maintaining tone
* More thought cabinet options
* Responsive political theory discussions

**Example:** LLM could generate Volition's voice commenting on new situations while maintaining its supportive, determined character.

### What LLMs Risk

**Critical threats:**

* Loss of ZA/UM's specific voice (irreplaceable writing style)
* Political neutrality (LLM might shy from strong stances)
* Inconsistent ideology (LLM doesn't track philosophical coherence well)
* Generic responses (not Martinaise-specific)
* Over-explanation (LLM tends to explain vs. imply)

### How This Game Informs LLM Design

**Lessons:**

**1. Voice Consistency is Paramount**

* Each skill has distinct voice
* LLM must maintain 24 different personalities
* Breaking character ruins immersion
* Training on existing skill dialogue crucial

**2. Context Constraints Must Be Strict**

* Every response must be Martinaise-aware
* Political theory must be internally consistent
* Historical references must align
* Cannot drift into generic fantasy city

**3. Ideology Tracking is Critical**

* LLM must remember player's political leanings
* Cannot contradict established beliefs
* Must allow inconsistency (humans are contradictory)
* Track thought cabinet contents, honor commitments

**Hybrid Approach:**

* Human-written core dialogues (main NPCs, critical scenes)
* LLM for skill commentary variations (extending existing voices)
* Strict ideological consistency checking
* Human review of political content (too important to fully automate)

***

## Part 8: Scenario Applications

### Scenario 1: Busy Adults Monthly Campaign

**Lesson:** External memory aid (thought cabinet equivalent)

* Disco tracks your ideology, investigations, relationships
* **Tool:** Persistent record of beliefs, relationships, goals
* **Application:** Give monthly players "political alignment" or "relationship map" they can review

### Scenario 2: Alien Cognition

**Lesson:** Skills as alien perspective

* Inland Empire isn't human rationality
* Shivers is supernatural connection to place
* **Tool:** Give alien characters non-human "skills"
* **Application:** Internal voices that reflect alien logic, not human

### Scenario 3: Mystery Investigation

**Lesson:** Context and case are inseparable

* Can't solve murder without understanding Martinaise
* Can't understand Martinaise without investigating murder
* **Tool:** Mystery embedded in setting
* **Application:** Investigation reveals world, world reveals motive

### Scenario 4: Subtle Powers

**Lesson:** Supernatural as natural (Shivers, Inland Empire)

* Shivers is genius loci (city speaks through you)
* Inland Empire is imagination/madness (not flashy magic)
* Esprit de Corps shows other cops' experiences
* **Tool:** Frame powers as senses or connections
* **Application:** Subtle powers that reveal information, not solve problems

### Scenario 6: Designer Ethics

**Lesson:** Politics require research and respect

* ZA/UM researched political theory seriously
* All ideologies treated with complexity (even when mocked)
* Doesn't shy from difficult topics
* **Warning:** Don't do political game without understanding politics
* **Tool:** Serious research, not surface treatment

***

## Part 9: Extractable Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Context as Primary System

**When to use:**

* Narrative-focused games
* Specific, detailed settings
* When theme is more important than mechanics

**How to implement:**

1. Design setting in extreme detail first
2. Derive mechanics from setting (not generic stats)
3. Ensure mechanics only work in this context
4. Make core gameplay about engaging with setting
5. Test: "Could this work in different setting?" If yes, revise.

**Example:** Shivers only works in Revachol. Physical Instrument reflects broken cop. Rhetoric matters because politics matters here.

**Warning:** Requires exceptional writing and worldbuilding. Cannot be procedural.

### Pattern 2: Skills as Personalities

**When to use:**

* Internal conflict themes
* Fragmented protagonist
* Complex decision-making

**How to implement:**

1. Define 4-8 core aspects of character
2. Give each distinct voice and perspective
3. Make them argue with player and each other
4. Allow contradictions (humans are inconsistent)
5. Use skill checks to surface internal debate

**Testing:** Do skills feel like characters? Can players quote them? If yes, success.

**Warning:** Easy to become confusing noise. Each voice must be distinct and purposeful.

### Pattern 3: Failure as Content

**When to use:**

* Character-focused narratives
* When "being bad at things" is valid character choice
* Discovery-driven gameplay

**How to implement:**

1. Design failure outcomes that advance story
2. Make failures reveal character
3. Ensure no dead ends from fails
4. Let players be incompetent and still progress
5. Make some failures more interesting than success

**Example:** Failing to punch Cuno leads to different scene that's just as valuable as succeeding.

**Warning:** Players conditioned to save-scum might miss failure content. Signal that failing is okay.

***

## Part 10: Quick Reference

**One-Sentence Lesson:**
Context can BE the system - when setting is specific and detailed enough, mechanics should derive from it rather than be generic RPG stats applied to it.

**Primary Tool:**
Context-as-Primary-System (design Martinaise first, create skills that only work there, embed case in political struggle, make mechanics serve setting).

**Best Used For:**

* Narrative and Expression aesthetics
* Political/philosophical games
* Detective/investigation
* Character-driven stories
* Specific, detailed settings (not generic)

**Warning:**
Requires extraordinary writing skill and massive time investment; cannot be done procedurally; needs commitment to political positions; text-heavy (not for everyone).

**Quote:**
"You're a detective LARPing in a CRPG. And you're cosplaying a broken man in a broken district in a broken world, but you're going to solve this case anyway." - Robert Kurvitz

**Example:**
Try to punch Cuno (Martinaise's foul-mouthed child). High Physical: Success, he mocks you for hitting a kid, Kim disapproves. Low Physical: Fail, hurt your hand, Cuno laughs, Kim is relieved. Both outcomes advance story AND reveal character. Neither is "correct." This is failure-as-content working perfectly.
