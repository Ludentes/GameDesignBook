# Context Analysis: Weather Factory Trilogy

## Cultist Simulator (2018), Book of Hours (2023), Exile (in development)

**Designer:** Alexis Kennedy (writer-first, designer-second)\
**Format:** Digital card game (card + verb + timer)\
**Primary Aesthetics:** Discovery, Narrative, Mastery (Cultist/Exile) / Submission, Discovery (Book of Hours)\
**Analysis Focus:** Success - same mechanics, different context = different experience

***

## Part 1: The Intended Experience

### Cultist Simulator

**What should players feel?**

* Forbidden knowledge acquisition (the thrill of discovering what you shouldn't know)
* Paranoia and isolation (occult research separates you from normal society)
* Dread mixed with fascination (Lovecraftian horror-curiosity)
* The weight of consequences (madness, cult leadership, ascension)

**What should players want to do?**

* Experiment with unknown systems (what happens if I combine these cards?)
* Decode cryptic clues (figure out the game's logic through trial and error)
* Pursue dark knowledge despite risks (the forbidden becomes compelling)
* Build toward transformation (becoming something other than human)

**What should players remember afterward?**

* The moment they first understood how a verb worked
* Discovering a new legacy/ending path
* The specific way their character went mad or ascended
* The feeling of "one more attempt to figure this out"

### Book of Hours

**What should players feel?**

* Tranquility and contemplation (restoring a library in the countryside)
* Pleasant discovery (finding books, helping visitors)
* Cozy productivity (organizing, cataloging, arranging)
* Gentle mastery (learning the Hours' mysteries without threat)

**What should players want to do?**

* Explore at own pace (no pressure to optimize)
* Restore and beautify (make the library whole again)
* Learn lore for its own sake (curiosity without consequences)
* Help visitors with their problems (gentle narrative engagement)

**What should players remember afterward?**

* The peaceful rhythm of library work
* Favorite books or discoveries
* The satisfaction of completing restorations
* Specific visitor stories they helped resolve

### Key Insight

**Same mechanics (card + verb + timer), completely opposite feelings.** This is pure context at work.

***

## Part 2: Context Design Choices

### What Context Was Built

**Cultist Simulator - Explicit:**

* Victorian/Edwardian occult setting (1920s-ish implied)
* You are jobless, desperate, learning forbidden arts
* The Hours (Lovecraftian entities) exist and can be contacted
* Society will notice and intervene if you're too obvious
* Death/madness/transformation are real outcomes

**Cultist Simulator - Suggested:**

* Specific history of your character (almost nothing given)
* Exact geography (generic city, deliberately vague)
* What the Hours actually are (mythology fragments only)
* Other cults and their activities (implied, rarely seen)
* The deeper cosmology (pieces that never quite complete)

**Book of Hours - Explicit:**

* You inherit Hush House, a remote library
* Previous librarian left mysteries behind
* Visitors come with requests and stories
* The Hours exist but are not threatening here
* You're restoring knowledge, not seeking power

**Book of Hours - Suggested:**

* Your character's past (hints in visitor interactions)
* Why the library fell into disrepair
* The full extent of what's in the collection
* Relationships between Hours (lore fragments)
* What happens after you finish (open-ended)

### Strategic Absence

**Both games leave deliberately vague:**

* Character appearance/gender (player projects)
* Exact historical period (timeless feel)
* Geographic specificity (universal applicability)
* Complete lore (mystery preserved even at "end")

**Why this works:** Specificity would constrain player imagination. The gaps are features, not bugs.

## Part 3: Context-Mechanic Relationship

### How Context Constrains Mechanics

**Cultist Simulator:**

* "Dread" makes sense in occult horror (wouldn't in cozy library)
* "Notoriety" matters because society opposes you
* "Reason/Passion/Health" depletion reflects mental/physical cost
* Timer pressure = paranoia (things decay while you work)
* Opaque systems = forbidden knowledge you must decode

**Book of Hours:**

* "Contentment" makes sense in restoration (not in horror)
* "Season" mechanic reflects rural library rhythm
* "Skills" develop through study, not danger
* Timer exists but no pressure (things wait for you)
* Transparent systems = accessible knowledge

### How Mechanics Support Context

**Same mechanic, different meaning:**

| Mechanic        | Cultist Simulator Context                | Book of Hours Context                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Cards           | Fragments of forbidden lore              | Books and visitors                      |
| Verbs           | Desperate actions (Study, Work, Explore) | Gentle activities (Read, Restore, Talk) |
| Timer           | Pressure and decay                       | Natural rhythm                          |
| Combining cards | Risky experimentation                    | Thoughtful research                     |
| Failure         | Death, madness, detection                | Mild setback, try again                 |

**The mechanics didn't change. The interpretation did.**

### The "Space Coffee" Test

**Can you reskin with different context?**

* NO. Cultist Simulator as "wizard academy" loses the isolation and paranoia
* NO. Book of Hours as "haunted library" loses the tranquility
* The context is load-bearing, not cosmetic

**What would break if you changed setting?**

* Cultist without occult = just a resource management game
* Book of Hours without cozy countryside = loses entire appeal
* The emotional experience depends on what the cards *mean*

***

## Part 4: Context-Aesthetic Coherence

### Cultist Simulator Success

**Discovery aesthetic:**

* Deliberately opaque systems require experimentation
* Cryptic card text forces interpretation
* Multiple legacy paths hide until discovered
* "Figure it out yourself" is the point

**Narrative aesthetic:**

* Every card has flavor text anchoring it in world
* Cult recruitment feels like building secret society
* Endings feel personally meaningful (you chose this path)

**Mastery aesthetic:**

* Learning optimal card combinations
* Understanding timer management
* Efficient cult-building strategies
* "Solved" game still feels atmospheric

### Book of Hours Success

**Submission aesthetic:**

* No fail states (can't die, can't lose)
* Generous timers (no pressure)
* Forgiving systems (mistakes are temporary)
* "Turn brain off and organize books" works

**Discovery aesthetic:**

* Pleasant surprises (new books, visitor stories)
* Lore reveals itself gradually
* No punishment for exploration
* Curiosity rewarded, never punished

### Coherence Analysis

**Everything points same direction:**

**Cultist Simulator:**

* Mechanics: Opaque, punishing, timer pressure
* Parameters: Scarcity, threat, decay
* Context: Forbidden knowledge, isolation, danger
* Pacing: Attrition (pressure builds until death/ascension)
* Result: Tension, paranoia, dark fascination

**Book of Hours:**

* Mechanics: Transparent, forgiving, gentle timers
* Parameters: Abundance, safety, restoration
* Context: Peaceful library, helpful visitors, growth
* Pacing: Episodic (complete tasks, move to next)
* Result: Tranquility, satisfaction, cozy exploration

**No contradictory signals.** Every element reinforces the aesthetic.

## Part 5: Designer Choices and Tradeoffs

### Kennedy's Writer-First Approach

**Cultist Simulator development:**

1. Started with tone: "Lovecraftian dread in card game"
2. Asked: What mechanics create that feeling?
3. Answer: Opacity, decay, timer pressure, irreversible choices
4. Tuned parameters to maximize paranoia
5. Wrote cards to deepen atmosphere

**Book of Hours development:**

1. Started with tone: "Cozy library restoration"
2. Asked: What mechanics create that feeling?
3. Answer: Same core (card/verb/timer) but opposite parameters
4. Removed threat, added abundance
5. Wrote cards to deepen tranquility

### Build vs. Suggest Decisions

**Built in detail:**

* Card flavor text (every card has personality)
* Hour mythology (fragments across hundreds of cards)
* Visitor personalities (distinct voices)
* Legacy/ending variety (multiple paths)

**Left abstract:**

* Character appearance (player imagination)
* Exact geography (universal setting)
* Complete cosmology (mystery preserved)
* "Correct" interpretation (ambiguity intended)

**Why these choices:**

* Detail where it creates atmosphere (card text)
* Abstraction where it enables projection (your character)
* Mystery where it maintains engagement (Hours' nature)

### What Was Cut/Simplified

**Deliberately did NOT build:**

* Visual character representation (just card art)
* Extensive tutorial (opacity is feature)
* Complete answers (questions remain)
* Geographic specificity (timeless quality)

**Why not:**

* Would reduce mystery (tutorial explains too much)
* Would constrain imagination (specific visuals limit)
* Would diminish replay (solved mysteries bore)
* Would lose universality (specific places date)

***

## Part 6: Dynamic vs. Static Context

### Fixed Elements

**What never changes:**

* Core mythology (the Hours, their aspects)
* Game logic (how verbs work)
* Legacy structures (paths to endings)
* Thematic coherence (tone stays consistent)

### Emergent Elements

**What players create:**

* Their character's story (through choices)
* Cult composition (which followers recruited)
* Interpretation of lore (ambiguity allows multiple readings)
* Personal meaning (what the experience meant to them)

### Exhaustibility

**Can you "run out" of context?**

* Card text is finite (hundreds of cards, still limited)
* Lore fragments are discoverable (completionists can find all)
* BUT: Ambiguity means interpretation is infinite
* AND: Multiple legacies create replay variety

**Replayability despite same context:**

* Different legacy paths feel different
* Random elements change each run
* Player knowledge changes experience (speedrunning vs. exploration)
* Mastery creates new appreciation (seeing the design)

***

## Part 7: LLM Implications

### What LLMs Could Enable

**For Cultist Simulator-like:**

* Dynamic card text that maintains tone
* Generated lore fragments that stay consistent
* Unique cult encounters each playthrough
* Endless mystery without exhausting content

**Risks:**

* Generic "occult" text (loses Kennedy's specific voice)
* Tone drift (accidentally becomes silly or too dark)
* Inconsistency (contradicts established lore)
* Loss of curated ambiguity (LLM over-explains)

### How to Preserve Kennedy's Success with LLM

**Must maintain:**

1. **Consistent voice** - Kennedy's specific prose style
2. **Deliberate opacity** - Don't over-explain
3. **Thematic coherence** - Every generation reinforces tone
4. **Curated ambiguity** - Some questions stay unanswered

**Approach:**

* Use Kennedy's card text as training examples
* Constrain generation to maintain mystery level
* Validate that tone matches (not just content)
* Preserve "holes" in lore (don't fill everything)

***

## Part 8: Scenario Applications

### Scenario 1: Busy Adults Monthly Campaign

**Lesson:** Episodic structure works (Book of Hours model)

* Each session = complete task (restore wing, help visitor)
* Long-term progress persists (library gradually restored)
* Low cognitive overhead (transparent systems)
* **Tool:** Design tasks with natural boundaries

### Scenario 2: Alien Cognition

**Lesson:** Opacity can create otherness (Cultist model)

* Don't explain alien thought patterns directly
* Let players decode through experimentation
* Maintain consistent internal logic (Hours have rules)
* **Tool:** Strategic ambiguity about motivations

### Scenario 3: Mystery Investigation

**Lesson:** Information management through card combinations

* Core clues = automatic discoveries
* Deeper understanding = combining clues (cards)
* Red herrings = cards that seem related but aren't
* **Tool:** Fragments that assemble into understanding

### Scenario 4: Subtle Powers

**Lesson:** Understated presentation (Book of Hours model)

* Powers as everyday tools, not flashy
* Consequences matter more than spectacle
* Context frames power as normal (Hours just exist)
* **Tool:** Matter-of-fact treatment of extraordinary

***

## Part 9: Extractable Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Same Mechanics, Different Context

**When to use:**

* Building multiple games from one system
* Creating genre variations
* Designing for different player energy states

**How to implement:**

1. Design core mechanics (card + verb + timer)
2. Identify what's adjustable (parameters, context, pacing)
3. Create opposite aesthetic goals (horror vs. cozy)
4. Tune parameters to serve each aesthetic
5. Write context that reinforces each feeling

**Warning:** Requires strong core mechanics that can support multiple tones.

### Pattern 2: Writer-First Design

**When to use:**

* When tone is more important than mechanics
* Creating narrative-heavy experiences
* Building atmospheric games

**How to implement:**

1. Start with desired feeling/tone
2. Ask what mechanics create that feeling
3. Choose simplest mechanics that work
4. Tune parameters for aesthetic
5. Write extensive flavor text

**Warning:** Requires strong writing skills, not just game design.

### Pattern 3: Strategic Opacity

**When to use:**

* Discovery aesthetic
* Mystery/investigation
* Mastery through understanding

**How to implement:**

1. Identify what players should decode
2. Provide cryptic clues, not tutorials
3. Maintain consistent internal logic
4. Reward experimentation
5. Preserve some permanent mystery

**Warning:** Frustrates players who want clear guidance.

## Part 10: Quick Reference

**One-Sentence Lesson:**
Context transforms the same mechanics into completely different experiences - Weather Factory proves tone is tunable through parameters and writing, not mechanics.

**Primary Tool:**
Same-Mechanics-Different-Context pattern (card + verb + timer serves both horror and cozy through parameter and context changes only).

**Best Used For:**

* Narrative and Discovery aesthetics
* Creating atmospheric experiences
* Building variations from one system
* Writer-driven design

**Warning:**
Requires exceptional writing to maintain tone across hundreds of cards; strategic opacity frustrates clarity-seeking players.

**Quote:**
"I'm a writer first, game designer second. The cards are sentences. The game is a story you tell yourself by combining sentences." - Alexis Kennedy

## Additional Note: FTL Comparison

Weather Factory chose **deep context** (extensive lore, atmospheric writing).

FTL chose **minimal context** (simple premise: deliver data, avoid rebels).

**Both succeeded** by being coherent:

* Weather Factory: Every card deepens world
* FTL: Simple context enables tactical focus

**FTL clones that failed:** Added lore/story that diluted tactical gameplay without adding meaningful narrative.

**Lesson:** Context depth must match aesthetic goal. More isn't always better.
