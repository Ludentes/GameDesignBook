# The "Space Coffee" Problem: When Context Is Cosmetic

## Origin and Definition

### The Term

"Space coffee" originates from science fiction writing criticism. It describes the lazy practice of taking contemporary objects/concepts and adding "space" as a prefix without meaningfully transforming them for the fictional setting.

**Examples in bad sci-fi:**

* Space coffee (coffee, but in space)
* Space elevator (elevator, but in space)
* Space bureaucracy (bureaucracy, but in space)
* Space capitalism (capitalism, but in space)

**Why it's lazy:** These additions don't engage with the setting. They're contemporary Earth concepts with "space" painted on. The setting is cosmetic, not transformative.

### Applied to Game Design

In game design, "space coffee" describes **context that's interchangeable without changing the experience.**

**The problem:** You've built detailed setting, lore, and worldbuilding, but none of it actually matters to gameplay or player experience. It's decoration on mechanics that would work identically anywhere.

**Examples:**

* Medieval fantasy card game → Sci-fi card game → Victorian detective card game
  * If only the art changed, it's space coffee
  * Same mechanics, same strategies, same experience
  * Context is cosmetic

**Not space coffee:**

* Weather Factory's Cultist Simulator → Book of Hours
  * Same mechanics (card + verb + timer)
  * Different context creates completely different experience
  * Context is load-bearing

## The Space Coffee Test

### How to Test Your Context

**The Question:**
"Could I reskin this game with completely different context without changing anything else?"

**If YES → You have space coffee** (context is cosmetic)\
**If NO → You have meaningful context** (context is load-bearing)

### Testing Methodology

**Step 1: Identify Core Mechanics**

* What are the actual actions players take?
* What systems drive gameplay?
* What creates the core loop?

**Step 2: Propose Alternative Context**

* Take same mechanics, different setting
* Medieval fantasy → Space opera
* Detective mystery → Fantasy quest
* Historical drama → Cyberpunk

**Step 3: Ask Critical Questions**

□ **Do mechanics still work identically?**

* Same strategies optimal?
* Same decisions meaningful?
* Same challenge level?

□ **Does player experience change?**

* Different feeling/atmosphere?
* Different meaning to actions?
* Different emotional response?

□ **Does context constrain mechanics?**

* Are certain actions impossible in new context?
* Do new actions become possible?
* Does internal logic shift?

**Step 4: Evaluate Results**

**PASS (meaningful context):**

* Mechanics break in different setting
* Experience fundamentally changes
* Context provides essential constraints
* Reskinning impossible without redesign

**FAIL (space coffee):**

* Mechanics work identically
* Only art/text changes
* Experience unchanged
* Context is just skin

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Poker (Space Coffee Alert)

**Original:** Poker with standard deck
**Reskin:** "Galactic Poker" with space-themed cards

* Hearts → Nebulas
* Diamonds → Stars
* Clubs → Black Holes
* Spades → Comets

**Space Coffee Test:**

* Do mechanics change? NO
* Does experience change? NO (still poker)
* Does context constrain? NO
* Optimal strategy? IDENTICAL

**Verdict:** Pure space coffee. Context is cosmetic decoration.

**Why it fails:** Poker's mechanics don't need or use the card suits' meaning. They're arbitrary symbols. Changing symbols changes nothing.

***

### Example 2: Blades in the Dark (NOT Space Coffee)

**Original:** Blades in the Dark (Victorian haunted city heists)
**Attempted reskin:** "Modern day corporate espionage"

**Space Coffee Test:**

* Do mechanics change? YES - many break
  * "Devil's Bargain" from literal devils/ghosts
  * "Attune" to ghosts doesn't translate
  * "Whisper" playbook loses coherence
  * Heat/Wanted system assumes corrupt watch, not modern police
  * Flashback mechanics assume Victorian investigation pace

* Does experience change? YES - completely different
  * Victorian → Modern loses gothic atmosphere
  * Ghosts → No ghosts loses supernatural horror
  * Street gangs → Corporate loses class struggle context

* Does context constrain? YES - deeply
  * Supernatural powers require supernatural world
  * Crew types assume Victorian underworld
  * Stress/trauma tied to occult horror
  * Score structures assume heist genre

**Verdict:** NOT space coffee. Context is load-bearing.

**Why it works:** Mechanics are designed FOR this specific setting. Changing setting requires redesigning mechanics. (Note: Scum & Villainy, the sci-fi hack, did extensive redesign, not just reskin.)

***

### Example 3: Cultist Simulator vs. Book of Hours (NOT Space Coffee)

**Test:** Can we reskin Cultist Simulator as Book of Hours?

**Same mechanics:**

* Card + verb + timer
* Combining cards
* Resource management

**Different context:**

* Cultist: Occult horror, forbidden knowledge, isolation
* Book of Hours: Cozy library, restoration, tranquility

**Space Coffee Test:**

* Do mechanics work identically? YES (technically same system)
* Does experience change? YES (completely opposite feelings)
* Does context constrain? YES (different cards, verbs, meanings)
* Same strategies? NO (horror needs caution, cozy encourages exploration)

**Verdict:** NOT space coffee, despite same mechanics!

**Why it works:** Context transforms mechanical meaning. "Draw card" means different things:

* Cultist: Dangerous knowledge (dread)
* Book of Hours: Pleasant discovery (contentment)

**The lesson:** Same mechanics + different context + different parameters = different experience. This is ANTI-space-coffee. Context creates the aesthetic.

***

### Example 4: Mass Effect: Andromeda (Space Coffee at Scale)

**Test:** Could Andromeda be reskinned as fantasy exploration?

**Original:** Sci-fi galaxy exploration, alien contact
**Reskin:** Fantasy continent exploration, new races

**Mechanics that translate directly:**

* Open world gathering → Same
* Combat → Sword/magic instead of guns/biotics
* Crafting → Same system
* Quest structure → Identical
* Outpost building → Village building
* Companion approval → Same
* Dialogue trees → Same

**Space Coffee Test:**

* Do mechanics change? NO - work identically
* Does experience change? NO - same gameplay loop
* Does context constrain? NO - mechanics work anywhere
* Optimal strategies? IDENTICAL

**Verdict:** Massive space coffee. Budget doesn't fix it.

**Why it fails:** Core gameplay loop (explore → gather → fight → quest → craft) doesn't need space setting. Could be fantasy, historical, underwater, anything. Context is expensive decoration on generic mechanics.

**The expensive mistake:** Andromeda spent huge budget on detailed sci-fi context (planets, aliens, lore), but none of it mattered to gameplay. All that context could be swapped without changing anything.

***

## Levels of Space Coffee

### Level 1: Pure Cosmetic (Worst)

**Definition:** Only art and text change, zero mechanical difference

**Example:** Poker with space cards, Monopoly with Star Wars properties

**Detection:**

* Swap assets in 5 minutes
* Game plays identically
* Players notice art change, nothing else

**Fix:** Don't bother fixing. Accept it's themeable game.

***

### Level 2: Shallow Integration (Common Problem)

**Definition:** Context affects flavor text and presentation, but not mechanics

**Example:**

* Medieval city builder vs. Space station builder
* Same mechanics (gather resources, build structures, manage population)
* Different art and descriptions
* Identical optimal strategies

**Detection:**

* Tutorial teaches same concepts
* Strategy guides transfer directly
* Players use same approaches
* Only aesthetics differ

**Fix:** Make context constrain mechanics. If medieval city has walls, make walls matter mechanically (sieges, defense). If space station has vacuum, make vacuum matter (airlocks, decompression).

***

### Level 3: Mechanical Flavor (Better But Still Shallow)

**Definition:** Context creates minor mechanical variations, but core system unchanged

**Example:**

* Fantasy RPG: Fireball spell
* Sci-fi RPG: Plasma grenade
* Same damage, same AOE, same cooldown
* Just different visual effect and name

**Detection:**

* Mechanics are stat variations on same template
* Different names for identical functions
* "Reflavoring" is accurate description
* Math is identical

**Fix:** Make context create unique mechanics. Fire spreads and lingers (environmental hazard). Plasma disrupts shields differently than kinetics. Context should create mechanical uniqueness, not just numerical tweaks.

***

### Level 4: Context Constrains Mechanics (Good)

**Definition:** Context determines what's possible mechanically

**Example:** Blades in the Dark

* Victorian setting → no cell phones (affects information gathering)
* Haunted city → ghosts are real (supernatural mechanics required)
* Corrupt watch → specific heat/wanted system
* Cannot reskin without redesigning

**Detection:**

* Changing context breaks mechanics
* Reskinning requires redesign
* Context creates opportunities AND limits
* Setting-specific mechanics exist

**Goal:** Reach this level minimum.

***

### Level 5: Context IS the System (Best)

**Definition:** Mechanics derive entirely from context, inseparable

**Example:** Disco Elysium

* Martinaise → Shivers skill (genius loci)
* Broken detective → 24 skill personalities
* Post-revolutionary → politics as mechanics
* Impossible to separate context from system

**Detection:**

* Cannot reskin at all
* Context generates mechanics
* Mechanics only make sense here
* Removing context destroys game

**Aspiration:** Aim for this when context is your primary design goal.

***

## Why Space Coffee Matters

### For Designers

**Wasted resources:**

* Building detailed lore that doesn't matter
* Creating art for interchangeable themes
* Writing context that players ignore
* Budget spent on decoration instead of experience

**Missed opportunities:**

* Context could constrain/enable unique mechanics
* Setting could create distinctive feel
* Lore could drive gameplay decisions
* World could be load-bearing, not cosmetic

**Player disappointment:**

* Promise rich world, deliver generic mechanics
* "Why does this matter?" question goes unanswered
* Setting feels arbitrary (because it is)
* Disconnection between world and gameplay

### For Players

**Generic feeling:**

* "I've played this before" (because you have, different skin)
* Unmemorable worlds (interchangeable settings)
* Disconnect between story and gameplay
* Sense that context is wasted potential

**Loss of immersion:**

* When mechanics don't fit context (breaks suspension of disbelief)
* When optimal strategy ignores setting (metagaming feels wrong)
* When context promises constraints that don't exist (lie by omission)

***

## How to Avoid Space Coffee

### Design Process

**1. Context-First Design (Recommended)**

* Start with specific world/setting
* Ask: "What mechanics make sense HERE?"
* Design mechanics that only work in this context
* Test: Could this work elsewhere? If yes, redesign.

**Example:** Disco Elysium started with Revachol (context), derived skills from setting

***

**2. Mechanics-First Design (Harder)**

* Start with mechanics
* Ask: "What context makes these mechanics meaningful?"
* Build world that justifies/constrains mechanics
* Test: Does context add constraint? If no, redesign context.

**Example:** Into the Breach (tactics game) → apocalyptic kaiju setting justifies turn-based, grid-based combat where positioning matters

***

**3. Aesthetic-First Design (Weather Factory Model)**

* Start with feeling/aesthetic
* Design context to deliver it
* Choose mechanics that serve context and aesthetic
* Tune parameters to reinforce
* Test: Does reskin change feeling? If no, context not doing enough.

**Example:** Weather Factory starts with "feel" (horror vs. cozy), builds context around it

***

### Validation Questions

Ask during design:

□ **Does context constrain what's possible?**

* Are certain actions impossible because of setting?
* Do setting rules create mechanical limits?

□ **Does context enable unique mechanics?**

* Are there mechanics that ONLY work here?
* Does setting create opportunities unavailable elsewhere?

□ **Does context create meaningful decisions?**

* Do players care about context when making choices?
* Does understanding world improve play?

□ **Does removing context break the game?**

* Could you play without knowing setting?
* Would it still make sense?

□ **Does context deliver aesthetic?**

* Is the feeling tied to world?
* Would different context create different aesthetic?

**Scoring:**

* 5 YES answers → Strong context (not space coffee)
* 3-4 YES → Moderate integration (could improve)
* 1-2 YES → Weak integration (approaching space coffee)
* 0 YES → Pure space coffee (context is decoration)

***

## Special Cases and Nuances

### When Space Coffee Is Okay

**Themed versions of abstract games:**

* Chess but with different piece designs (fine)
* Card games with various art styles (expected)
* Abstract strategy games (context optional)

**Why it's okay:** Players understand context is cosmetic. No pretense of integration. Honest about being themed version.

**Not okay:** Marketing game as "rich world" when it's just themed abstract game. That's dishonest.

***

### When Mechanics-First Is Fine

**Puzzle games:**

* Tetris doesn't need context
* Portal uses context well but mechanics work without
* Baba Is You is abstract

**Why it's fine:** Mechanics are the point. Context enhances but isn't load-bearing. Players know this.

**When it becomes problem:** If you build elaborate world for puzzle game, it better matter. Otherwise, wasted effort (and space coffee if world doesn't constrain puzzles).

***

### The Hybrid Approach

**Some elements load-bearing, some cosmetic:**

**Example:** XCOM 2

* Strategic layer: Alien occupation constrains mechanics (load-bearing)
  * Resource scarcity from being rebels
  * Timed missions from alien dark events
  * Stealth mechanics from being outnumbered
  * Base building limitations from hiding

* Tactical layer: Somewhat space coffee
  * Cover system works in any setting
  * Abilities are sci-fi flavored but generic tactics
  * Could reskin as fantasy/modern/historical

**Verdict:** Partial space coffee, acceptable because strategic context is strong

**Lesson:** Not all-or-nothing. Evaluate each system separately.

***

## Advanced: The "Could This Be a Mod?" Test

**Additional validation:**

**The question:** "If this was a mod for another game, would anything be lost?"

**Example 1: Vampire Survivors**

* Could be mod for any survivors-like
* Mechanics are generic (shoot, level up, survive)
* Context is cosmetic (Castlevania aesthetic)
* **But that's fine** - it's honest about being mechanics-first

**Example 2: Disco Elysium**

* Could NOT be mod for another RPG
* Mechanics are unique to this world
* Removing Martinaise destroys the game
* **Proper integration** - context is essential

**Use this test when:**

* Evaluating if your game has unique identity
* Deciding if context matters enough
* Checking if you've built a genre game with paint job vs. something unique

***

## Summary: The Space Coffee Framework

### Definition

Context is "space coffee" when it's interchangeable without changing player experience.

### Test

Could you reskin this game completely without changing mechanics, strategies, or player experience? If yes → space coffee.

### Why It Matters

* Wastes design resources on irrelevant detail
* Creates generic, forgettable experiences
* Misses opportunities for meaningful integration
* Disappoints players expecting rich world to matter

### How to Avoid

1. **Context-first design** - build mechanics from setting
2. **Constraint-checking** - does context limit mechanics?
3. **Uniqueness test** - are there mechanics ONLY possible here?
4. **Aesthetic validation** - does context create the feeling?
5. **Removal test** - does removing context break the game?

### Levels

1. Pure cosmetic (worst)
2. Shallow integration
3. Mechanical flavor
4. Context constrains mechanics (good)
5. Context IS the system (best)

### Goal

Reach level 4-5 when context matters to your design. Accept 1-2 for abstract games where context is optional.

**Remember:** Space coffee isn't about effort or detail. Andromeda proves you can spend millions on detailed context and still have space coffee. It's about integration, constraint, and meaningful connection between world and mechanics.

**The core insight:** Context should change what's possible, what's optimal, what's meaningful. If it only changes what things look like, it's space coffee.
