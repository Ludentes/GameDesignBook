# Part 10: Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

## Introduction

You've learned the framework. Now learn what breaks it.

This section catalogs the most common failures in context design, drawn from shipped games, abandoned projects, and systematic analysis. Each pitfall includes:

* **Symptom:** How to recognize it
* **Why it happens:** Root cause
* **Result:** What goes wrong
* **Fix:** How to correct it
* **Example:** Real or illustrative case

**Use this as:**

* Diagnostic tool (something feels wrong, which pitfall is it?)
* Prevention checklist (am I making these mistakes?)
* Learning from failures (why did this game fail?)

***

## Pitfall 1: Starting with "Cool Setting" Instead of Aesthetic

### Symptom

* Designer has detailed world/lore before aesthetic goals
* "I want to make a game about X setting" instead of "I want players to feel Y"
* Extensive worldbuilding without clear experiential purpose

### Why It Happens

* Worldbuilding is fun and creative
* Settings are concrete, aesthetics are abstract
* Many designers are writers first, game designers second
* "Setting-first" is how many people think about games

### Result

**Space coffee:** Detailed setting that doesn't affect gameplay

The setting exists but doesn't serve an experience. Andromeda had extensive lore about alien species, galaxy exploration, colonization efforts—none of it mattered to the gameplay loop. Could have been fantasy exploration with identical mechanics.

### The Fix

**1. Start with aesthetic, always**

* Not "I want cyberpunk setting"
* But "I want Discovery aesthetic, cyberpunk might serve it"

**2. Validate setting serves aesthetic**

* Ask: "Does this setting naturally create my intended experience?"
* If no clear answer → Wrong order

**3. Be willing to change setting**

* If aesthetic needs horror but you have cozy pastoral → Change one
* Setting serves aesthetic, not vice versa

**4. Apply decision tree from Part 2**

* Aesthetic → Genre → Dressing
* This order prevents cool-setting trap

### Example: The Saved Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"I want to make a game about Victorian ghost hunters. They have gadgets that detect spirits, there's a society of hunters, complex lore about ghost taxonomy..."

**Problem:** No aesthetic goal. Just setting.

**Fixed approach (right):**
"I want Discovery aesthetic (investigating mysteries). Victorian ghost hunting serves this because:

* Paranormal investigation = mystery solving
* Limited technology = must use deduction not sensors
* Society of hunters = shared knowledge to discover
  Setting now serves Discovery aesthetic."

**Result:** Same setting, but now purposeful. Build/Suggest/Omit decisions flow from Discovery needs.

***

## Pitfall 2: Confusing Genre and Dressing

### Symptom

* "We're making a Star Wars game" (what genre though?)
* Can't articulate what experience you're creating
* Unclear what mechanics to build
* Team debates about "what Star Wars means"

### Why It Happens

* Pop culture references use IP names, not genre names
* "Star Wars" feels more concrete than "space fantasy hero's journey"
* Dressing is visible, genre is structural (harder to see)
* Licensed games forced to use IP, mistake it for design direction

### Result

**Unclear design direction:** Team builds different genres simultaneously

Without separating genre from dressing, different designers build toward different experiences. One person builds hero's journey mechanics, another builds tactical combat, third builds exploration. Result: Incoherent mess.

### The Fix

**1. Identify the actual genre**

* Not "Star Wars" but "Which Star Wars?"
  * Original trilogy: Fantasy hero's journey
  * Rogue One: War movie
  * Andor: Political thriller
* All Star Wars, completely different genres

**2. Use the genre-dressing separation test**

* Can you describe the genre without mentioning dressing?
* "Political thriller about rebellion against authoritarian regime" ✓
* "Star Wars game" ✗ (dressing, not genre)

**3. Design for genre first, apply dressing second**

* Political thriller needs: Information gathering, social maneuvering, consequence tracking
* Star Wars dressing adds: Empire as regime, Rebellion as underground, specific tech aesthetic
* Genre determines mechanics, dressing determines flavor

**4. Test with reskin thought experiment**

* Could this be different dressing with same genre? If yes, genre is load-bearing ✓
* Would different genre same dressing break it? If yes, genre matters more than dressing ✓

### Example: The Clarified Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"We're making a Star Wars game where you play as a smuggler."

**Problem:** Dressing (Star Wars, smuggler) without genre. What experience? What mechanics?

**Fixed approach (right):**
"We're making a heist game (genre) with consequence management where you plan scores and deal with heat. Star Wars dressing means: Empire as law, criminal underworld, hyperspace for getaways."

**Now clear:**

* Genre: Heist → Need flashback mechanics, score structure, heat tracking
* Dressing: Star Wars → Empire patrols, bounty hunters, cantinas
* Mechanics flow from genre
* Dressing reinforces without determining

***

## Pitfall 3: Breaking Perspective for "Realism"

### Symptom

* "But aliens WOULD fail at ladders realistically!"
* "Wouldn't the detective need to eat/sleep/pay rent?"
* "Historically, women couldn't vote, so..."
* Defending elements that break aesthetic because they're "realistic"

### Why It Happens

* Designers value verisimilitude
* "Realism" feels like quality
* Hard to distinguish "realistic" from "serves aesthetic"
* Defensive about criticism ("but it's accurate!")

### Result

**Perspective breaks:** Horror becomes comedy, mystery becomes life sim, focus dilutes

The alien pratfall might be realistic (creatures aren't perfect) but it breaks horror. Detective paying rent might be realistic but it dilutes mystery investigation. Historical accuracy might justify exclusion but breaks intended player experience.

**Perspective serves aesthetic. Realism serves perspective. Not vice versa.**

### The Fix

**1. Establish perspective as non-negotiable**

* Horror: "Unknowable threat" is law
* Mystery: "Solvable puzzle" is law
* Cozy: "Safe comfort" is law
* Realism serves these, not vice versa

**2. Apply the perspective filter**

* Does this element serve perspective? Keep it (even if unrealistic)
* Does it break perspective? Cut it (even if realistic)
* "But it's realistic!" is never sufficient justification

**3. Find realistic ways to serve perspective**

* Horror: Alien CAN fail, but frame it as "learning, adapting" (threat increases) not comedy
* Mystery: Detective DOES need food, but abstract it (stamina resource) not simulate it
* Historical: Can acknowledge constraints without making them core mechanics

**4. Remember: This is a game, not documentary**

* Players chose to play, not to experience perfect realism
* Aesthetic goal > verisimilitude
* Serve experience, not accuracy

### Example: The Corrected Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"In our horror game, the alien will sometimes fail at tasks to show it's not all-powerful. It'll struggle with doors, fall down occasionally, get confused by human technology. This is realistic—it's an alien, not omniscient."

**Problem:** Every "failure" makes alien less threatening. Horror becomes slapstick. "Realistic" breaks perspective.

**Fixed approach (right):**
"Alien is extremely dangerous and adaptive. When it encounters obstacles, it learns from them. First time it meets a locked door, it might investigate briefly (tension: players hear it trying). Next time, it knows doors open and how to manipulate them (threat escalates). Frames failure as learning, not comedy. Maintains unknowable threat perspective."

**Realistic AND maintains horror.**

***

## Pitfall 4: Over-Explaining Mysteries

### Symptom

* Detailed codex entries for everything
* Every question answered explicitly
* Complete backstory for minor elements
* Fear that players might not understand

### Why It Happens

* Designers love their worldbuilding
* Fear of player confusion
* "More content is better" mentality
* Hard work on lore wants to be shown

### Result

**Discovery aesthetic fails:** Nothing left to imagine or investigate

Outer Wilds works because some mysteries stay mysterious. Weather Factory works because cosmology remains fragmented. Over-explanation kills the joy of discovery and removes imagination space.

### The Fix

**1. Trust Suggest and Omit**

* Not everything needs complete explanation
* Fragments can be more engaging than complete answers
* Mystery creates engagement

**2. Apply aesthetic-specific ratios**

* Discovery aesthetic: HIGH Suggest (investigation is the game)
* Horror aesthetic: HIGH Omit (unknown creates fear)
* Challenge aesthetic: HIGH Build (clarity needed)
* Match explanation level to aesthetic

**3. Test the "remaining questions" metric**
After players finish, ask: "What are you still curious about?"

* If nothing → Over-explained
* If fundamentals → Under-explained
* If interesting mysteries → Just right

**4. Remember Weather Factory's restraint**

* Cultist Simulator: Complete cosmology never explained
* Book of Hours: Why library fell apart stays fragmentary
* Players LOVE theorizing about these mysteries
* Over-explanation would kill engagement

### Example: The Restrained Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"Players will find a complete codex explaining: Alien species biology (14 pages), lifecycle (8 pages), home world ecosystem (12 pages), language structure (6 pages), cultural practices (20 pages), religious beliefs (15 pages), technology (18 pages)."

**Problem:** Discovery becomes reading. Unknowable becomes encyclopedia. Horror dies under explanation.

**Fixed approach (right):**
"Players find fragments: Partial log about 'silicon-based metabolism concerns,' broken recording mentioning 'hive communication,' evidence of acid-based defense. Enough to understand immediate threats (don't get hit by acid). Not enough to reduce alien to 'just an animal.' Maintain horror through selective information."

**Players theorize. Some mysteries preserved.**

***

## Pitfall 5: Under-Building Core Facts

### Symptom

* Players confused about basic mechanics
* "What am I supposed to do?" is common question
* Mystery becomes frustration not engagement
* Artistic vagueness taken too far

### Why It Happens

* Over-correction from Pitfall 4 (over-explaining)
* "Let players discover" taken to extreme
* Confusing "mystery" with "unclear goals"
* Valuing artistic ambiguity over playability

### Result

**Players stall:** Can't make decisions without fundamental information

Suggest and Omit are powerful tools. But players need basic facts to play. If core mechanics are mysterious, core goals are unclear, or basic world rules are hidden, players can't engage meaningfully.

**Build the foundations. Suggest the details. Omit the mysteries.**

### The Fix

**1. Identify "need to know" information**

* What's required to make first decision?
* What's required to understand success/failure?
* What's required to not feel lost?
* BUILD these, always

**2. Apply the "30-minute test"**
After 30 minutes of play, players should understand:

* What they're trying to accomplish (goal)
* How to interact with the game (mechanics)
* What success/failure looks like (stakes)
  If any of these unclear → Under-built

**3. Distinguish productive vs obstructive mystery**

* Productive: "What's behind this locked door?" (can investigate)
* Obstructive: "How do I open doors?" (can't progress without knowing)
* Build obstructive answers, Suggest productive mysteries

**4. Remember Gumshoe principle**

* Core clues: Automatic (Build)
* Optional depth: Gated (Suggest)
* Mystery isn't "will you find clues" but "what they mean"

### Example: The Clarified Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"Players wake up in mysterious facility. No explanation of controls, goals, or mechanics. Everything is discovered through experimentation. Very artistic and mysterious."

**Problem:** Players don't know how to play. Stuck at start. Frustration not engagement.

**Fixed approach (right):**
"Players wake up in mysterious facility. Tutorial teaches: Controls (how to move, interact), immediate goal (escape this room), basic mechanic (find keycards for doors). THESE are clear (Build).

What's mysterious (Suggest/Omit): Why you're here, what the facility is, who captured you, what's beyond doors. Investigation reveals fragments. Some questions never fully answered.

Players can play immediately. Mystery is narrative, not mechanical."

**Playable AND mysterious.**

***

## Pitfall 6: Incoherent Aesthetic Signals

### Symptom

* Cozy game with sudden violence
* Mystery game with random solutions
* Horror game with power fantasy moments
* Players confused about what game wants

### Why It Happens

* "Variety" mistaken for "good"
* Different designers want different things
* Copying mechanics from games with different aesthetics
* No coherence validation

### Result

**Players don't know what to optimize for:** Game sends contradictory signals

When game is sometimes cozy and sometimes tense, players don't know how to approach it. When mystery is sometimes solvable and sometimes random, deduction feels pointless. When horror creature is sometimes threatening and sometimes joke, fear disappears.

**Everything must point same direction.**

### The Fix

**1. Define primary aesthetic and enforce it**

* Primary aesthetic is law
* Secondary aesthetics support, never contradict
* Test every element: "Does this serve primary aesthetic?"

**2. Use coherence checklist from Part 8**

* Genre serves aesthetic ✓
* Dressing reinforces genre ✓
* Perspective maintained ✓
* Resources match context ✓
* Balance paradigm fits ✓
* Cognitive load appropriate ✓
* Dynamics aligned ✓

**3. Cut contradictory elements ruthlessly**

* That cool boss fight in your cozy game? Cut it.
* That random plot twist in your deduction mystery? Cut it.
* That comedy relief in your horror? Cut it.
* "But it's cool!" isn't justification if it breaks coherence

**4. When in doubt, refer to Weather Factory**

* Cultist Simulator: Every element serves horror
* Book of Hours: Every element serves cozy
* No exceptions, no compromises
* Perfect coherence possible

### Example: The Focused Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"Cozy farming game where you grow crops, befriend villagers, and occasionally defend against monster attacks. Combat is intense tactical grid-based encounters with permadeath."

**Problem:** Cozy (relaxing) contradicts intense tactical combat. Submission aesthetic contradicts Challenge aesthetic. Incoherent.

**Fixed approach (right):**

**Option A (Stay Cozy):**
"Cozy farming game where you grow crops and befriend villagers. When rare pests appear, you use simple, forgiving mechanics to shoo them away (couple clicks, can't lose, charming animation). Maintains Submission aesthetic throughout."

**Option B (Embrace Challenge):**
"Strategic farming defense where you cultivate crops AND prepare defenses against monster waves. Combat is integral, tactical, challenging. Don't call it cozy—it's tower defense farming. Challenge aesthetic throughout."

**Pick one aesthetic. Commit.**

***

## Pitfall 7: Ignoring Constraints

### Symptom

* Chose genre that needs 4-hour sessions, have 2 hours
* Chose genre requiring 5+ players, have 3
* Chose real-time genre, players want turn-based
* Genre perfect except for actual constraints

### Why It Happens

* Fall in love with genre before checking constraints
* Assume constraints can be overcome ("we'll make it work")
* Skip constraint filtering in decision tree
* Confuse "what I want to design" with "what's actually feasible"

### Result

**Genre can't work in available format:** Square peg, round hole

Long tactical combat doesn't fit 2-hour monthly sessions. Tactical RPG depth doesn't fit mobile phone controls. Coordination-heavy cooperative doesn't fit 2-player couples. Genre needs what constraints can't provide.

### The Fix

**1. Apply constraints EARLY in decision tree**

* Time available per session (affects genre choice)
* Player count (affects social mechanics)
* Format (tabletop vs digital affects complexity)
* Cognitive load budget (affects depth)

**2. Be honest about non-negotiable constraints**

* "Monthly 2-hour sessions" is real and fixed
* "3 players available" is real and fixed
* "Must work on mobile" is real and fixed
* Don't pretend you can overcome these

**3. Choose genre that works within constraints**

* Not "best genre for aesthetic" but "best genre for aesthetic THAT FITS CONSTRAINTS"
* Decision tree in Part 2 includes constraint filtering for this reason

**4. When genre doesn't fit, change genre not constraints**

* If tactical RPG doesn't fit 2 hours → Choose different genre
* If 5-player social deduction doesn't fit 3 players → Choose different genre
* If real-time doesn't fit your audience → Choose turn-based
* Constraints are reality, genre is choice

### Example: The Adapted Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"We want to play D\&D but only have 2 hours per month. We'll just speed up combat somehow."

**Problem:** Tactical D\&D combat IS the point. Speeding it up breaks it. Genre doesn't fit constraint.

**Fixed approach (right):**

**Option A (Change genre):**
"We want fantasy adventure but have 2 hours monthly. Use Blades in the Dark (heist structure, scores are 2-hour episodes). Genre fits constraint. Different from D\&D but works."

**Option B (Accept constraint limits):**
"We'll play D\&D but accept we can only do one combat encounter per session, or pure roleplay sessions. Adjust expectations. Maybe run West Marches style (drop-in, mission-based)."

**Option C (Change constraint if possible):**
"Can we meet weekly instead of monthly? Can we do 4 hours instead of 2?"

**Pick option that's actually feasible.**

***

## Pitfall 8: Treating Dressing as Load-Bearing

### Symptom

* "This MUST be space-themed, can't be fantasy"
* "The story only works in Victorian London"
* "We need this specific IP or it doesn't work"
* Unable to articulate why dressing is essential

### Why It Happens

* Attachment to specific setting/IP
* Personal passion for particular aesthetic
* Confusing personal preference with design necessity
* Never tested if dressing is actually load-bearing

### Result

**Locked into unnecessary constraints:** Dressing blocks better design choices

Sometimes dressing truly is load-bearing (Disco Elysium's Martinaise matters structurally). Usually it's not (heist games work in any era). Treating cosmetic dressing as essential prevents finding better options or licensing alternatives.

### The Fix

**1. Apply the reskin test**

* Could you change dressing without changing genre/mechanics?
* If YES → Dressing is cosmetic (not load-bearing)
* If NO → Dressing is load-bearing (or you haven't separated genre from dressing yet)

**2. Distinguish "I want this" from "design needs this"**

* "I want space setting" (preference) ≠ "design requires space setting" (necessity)
* Preferences are fine but acknowledge them as such
* Don't confuse preference with structural requirement

**3. Test with concrete alternatives**

* "This heist game is set in space" → Could it be medieval fantasy heists? Cyberpunk heists? Historical heists?
* If YES without changing mechanics → Dressing is cosmetic
* Choose dressing you prefer, but know you're choosing

**4. Reserve "load-bearing" for genuine cases**

* Disco Elysium: Martinaise IS the game (can't reskin without rebuilding)
* Outer Wilds: Solar system structure IS the game (orbital mechanics matter)
* Most games: Dressing is cosmetic (could reskin)

### Example: The Freed Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"This game about investigation and deduction MUST be Victorian London. Sherlock Holmes aesthetic is essential. Won't work any other way."

**Reskin test:** Could this be:

* Modern forensic investigation? (Yes, same mechanics)
* Fantasy magic investigation? (Yes, same mechanics)
* Space station mystery? (Yes, same mechanics)
* Historical ancient Rome? (Yes, same mechanics)

**Realization:** Victorian London is dressing preference, not structural necessity. Investigation mechanics are genre (load-bearing). Victorian is cosmetic.

**Result:** Designer can:

* Keep Victorian London if preferred ✓
* Consider alternatives if better fit ✓
* Seek licensing deals knowing dressing is flexible ✓
* Not locked into one setting ✓

**Freedom through clarity.**

***

## Pitfall 9: LLM Over-Explanation (Future Problem)

### Symptom

* LLM reveals mysteries that should stay mysterious
* Complete explanations generated when fragments better
* Strategic Omit decisions undermined by helpful AI
* Suggest becomes Build through over-generation

### Why It Happens

* LLMs want to be helpful (answer completely)
* Default behavior is comprehensive response
* Hard to constrain to maintain mystery
* Designers don't prompt for restraint

### Result

**Breaks Build/Suggest/Omit framework:** Mystery dies, horror becomes explained, discovery becomes handed-to-you

When LLM answers "What does the alien look like?" with detailed description, your horror Omit decision is broken. When LLM explains complete backstory instead of fragments, your Discovery Suggest decision is violated.

### The Fix

**Note:** This is flagged for future detailed LLM integration chapter. Brief guidance here:

**1. Prompt for restraint explicitly**

* "Maintain mystery, never fully explain"
* "Provide fragments only, not complete answers"
* "When asked about X, give glimpses not full descriptions"

**2. Build perspective into system message**

* "This is horror. The threat must remain unknowable."
* "This is mystery. Players must deduce, not be told."
* System message enforces Build/Suggest/Omit decisions

**3. Validate LLM maintains decisions**

* Test: Ask about mystery element, check if over-explained
* If LLM reveals too much → Refine prompts
* Ensure Omit stays omitted, Suggest stays fragmentary

**4. Human validation layer**

* Don't let LLM responses go directly to players without review (in critical cases)
* Check that mysteries stay mysterious
* Maintain perspective manually if needed

**Full details in future LLM Integration chapter.**

***

## Pitfall 10: No Integration with Other Systems

### Symptom

* Context feels bolted-on
* Setting doesn't explain mechanics
* Resources don't make narrative sense
* Balance paradigm contradicts genre
* Everything works but nothing connects

### Why It Happens

* Context designed separately from mechanics
* Chapters of book read out of order
* Different team members not communicating
* Each system designed in isolation

### Result

**Mechanical but soulless:** Everything functions, nothing feels coherent

Mass Effect Andromeda technically worked. Context existed. Mechanics existed. But context didn't affect mechanics, resources didn't emerge from context, balance didn't serve genre. Separate systems, not integrated design.

### The Fix

**1. Use integration checklist from Part 8**

* Context → Resources: Do resources make sense in world?
* Context → Balance: Does paradigm fit genre?
* Context → Cognitive Load: Does load match aesthetic?
* Context → Dynamics: Do expected behaviors emerge?

**2. Design in sequence, not parallel**

* Aesthetic → Genre → Context (this chapter)
* THEN Resources (Chapter 2, informed by context)
* THEN Balance (Chapter 4, informed by genre)
* Each informs next, not separate tracks

**3. Validate integration points**

* Can you explain why each resource exists in narrative?
* Does balance paradigm match genre needs?
* Does cognitive load serve aesthetic?
* Cross-reference constantly

**4. Use Weather Factory as model**

* Horror context → Horror resources (Dread, Stress)
* Horror aesthetic → Appropriate cognitive load
* Horror genre → Appropriate parameters
* Perfect integration

### Example: The Integrated Design

**Initial approach (wrong):**
"We're making a survival game. Context team designs alien planet setting. Mechanics team designs resource management. Balance team designs difficulty curves. Each team works separately."

**Result:** Planet lore mentions abundant water. Mechanics make water extremely scarce. Balance makes survival trivially easy. Nothing connects.

**Fixed approach (right):**

**Sequential integration:**

1. Aesthetic: Tension (survival pressure)
2. Genre: Survival against environment
3. Context: Harsh alien planet (explains scarcity)
4. Resources: Water scarce (matches harsh environment), Oxygen limited (alien atmosphere), Suit integrity (environmental damage)
5. Balance: Consistency paradigm (learnable survival patterns)
6. Cognitive Load: Medium (tracking resources creates tension without overwhelming)

**Every decision informs next. Everything connects.**

* Resources make narrative sense ✓
* Balance fits genre ✓
* Load serves aesthetic ✓
* Context explains everything ✓

**Integrated, not bolted together.**

## How to Use This Section

### As Prevention Checklist

**Before finalizing design, check:**
□ Started with aesthetic not setting
□ Separated genre from dressing
□ Perspective maintained throughout
□ Appropriate Build/Suggest/Omit ratios
□ Core facts built, mysteries preserved
□ Coherent aesthetic signals
□ Constraints applied early
□ Dressing not treated as structural
□ LLM constrained appropriately
□ Integration validated

**If any unchecked → Address before shipping**

### As Diagnostic Tool

**Something feels wrong, but what?**

Symptoms guide you to pitfall:

* Setting detailed but doesn't matter → Pitfall 1
* Unclear what to build → Pitfall 2
* Comedy breaks horror → Pitfall 3
* Nothing left to discover → Pitfall 4
* Players confused → Pitfall 5
* Mixed signals → Pitfall 6
* Genre doesn't fit → Pitfall 7
* "Must be this setting" → Pitfall 8
* Mysteries revealed → Pitfall 9
* Nothing connects → Pitfall 10

### As Learning Tool

**Study failures:**

* Andromeda: Pitfalls 1, 6, 10 (cool setting, incoherent, disconnected)
* D\&D 4e: Pitfalls 6, 10 (incoherent signals, mechanical focus without integration)
* Generic space coffee: Pitfall 1 (setting without purpose)

**Study successes:**

* Weather Factory: Avoided all pitfalls (perfect coherence)
* Outer Wilds: Avoided Pitfall 4 (maintained mysteries)
* Disco Elysium: Avoided Pitfall 8 (dressing IS load-bearing, correctly)

***

## The Meta-Pattern

**All pitfalls share root cause: Forgetting that context serves aesthetic.**

When you remember this:

* Setting serves experience (not vice versa)
* Genre determines structure (dressing is flavor)
* Perspective is non-negotiable (realism serves it)
* Mystery has purpose (over/under-explaining both bad)
* Coherence is required (everything aligns)
* Constraints are real (genre must fit)
* Integration matters (everything connects)

**The solution is always: Return to aesthetic goal.**

Does this serve aesthetic?

* Yes → Keep it
* No → Change or cut it
* Unsure → Test it

**That's the framework. These are the ways to break it. Don't break it.**

***

## Final Advice

**You will make some of these mistakes.** Everyone does. The goal isn't perfection on first attempt—it's:

1. Recognizing mistakes when they happen
2. Diagnosing which pitfall
3. Applying the fix systematically
4. Iterating until coherent

**Use this section as:**

* Prevention (checklist before shipping)
* Diagnosis (when something feels wrong)
* Fix (systematic correction)
* Learning (understanding failures)

**Remember Weather Factory:** Perfect coherence is possible. These pitfalls are avoidable. Context can serve aesthetic flawlessly.
