# Part 1: Introduction - Why Context Matters

## The Space Coffee Problem

There is a persistent issue in lazy sci-fi worldbuilding we call "space coffee." The term describes a practice where writers take contemporary Earth objects or concepts and simply add "space" as a prefix without meaningfully transforming them for the fictional setting.

Space coffee. Space elevators. Space bureaucracy. Space capitalism.

These aren't adaptations of familiar concepts to a new reality—they're contemporary Earth with "space" painted on. The setting is cosmetic, not transformative.

Game designers have the exact same problem.

**The $60 million question:** Does your setting actually matter?

***

## When Context Is Just Paint

Mass Effect: Andromeda cost approximately $100 million to develop. It featured:

* Multiple detailed alien planets with unique biomes
* Several alien species with extensive backstories
* Hundreds of codex entries explaining technology and culture
* Carefully crafted lore about exploration and survival
* A massive galaxy to explore

**And none of it mattered.**

Players could have replaced "alien planet exploration" with "fantasy continent exploration" without changing a single gameplay system. The gather-resources loop, the combat encounters, the quest structures, the companion mechanics—all of it worked identically regardless of the sci-fi dressing.

The setting was space coffee. Expensive, detailed, beautiful space coffee.

## When Context Actually Matters

**Consider Weather Factory's two games:**

**Cultist Simulator (2018):**

* Mechanics: Card + verb + timer
* Context: Occult horror, forbidden knowledge, isolation
* Feeling: Paranoid, tense, dread-filled

**Book of Hours (2023):**

* Mechanics: Card + verb + timer (identical system)
* Context: Cozy library restoration, peaceful countryside
* Feeling: Tranquil, meditative, pleasant

**Same mechanics. Completely opposite experiences.**

The context isn't decoration—it transforms how the mechanics feel. Drawing a card in Cultist Simulator creates dread (what forbidden knowledge will corrupt me?). Drawing a card in Book of Hours creates contentment (what pleasant book will I discover?).

**This is context done right.**

## The Genre vs Dressing Distinction

Here's what makes understanding context tricky: **the setting everyone talks about often isn't what actually matters.**

Consider Star Wars:

**Star Wars (1977):** Fantasy hero's journey that happens to be in space

* Genre: Campbell's monomyth, coming-of-age adventure
* Mechanics needed: Mentor relationship, power growth, moral choices, destiny
* Dressing: Space opera aesthetics

**Rogue One (2016):** War movie that happens to be in Star Wars universe

* Genre: Suicide mission, ensemble cast, gritty combat
* Mechanics needed: Squad tactics, high lethality, resource scarcity, mission focus
* Dressing: Star Wars aesthetics

**Andor (2022):** Political thriller that happens to be in Star Wars universe

* Genre: Espionage, manipulation, systemic corruption
* Mechanics needed: Information gathering, social maneuvering, consequence tracking
* Dressing: Star Wars aesthetics

**Same universe. Completely different genres. Different mechanics needed for each.**

The dressing (Star Wars) is cosmetic. The genre (hero's journey, war movie, political thriller) is load-bearing—it determines what mechanics create the intended experience.

**Most designers confuse these.** They think "I'm making a Star Wars game" tells them what to build. It doesn't. "I'm making a political thriller in Star Wars dressing" tells them what to build.

## The D\&D 4th Edition Warning

Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition (2008) is the cautionary tale every game designer should know.

**What they did right:**

* Balanced martial and caster classes perfectly
* Created elegant tactical combat on a grid
* Streamlined rules eliminated decades of accumulated cruft
* Fixed genuine mechanical problems from 3.5 Edition

**What they did wrong:**

* Lost the "D\&D feel"
* Mechanics screamed "tactical board game"
* Context said "D\&D fantasy adventure"
* The dissonance was fatal

**Result:** Commercial failure. Pathfinder (a 3.5e fork) outsold it. 5th Edition completely reversed course.

**The lesson:** You can have mechanically superior systems that fail because they violate context/identity. Technical excellence doesn't save you if the context doesn't deliver the intended experience.

4th Edition was competent tactical combat. But it wasn't *D\&D*. The context broke what made D\&D feel like D\&D.

## What This Chapter Covers

This chapter teaches you to design context that actually matters—context that transforms mechanics into meaningful experiences rather than just painting over them.

**You'll learn:**

**1. How to choose context from aesthetic goals** (Part 2)

* Not "what setting is cool" but "what context creates the experience I want"
* The decision tree from aesthetic to genre to dressing
* Why genre is load-bearing and dressing is (often) cosmetic

**2. How to test if your context matters** (Part 3)

* The Space Coffee Test: Could you reskin this without changing anything?
* Five levels from pure cosmetic to context-as-system
* When context is working vs when it's just decoration

**3. How to maintain perspective** (Part 4)

* Why you CAN show the alien, but not doing comedy pratfalls
* Every element must serve the overall feeling you're creating
* How to identify what breaks your intended perspective

**4. What to build explicitly vs suggest vs omit** (Part 5)

* Strategic restraint: When showing less creates more engagement
* Build/Suggest/Omit decisions for each context element
* How genre affects these ratios

**5. How to create a context design document** (Part 6)

* From abstract decisions to concrete buildable plan
* Templates for world rules, perspective maintenance, content inventory
* Integration with mechanics, resources, and balance

**6. How context creates player behavior** (Part 7)

* Dynamics: The bridge between mechanics and aesthetics
* How same mechanics + different context = different player actions
* Why Weather Factory's games feel completely different despite identical systems

**7. How to ensure everything aligns** (Part 8)

* Coherence across genre, perspective, mechanics, resources, balance
* What happens when elements contradict (Andromeda, D\&D 4e)
* Integration checklists

**8. How to validate your context is working** (Part 9)

* Observable behaviors by aesthetic (horror players cautious, cozy players relaxed)
* Specific questions to ask during playtesting
* When to iterate vs rebuild

## What This Chapter Doesn't Cover

**We explicitly do NOT cover:**

**Worldbuilding craft skills:**

* How to design believable economies
* How to create fictional cultures
* How to draw maps or design political systems
* How to write compelling character backstories

These are valuable skills, but they're craft execution, not design framework. We assume you can write or will learn to write. This chapter focuses on *what to write and why*, not *how to write it well*.

**Lore writing techniques:**

* Prose style and voice
* Dialogue writing
* Description techniques
* Narrative structure

Again, craft skills. Important, but not our focus.

**Art direction or visual design:**

* Color palettes and visual style
* UI/UX design
* Character or environment art
* Audio design

Visual presentation reinforces context but isn't context itself.

**How to choose aesthetics:**

* Chapter 1 (What Is a Game System?) covers this
* We start from the assumption you've chosen your aesthetic goals
* This chapter is about choosing and building context that serves those goals

***

## How This Chapter Integrates

**Prerequisites (you should have read):**

* **Chapter 1 - What Is a Game System:** Aesthetics framework, MDA, purpose-first design
* **Chapter 2 - Resource Management:** What resources serve which aesthetics
* **Chapter 3 - Cognitive Load:** How complexity affects player experience
* **Chapter 4 - Balance:** Paradigms and how they match aesthetics

**This chapter provides:**

* Context selection framework (aesthetic → genre → dressing)
* Build/Suggest/Omit decision tools
* Perspective maintenance guidance
* Integration points between context and other systems

**What comes after (future chapters):**

* **Synthesis Chapter:** How everything combines in practice
* **LLM Integration (future):** How to use LLMs for context generation without losing specificity

## A Note on Terminology

**We use these terms with specific meanings:**

**Context:** The framing, setting, tone, and thematic elements that give mechanics meaning. This includes genre, dressing, perspective, and all the specific details you build.

**Genre:** The load-bearing structural type (mystery investigation, horror survival, political thriller, etc.). This determines what mechanics you need and how they should work.

**Dressing:** The cosmetic layer (Star Wars, medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, etc.). This can often be swapped without changing the core experience.

**Perspective:** The overall feeling/framing you're maintaining (unknowable threat, solvable puzzle, cosmic wonder, safe comfort, etc.). Every element must serve this.

**Build:** Explicit detail that's fully specified and known to players.

**Suggest:** Hints, fragments, and implications that players piece together or imagine.

**Omit:** Deliberately absent or hidden information that mystery serves better than answers.

**Aesthetic:** The emotional/experiential goal (from MDA framework). What players should feel.

**Dynamics:** The behaviors that emerge when players interact with mechanics within context. Not what they CAN do, but what they DO do.

***

## The Core Principle

**Context is not decoration.**

Context transforms mechanics into meaning. It's the difference between:

* Drawing a card and feeling dread vs feeling contentment (Weather Factory)
* The same universe supporting hero's journey vs war movie vs political thriller (Star Wars)
* Mechanically superior game failing vs inferior game succeeding (D\&D 4e vs 5e)

**When context works:**

* Every element serves the same aesthetic
* Genre creates the structural experience
* Dressing reinforces without contradicting
* Perspective is maintained throughout
* Players do what you want them to do (dynamics)
* Everything feels coherent and intentional

**When context fails:**

* Setting is interchangeable (space coffee)
* Expensive detail that doesn't affect experience (Andromeda)
* Contradictory signals (D\&D 4e tactical board game in RPG dressing)
* Players behave opposite to intention (combat in mystery game)
* Breaks in perspective (comedy in horror, randomness in mystery)
