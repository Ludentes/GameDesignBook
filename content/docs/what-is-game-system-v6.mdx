# What is a Game System?

## Introduction: Beyond "The Rules"

A game system is not simply "the rules." It's not a resolution mechanic (d20, 2d6, cards). It's not a collection of subsystems bolted together.

**A game system is the designed interplay between mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing that creates a reproducible experience through player interaction with internal rules.**

This definition emerges from examining how actual game systems—both foundational and experimental—have evolved, failed, and succeeded. Rather than theoretical ideal, it's grounded in how designers have solved concrete problems across fifty years of game design history.

### Two Dimensions of Understanding

This document approaches game systems from two perspectives:

**Structural (What systems are made of):**

* Components: Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing, Configuration
* Patterns: Core loops, Engagement curves, Flow states
* These answer: "What are the building blocks?"

**Functional (What systems actually do):**

* Functions: Adjudication, Information management, Content generation, Persistence, Cognitive encoding
* Purposes: Experiences systems create, boundaries systems respect
* These answer: "What work does the system perform?"

**Both perspectives are essential.** Knowing what a system is made of tells you how to build it. Knowing what a system does tells you what to build.

**A note on this framework:** This document represents current understanding based on historical analysis. The need to address both structural and functional dimensions separately suggests the foundation may need deeper integration in future work. We acknowledge this limitation while providing the best current synthesis.

## The Core Insight: Purpose Before Mechanics

**The most important lesson across all systems:**

Systems that succeed start with the intended experience (aesthetic) and design mechanics to serve it. Systems that fail start with cool mechanics and try to find a use for them.

This is the MDA framework's reversal:

* **Players experience:** Aesthetics → Dynamics → Mechanics
* **Designers create:** Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics
* **But designers should START with:** Aesthetics (what experience?) → then design Mechanics/Dynamics to achieve it

### Examples of Getting This Right

**D\&D 5e:**

* Aesthetic: Accessible + traditional D\&D feel
* Mechanic: Advantage/disadvantage (elegant, no modifier stacking)
* Result: Best-selling D\&D edition

**Powered by the Apocalypse:**

* Aesthetic: Genre-specific experiences (teen drama, heist thriller, etc.)
* Mechanic: Fiction-first moves that encode genre
* Result: Infinite variety from simple core

**Weather Factory (Book of Hours):**

* Aesthetic: Cozy, meditative library restoration
* Mechanic: Same card+verb+timer as Cultist Simulator
* Parameters: No pressure, no threats, abundant time
* Result: Completely different feeling from same mechanics

### Examples of Getting This Wrong

**D\&D 4e:**

* Started with: Balanced tactical combat (mechanic focus)
* Lost: D\&D's identity and feel
* Result: Commercial failure, fans forked to Pathfinder

**Lesson:** You can't just "fix problems" (4e was technically superior). You must preserve what makes the experience meaningful.

## Part 1: The Foundational Systems

### Why D\&D and Civilization Matter

D\&D and Civilization are foundational for a reason: they **defined categories** and showed designers what's possible at scale. They're not the only important systems, but they're historically necessary.

**D\&D** (1974 to present) demonstrates:

* How systems survive radical redesign (five complete editions)
* What must stay constant (six attributes, levels, hit points)
* How mechanical changes cascade into different experiences (3e vs. 5e)
* The limits of complexity (3.5e's baroque optimization vs. 5e's elegant simplicity)
* That player identity matters more than mechanical elegance

**Civilization** (1991 to present) demonstrates:

* How systems manage complexity over time (Civ I simple → Civ IV complex → Civ V simplified → Civ VI smartly complex)
* That spatial/visual complexity feels different from numerical complexity
* How feedback loops create compulsion ("one more turn")
* That multiple paths to success creates replayability
* How interface IS part of the system (adjacency bonuses in Civ VI changed strategy)

These aren't equal to all other systems—they're foundational because they showed categories of problems and solutions that every other designer builds from or reacts against.

### D\&D's 50-Year Evolution: What Systems Must Manage

**The core pattern:** D\&D shows how designers respond to specific problems each edition identifies.

**OD\&D → AD\&D (1974-1977):** Players needed consistent rulings for tournament play. Solution: Codify everything. Lesson: Systematization enables markets but constrains emergent play.

**AD\&D 2e → 3e (1989-2000):** Every resolution mechanic was different (Thac0 for combat, ability checks variable, saves on tables). Solution: Unified d20 system. Lesson: One elegant core mechanic unifies experience, but invites endless expansion.

**3.5e → 4e (2008):** Martial classes were underpowered compared to casters; system had grown baroque. Solution: Powers system for everyone, tactical grid emphasis. Result: Technically superior but commercially failed (Pathfinder outsold it). Lesson: Mechanical excellence alone is insufficient; you must preserve what players love.

**4e → 5e (2014):** 4e felt like a board game, not D\&D. Solution: Return to tradition with modern design (advantage/disadvantage, bounded accuracy). Result: Most successful edition ever. Lesson: Sometimes simplification > innovation.

**What D\&D teaches about systems:**

* Core identity matters more than mechanical perfection (six attributes remained constant through five editions)
* Can't fix problems by violating identity (4e proved this)
* Simplicity, carefully designed, beats complex optimization
* Accessibility expands audiences (5e's triumph)
* Systems evolve in response to specific problems, but solutions must preserve purpose

### Civilization's 25-Year Progression: Complexity and Pacing

**The parallel evolution:** Civilization shows what happens when you manage complexity in a computed medium (no human adjudication required).

**I → II → III → IV:** Each added systems. Depth increased, tedium increased.

**IV → V:** Radical simplification. Removed Religion, Espionage, Corporations. Changed fundamental interaction (One Unit Per Tile instead of stacking). Hexagonal grid instead of square. Reception: Divisive. Hardcore players hated simplification. New players loved accessibility.

**V → VI:** Managed complexity return. Districts (spatial complexity) instead of numerical optimization. Eureka moments (guiding progression instead of pure freedom). Result: Depth without tedium.

**What Civilization teaches about systems:**

* Complexity is a budget; spend wisely
* Spatial/visual complexity (districts) feels better than numerical complexity (spreadsheets)
* Positive feedback loops create compulsion (cities grow → more production → faster growth)
* Near-miss losses drive replays ("if only I'd built that three turns earlier")
* Short-term goals (units finishing soon) + long-term planning (fifty turns to victory) creates "one more turn" feeling
* UI/interface matters as much as mechanics

## Part 2: The Five Components of a Game System

A game system consists of five interlocking components. Change any one, you change the experience. Understanding these components provides a practical framework for both analyzing existing systems and designing new ones.

### 1. Mechanics (What You Can Do)

**Definition:** The rules governing player actions and resolutions.

**Components:**

* **Resolution mechanics:** How outcomes are determined (dice, cards, timers, algorithms)
* **Action space:** What players can choose to do
* **Resource tracking:** What gets measured and how

**Examples:**

* D\&D: d20 + modifier vs DC (resolution), classes define actions, track HP/spells
* PbtA: 2d6 + stat, 10+/7-9/6- tiers (resolution), moves define actions, track harm/stress
* Cultist Simulator: Card + verb + timer (resolution), six verbs define actions, track everything as cards
* XCOM: 2 actions per turn (resolution), class abilities define options, track HP/will/ammo

**Key insight from evolution:**

* Simple core mechanics enable complex applications (PbtA's 2d6, XCOM's 2 actions)
* Unified mechanics feel coherent (D\&D 3e's d20 for everything)
* Mechanics should fade into background, not demand constant attention

**From Weather Factory:**
The same mechanic (card+verb+timer) can serve radically different purposes through different configurations.

### 2. Parameters (How Much, How Fast, How Scarce)

**Definition:** The numerical and constraint settings that determine feel and pacing.

**Components:**

* **Scarcity levels:** How abundant or limited are resources?
* **Speed/timing:** How fast do things happen? How long do timers run?
* **Limits:** How much can you carry? How many actions? How big can your board get?
* **Threat levels:** How dangerous is failure? How permanent are consequences?
* **Recovery rates:** How quickly do resources replenish?

**Examples - Same Mechanic, Different Parameters:**

**Cultist Simulator (Horror):**

* Scarcity: Everything scarce, drowning in unusable cards
* Speed: 60-second timers with constant Time Passes drain
* Limit: Unlimited board (overwhelm as mechanic)
* Threat: Death constantly imminent (Dread, Fascination, Starvation)
* Recovery: Minimal, expensive

**Book of Hours (Cozy):**

* Scarcity: Resources abundant, gentle acquisition
* Speed: Same 60-second timers but no pressure
* Limit: Organized, not overwhelming
* Threat: Practically none
* Recovery: Generous, forgiving

**Same mechanics, completely different experiences through parameter changes.**

**Other examples:**

* XCOM: Original (14 soldiers, deadly) vs EU (4-6 soldiers, each matters more)
* D\&D: 4e (high HP, hard to die) vs 5e (lower HP, deadlier)
* Civ: IV (complex, many systems) vs V (streamlined) vs VI (smart complexity)

**Key insight:**
Parameters matter as much as mechanics. You can achieve variety through tuning without inventing new mechanics.

### 3. Context (What It Means)

**Definition:** The framing, setting, tone, and thematic elements that give mechanics meaning.

**Components:**

* **Setting/fiction:** Where does this take place? What's the story?
* **Tone/aesthetics:** Horror, cozy, heroic, gritty, comedic?
* **Goals/victory conditions:** What are you trying to achieve?
* **Thematic framing:** What does this represent? What's it about?

**From Weather Factory - Context IS System:**

Kennedy (writer first, designer second) proves context isn't "just skin":

* Horror context + card crafting = horror experience
* Cozy context + same mechanics = cozy experience
* Context transforms how mechanics feel

**Other examples:**

* PbtA: Monsterhearts (teen drama) vs Dungeon World (heroic fantasy) - same 2d6 engine, completely different through moves and tone
* FATE: Dresden Files (urban fantasy mystery) vs Spirit of the Century (pulp action) - same aspects system, different through setting
* D\&D: Same rules feel different in gothic horror vs high fantasy vs gritty realism

**Same mechanic, different context, different meaning:**

**Card game mechanic: "Draw card, place card, resolve effect"**

**Context A: "Researching forbidden magic"**

* Cards represent occult texts, mystical insights, dangerous knowledge
* Drawing = discovering secrets
* Placement = conducting rituals
* Resolution = magical consequences
* Feels: Mysterious, dangerous, scholarly

**Context B: "Managing restaurant supplies"**

* Cards represent ingredients, equipment, recipes
* Drawing = receiving shipments
* Placement = assigning to stations
* Resolution = meal preparation
* Feels: Practical, managerial, mundane

**Identical mechanics. Completely different experiences.**

**Key insight:**
Context is systemic, not cosmetic. It shapes how players interpret mechanics and what choices feel meaningful. Choose context early—it determines what mechanics mean.

### 4. Pacing (When Things Happen)

**Definition:** The rhythm, timing, and flow of gameplay.

**Components:**

* **Time structure:** Real-time, turn-based, hybrid?
* **Pressure curves:** When is there urgency? When is there breathing room?
* **Escalation:** How does tension build?
* **Rhythm:** What's the beat of play? (Combat-rest-combat, or constant pressure, or meditative flow?)

**Examples:**

**XCOM 2 timed missions:**

* Same mechanics as Enemy Unknown
* Added turn limits
* Created aggressive playstyle (vs defensive overwatch crawl)
* Controversial but effective at changing pacing

**Cultist Simulator vs Book of Hours:**

* Same 60-second timers
* Cultist: Timers create pressure (Time Passes kills you)
* Book of Hours: Timers just show progress (no death threat)
* Same mechanic, different meaning through threat context

**D\&D rest cycles:**

* Short rest (1 hour) vs Long rest (8 hours)
* Creates rhythm: Combat → resources depleted → rest → combat
* 4e vs 5e differences in what recovers when = different pacing

**Civ's "one more turn":**

* Short-term goals constantly completing (2-3 turns)
* Long-term planning (50+ turns)
* Creates compulsion through layered pacing

**Key insight:**
Pacing transforms how mechanics feel. Same resolution mechanic can create urgency or meditation depending on when and why you use it.

### 5. Configuration (How It All Combines)

**Definition:** The way mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing integrate to create coherent experience.

**This is where "system" emerges from "mechanics":**

A pile of mechanics isn't a system. A system is when the components work together to consistently create an intended experience.

**Good configuration (coherent):**

* Every component serves the same aesthetic goal
* Mechanics, parameters, context, pacing all aligned
* Players intuitively understand what the game wants them to do
* Feels unified, not bolted-together

**Bad configuration (incoherent):**

* Components working at cross-purposes
* Mechanics say one thing, context says another
* Players confused about what matters
* Feels like different games stapled together

**Examples:**

**D\&D 5e (Good configuration):**

* Aesthetic: Accessible heroic fantasy
* Mechanics: Simple core (d20+mod), complex application
* Parameters: Bounded accuracy (math stays manageable)
* Context: Medieval fantasy, heroic tone
* Pacing: Combat-rest cycles, episodic adventures
* **Result:** Everything reinforces "accessible traditional D\&D"

**D\&D 4e (Poor configuration):**

* Aesthetic goal: Balanced tactical combat
* Mechanics: Powers for everyone (MMO-like)
* Parameters: High HP, lots of healing
* Context: D\&D branding (medieval fantasy)
* Pacing: Grid-mandatory tactical encounters
* **Problem:** Mechanics said "tactical board game," context said "D\&D RPG" - incoherent
* **Result:** Commercial failure despite technical excellence

**Key insight:**
Configuration is the art of game design. It's not enough to have good mechanics, good parameters, good context, and good pacing. They must all work together toward the same experience goal.

## Part 3: The Revolutionary Systems

### PbtA's Different Model: Same Engine, Different Implementations

**Where D\&D evolves one system, PbtA proves that one engine supports many purposes.**

Powered by the Apocalypse (2010) introduced a fiction-first resolution model:

```
When you [specific action in fiction], roll 2d6 + stat:
- 10+: Success
- 7-9: Success with cost/complication
- 6-: Failure, GM makes a move
```

This created an engine that spawned descendants, each reconfiguring the same core for different purposes:

| Game             | Purpose                   | Key Reconfiguration                                           | Result                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Apocalypse World | Post-apocalyptic survival | Resources scarce, threats constant, morally ambiguous         | Gritty, harsh, player agency                   |
| Dungeon World    | D\&D fantasy              | Traditional classes, forgiving HP, treasure focus             | Heroic, adventurous, clear goals               |
| Monsterhearts    | Teen supernatural drama   | Labels (not fixed stats), Strings (social capital), sex moves | Intimate, social warfare, fluid identity       |
| The Sprawl       | Cyberpunk heists          | Mission structure, corporate threats, hacker subsystem        | Tactical, organized, team-based                |
| Masks            | Teen superheroes          | No stats (Labels shift), emotional conditions, coming-of-age  | Identity-focused, dependent-to-independent arc |

**Same 2d6 + stat core. Completely different games.**

What changed:

* What moves exist (triggered by fiction)
* What resources matter (Barter vs. Strings vs. Influence)
* What stats represent (survival skills vs. social identity vs. how others see you)
* What playbooks embody (survival roles vs. fantasy classes vs. teen archetypes)
* What success looks like (freedom vs. heroism vs. social validation vs. mission completion vs. maturity)

**Why PbtA matters:** It proves that identical mechanics can serve opposite experiences through configuration, not mechanics. It also proves this principle works at scale (dozens of PbtA games, thriving community).

**What PbtA teaches:**

* Simple core mechanics enable more variation than complex ones
* Configuration (moves, stats, resources, playbooks) determines experience more than resolution mechanic
* Purpose determines moves; moves determine play
* Same engine can serve niche audiences (heist thriller, teen drama) that demand different experiences

## Part 4: The Academic Framework

### MDA (Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics)

The MDA framework, formalized by Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek (2004), provides essential vocabulary:

**Mechanics:** The rules, data, algorithms (what designers directly control)

**Dynamics:** The runtime behavior (what emerges when mechanics interact and players engage)

**Aesthetics:** The emotional responses players experience (what players actually feel)

**Critical insight:** Design flows **Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics** (cause to effect), but designers should **START with Aesthetics** (desired experience), then work backward to design mechanics that create it.

**The fundamental principle: We control mechanics, we predict dynamics, but players come back for aesthetics.**

You cannot code emotions directly, but you must design for them. Most failed designs reverse this: "I have cool mechanics (cards! timers! powers!) → what experience can I make?" This is backwards. Successful designs start: "I want players to feel X → what mechanics create that?"

**How D\&D 5e used this correctly:**

1. Desired aesthetic: Accessible, heroic fantasy that feels traditionally D\&D
2. Designed mechanics: Advantage/disadvantage (simple), bounded accuracy (elegant), backgrounds (narrative)
3. Result: Perfect alignment between intended experience and mechanics

**How D\&D 4e failed this:**

1. Desired aesthetic: Balanced, tactical combat
2. Designed mechanics: Powers system, grid-mandatory, roles
3. Problem: Mechanics screamed "board game" while context said "D\&D"
4. Result: Mechanics-first design, aesthetics didn't match

**MDA Applied: Market Gap Analysis**

The Vampire Survivors example demonstrates perfect aesthetic-first thinking:

**Existing aesthetics in the game:**

* Power fantasy (you become overwhelmingly strong)
* Build crafting (experimenting with weapon combinations)
* "One more run" compulsion (sessions are short, outcomes vary)

**Missing aesthetic identified:** Competition

* Players could optimize builds but had no way to compare performance
* Social dimension was absent
* No way to demonstrate mastery to others

**Solution:** Add leaderboard mechanic

* Minimal mechanical addition (just tracking and displaying scores)
* Unlocked entirely new aesthetic (competitive, comparative, social)
* Huge impact on retention and community

**Why this worked:**

* Started with aesthetic gap, not "what features should we add?"
* Added minimal mechanics to serve aesthetic goal
* Validated that aesthetic actually mattered to players
* Perfect example of aesthetic → mechanic design flow

**Identifying Missing Aesthetics: A Framework**

The Vampire Survivors example demonstrates systematic aesthetic gap analysis:

1. **Map existing aesthetics in market**
   * What do successful games in this space deliver?
   * Power fantasy? Mastery? Fellowship? Discovery?

2. **Identify conspicuous absences**
   * What aesthetics are players seeking in adjacent genres?
   * What do communities discuss but can't find?

3. **Verify demand exists**
   * Are players asking for this in forums/reviews?
   * Do adjacent genres deliver this aesthetic successfully?

4. **Design minimal addition that unlocks aesthetic**
   * Don't redesign everything
   * Add the smallest thing that creates the missing experience
   * Vampire Survivors: just leaderboard → unlocked competition

5. **Maintain coherent configuration**
   * Addition must ENHANCE core loop, not break it
   * Test: does it feel like natural evolution or bolted-on feature?

This market-aware design approach (sometimes called "aesthetic gap analysis") validates that:

* Aesthetic-first design isn't just good design—it's good strategy
* Understanding what players want (but can't find) guides aesthetic choice
* Coherent configuration matters commercially, not just experientially

**Note:** This framework helps you choose WHICH aesthetic to target for your system. The rest of this document helps you design HOW to deliver that aesthetic successfully.

### Ludology and Emergence

Ludology (the academic study of games as rule-based systems) identifies that **systems with relatively simple rules can produce complex, emergent behaviors** that designers don't explicitly program.

Examples:

* **Chess:** Simple rules (how pieces move), infinitely complex emergent play
* **Minecraft:** Simple core (place/break blocks), emerges as storytelling engine, engineering platform, creative canvas
* **Dwarf Fortress:** Thousands of simple rules interact, producing legendary stories (and catastrophes)
* **Emergent Narrative in Deus Ex:** Designer surprised when players used wall-mounted mines as climbing pitons

**Key insight:** Emergence happens when simple rules interact without designers prescripting all outcomes. This is powerful but risky—you must test extensively because you can't predict everything.

### Player Types (Bartle and Evolution)

Richard Bartle's player taxonomy (1996) identifies four types of players:

**Achievers:** Want to accomplish goals, gain status, optimize performance

* Motivated by: Progression, mastery, completion
* Engage with: Challenge systems, achievement tracking, optimization paths

**Explorers:** Want to discover content, understand systems, find secrets

* Motivated by: Discovery, knowledge, experimentation
* Engage with: Hidden content, system depth, emergent interactions

**Socializers:** Want to interact with others, form relationships, share experiences

* Motivated by: Connection, community, collaboration
* Engage with: Social systems, cooperative play, shared narratives

**Killers:** Want to dominate others, demonstrate superiority, impose will

* Motivated by: Competition, victory, status hierarchy
* Engage with: PvP systems, leaderboards, competitive rankings

**Important evolution:** Bartle's taxonomy was created for MUDs (text-based virtual worlds). Modern understanding recognizes:

* Players aren't fixed types—they shift based on context, mood, game phase
* Most players exhibit multiple motivations simultaneously
* Systems should serve multiple player types, not just one
* The balance of player types shapes community culture

**Design implications:**

* Know which player types your system primarily serves
* Don't try to serve all equally (leads to diluted focus)
* Provide paths for different motivations
* Consider how different types interact (cooperative vs. conflicting)

## Part 5: Core Loops and Session Architecture

### Core Loops: The Heartbeat of Systems

A core loop is **the smallest complete circuit of action, feedback, reward, and motivation that brings the player back to take action again.** This is what players do over and over, sometimes hundreds of times per session. If your core loop isn't satisfying, nothing else matters.

**Core loop structure:**

1. **Action:** Player does something
2. **Feedback:** System responds immediately
3. **Reward:** Player receives outcome (success, progress, information, emotion)
4. **Motivation:** Outcome creates desire to take action again

**Examples across different systems:**

**Wordle:**

* Guess word → See colored feedback → Adjust strategy → Guess again
* Loop completes in seconds, repeats 6 times per puzzle
* Reward: Information (which letters work) + Progress (closer to solution)
* Motivation: Desire to solve before running out of guesses

**Civilization:**

* Choose action → See immediate effect → Plan next turn → Choose action again
* Loop completes in 30-60 seconds, repeats hundreds of times
* Reward: Progress (city grows, unit builds, research advances)
* Motivation: "One more turn" compulsion

**D\&D Combat:**

* Declare action → Roll dice → Resolve outcome → Next turn
* Loop completes in 1-3 minutes, repeats 20-40 times per combat
* Reward: Tactical success, resource management, narrative progression
* Motivation: Desire to survive, win, see what happens next

**Critical distinction: Tasks end. Loops continue.**

Traditional task-completion thinking: "User completes form → System saves data → Done."

Core loop thinking: "Player acts → System responds with satisfaction + hook → Player wants to act again."

**Design implications:**

* Every system element should either enhance or protect the core loop
* If a mechanic breaks the loop's rhythm, it damages engagement
* Different loops serve different purposes (Wordle: puzzle-solving, Civ: expansion, D\&D: tactical drama)
* The loop must be satisfying even when repeated hundreds of times

### Engagement Curves: Session Pacing

A successful session has a **temporal shape**—engagement rises and falls in predictable patterns. Understanding these patterns lets you design for them.

**The five-phase engagement curve:**

**Phase 1: Hook (0-30 seconds)**

* Player's curiosity peaks
* First impression determines whether they continue
* Engagement is HIGH but fragile
* Design goal: Immediate intrigue, clarity of purpose, first success

**Examples:**

* Vampire Survivors: Kill enemies within 5 seconds of starting
* Wordle: See the empty grid, understand immediately what to do
* D\&D: "You're standing at the entrance to the dungeon" (question answered immediately: what do we do?)

**Phase 2: Onboarding (30 seconds - 2 minutes)**

* Understanding develops
* Player learns basic mechanics
* Engagement: Moderate, building confidence
* Design goal: Clear feedback, early wins, obvious next steps

**Phase 3: Early Mastery (2-5 minutes)**

* Competence emerges
* Player feels "I can do this"
* Engagement: Rising, satisfaction from success
* Design goal: Validate skill, introduce complexity gradually, reward experimentation

**Phase 4: Flow State (5-15+ minutes)**

* Challenge perfectly matches skill
* Time disappears, self-consciousness fades
* Engagement: Peak, sustained
* Design goal: Maintain balance, escalate smoothly, avoid jarring interruptions

**Phase 5: Exit Hook (Session end)**

* Create reason to return
* Leave player satisfied but wanting more
* Engagement: Declining gracefully, anticipation building
* Design goal: Cliffhanger, progress saved, preview of what's next

**Examples of different pacing strategies:**

**Candy Crush:** 3-minute levels, steadily increasing complexity

* Hook: Colorful board, immediate understanding
* Onboarding: First few moves are obvious
* Early Mastery: "I can match these!"
* Flow: Level demands attention, rewards strategy
* Exit Hook: "Next level unlocked!" or "Try again?" (with visible progress toward goal)

**Chess (blitz):** 30-second decisions, intense throughout

* Hook: Setup is familiar, clock creates immediate pressure
* Onboarding: Opening moves are practiced
* Early Mastery: Position develops, threats emerge
* Flow: Every move matters, time pressure sustains attention
* Exit Hook: Checkmate or time expiration creates definitive conclusion

**Chess (correspondence):** 30-day games, deep analysis

* Different engagement curve entirely—designed for contemplation, not flow state
* Multiple "sessions" within one game
* Each move is its own micro-session with analysis phase

**D\&D Session:** 3-4 hour sessions, multiple engagement peaks

* Hook: Recap + immediate situation ("The dragon turns toward you")
* Multiple mini-loops throughout session (combat, exploration, social interaction)
* Each scene has its own engagement curve
* Exit Hook: Cliffhanger or resolution with clear next goal

**Design implications:**

* Know your target session length
* Design engagement curve for that length
* Get the hook wrong → players never reach flow
* Get flow wrong → players leave unsatisfied
* Get exit hook wrong → players don't return
* Different audiences need different curves (exhausted parents ≠ competitive gamers)

## Part 6: Flow State and Challenge Management

### Flow Theory: The Psychology of Optimal Experience

Flow state is when a player is **completely absorbed in an activity where challenge perfectly matches skill.** Time disappears. Self-consciousness fades. The activity becomes autotelic—worth doing for its own sake.

**The Flow Channel:**

```
High Challenge
    │
    │  ANXIETY      
    │  (Too hard,   
    │   skill low)  
    │       │       
    │       │  FLOW STATE
    │       │  (Challenge = Skill)
    │       │       │
    │       │       │  BOREDOM
    │       │       │  (Too easy,
    │       │       │   skill high)
    │   ────┼───────┼──────────→ High Skill
    │       │       │
    Low     │       │
  Skill     │       │
```

**Three failure states:**

1. **High Challenge + Low Skill = Anxiety/Frustration → Player quits**
   * Example: D\&D encounter too deadly for party level
   * Player feels: "This is impossible, I can't win"
   * Result: Abandonment, negative emotion

2. **High Skill + Low Challenge = Boredom → Player quits**
   * Example: Veteran player facing trivial enemies
   * Player feels: "This is pointless, no effort required"
   * Result: Disengagement, seeking challenge elsewhere

3. **Challenge = Skill = Flow → Player continues**
   * Example: Perfectly tuned boss fight
   * Player feels: "This is hard but I can do it if I focus"
   * Result: Deep engagement, satisfaction, desire to continue

**Requirements for flow state:**

1. **Clear goals:** Player knows what they're trying to accomplish
2. **Immediate feedback:** System responds quickly to actions
3. **Challenge-skill balance:** Difficulty matches player's current ability
4. **Focused attention:** Task demands concentration
5. **Sense of control:** Player feels their choices matter
6. **Loss of self-consciousness:** Player stops monitoring themselves, focuses on task
7. **Time transformation:** Hours feel like minutes

**Progressive difficulty and flow maintenance:**

Flow requires that **challenge grows as skill grows.** Static difficulty breaks flow:

* Difficulty too low → boredom (player's skill grew, challenge didn't)
* Difficulty too high → anxiety (challenge spiked, skill hasn't caught up)

**Successful progression examples:**

**Civilization:** Early game (explore + expand) → Mid game (develop + defend) → Late game (dominate + win)

* Complexity increases as player understanding grows
* Early turns are simple, late turns demand strategic depth
* Player feels: "I'm managing an empire" (not "I'm managing spreadsheets")

**Dark Souls:** Each enemy encounter teaches mechanics needed for boss

* Early enemies: Basic timing, single attacks
* Mid-area enemies: Combinations, environmental hazards
* Boss: Everything learned, applied with precision
* Deaths aren't failures, they're learning opportunities

**D\&D 5e:** CR (Challenge Rating) system scales with party level

* Level 1 party faces CR 1/4 enemies (goblins, bandits)
* Level 10 party faces CR 10 enemies (stone giants, young dragons)
* Mechanics stay same, numbers scale

**Recovery mechanics: Guiding frustrated players back to flow**

When players hit frustration (challenge > skill), punishing them makes it worse. Good systems guide them back:

**Dark Souls approach: Learning through repetition**

* Death isn't game over, it's "try again"
* Each attempt teaches (enemy patterns become familiar)
* Bonfire checkpoints reduce frustration cost
* Player agency preserved (can summon help, change strategy, level up)

**Civilization approach: Multiple paths to success**

* Struggling militarily? Try cultural victory
* Can't win wars? Focus on science/diplomacy
* System accommodates different skill profiles
* Failure in one domain doesn't mean game over

**D\&D approach: GM adjustment**

* Encounters can be adjusted mid-combat (fewer enemies, different tactics)
* Rest opportunities restore resources
* NPC assistance available if needed
* Social contract: GM's job is challenge, not TPK

**Bad recovery mechanics:**

* Punishing failure (lose progression, must replay hours of content)
* No alternative paths (only one way to overcome challenge)
* Unclear feedback (player doesn't know why they failed or what to change)
* Escalating difficulty after failure (making it harder when player is already struggling)

### The Investment/Payoff Spectrum: Designing for Player Energy States

A critical but often overlooked aspect of flow and engagement is **matching system demands to player energy states.** The same player needs different experiences depending on their available mental and emotional resources.

**The Investment/Payoff Framework:**

**Investment:** What the system asks from players

* Cognitive load (how much thinking required?)
* Emotional energy (how much do you need to care?)
* Time commitment (how long per session?)
* Attention demand (can you multitask or must you focus?)
* Physical energy (reflexes, precision, speed?)

**Payoff:** What the system delivers

* Satisfaction depth (how rewarding is success?)
* Emotional resonance (how much do you feel?)
* Progression visibility (how clear is advancement?)
* Skill expression (how much does mastery matter?)
* Story/meaning (what do you take away?)

**The fundamental principle: Payoff must justify investment for your target player in their target state.**

**Player Energy States:**

**1. Exhausted/Depleted (Parent after work, student after exams)**

* Available investment: LOW (15-30 minutes, minimal cognitive load)
* Needs: Clear goals, obvious actions, immediate feedback, low stakes
* Examples that work: Wordle (5 minutes, clear goal, satisfying), Candy Crush (3-minute levels, no complex decisions)
* Examples that fail: Cultist Simulator (requires sustained attention, opaque mechanics)

**2. Casual/Relaxed (Weekend morning, commute entertainment)**

* Available investment: MODERATE (30-60 minutes, light engagement)
* Needs: Pick-up-and-play, forgiving mistakes, pleasant atmosphere
* Examples that work: Book of Hours (cozy, forgiving, beautiful), casual Civ (can stop anytime)
* Examples that fail: Competitive ranked games (high stakes, stressful)

**3. Energized/Focused (Gaming session night, hobby time)**

* Available investment: HIGH (2-4 hours, deep engagement, high stakes acceptable)
* Needs: Depth, challenge, meaningful decisions, skill expression
* Examples that work: D\&D session (complex, social, engaging), XCOM Ironman (high stakes, rewarding)
* Examples that fail: Mobile idle games (insufficient depth, boring when focused)

**4. Dedicated/Obsessed (Hobby mastery, competitive play)**

* Available investment: EXTREME (hours daily, studying meta, optimization)
* Needs: Mastery curves, competitive depth, emergent complexity
* Examples that work: Cultist Simulator (demands mastery), competitive chess, optimization-heavy games
* Examples that fail: Casual games with low skill ceiling (mastered too quickly)

**Design Implications:**

**Know your target energy state:**

* Don't design a deep strategic game for exhausted players
* Don't design a casual game for dedicated players
* Mismatch = failure regardless of quality

**Examples of successful matching:**

**Wordle: Designed for exhausted/casual**

* Investment: 5 minutes, one puzzle, clear goal
* Payoff: Satisfying solve, shareable result, daily streak
* Perfect for morning coffee or work break
* Works because investment matches available energy

**Cultist Simulator: Designed for dedicated**

* Investment: Hours to understand, requires note-taking, opaque mechanics
* Payoff: Deep satisfaction from mastery, unique experience
* Perfect for players with time and energy to invest
* Works because payoff justifies high investment

**D\&D 5e: Flexible across states**

* Can be casual (theater of mind, simple encounters)
* Can be dedicated (tactical combat, optimization, deep roleplay)
* Accessibility allows same system to serve different energy levels
* Works because DM can tune investment level

**Examples of failed matching:**

**Complex mobile RPG marketed as "casual"**

* Promises: Quick sessions, easy to learn
* Reality: Requires daily grinding, complex systems, meta knowledge
* Mismatch: Marketed to exhausted, designed for dedicated
* Result: High churn, angry reviews

**"Hardcore" game that's actually simple**

* Promises: Deep strategy, mastery curves
* Reality: Shallow mechanics, quickly mastered
* Mismatch: Marketed to dedicated, designed for casual
* Result: Dedicated players leave ("beaten in 10 hours, nothing left")

**Design principles for investment matching:**

1. **Be honest about investment level required**
   * Don't market deep games as casual
   * Don't promise "5-minute sessions" if mastery requires hours
   * Players appreciate honesty

2. **Design for a specific energy state, not all states**
   * Trying to serve exhausted AND dedicated = serving neither well
   * Better to excellently serve one state than poorly serve all

3. **Provide clear investment expectations**
   * How long is a session?
   * How much attention needed?
   * Can I pause/save anytime?
   * What's the learning curve?

4. **Match payoff to investment demanded**
   * High investment → must deliver deep payoff
   * Low investment → deliver immediate satisfaction
   * Mismatch creates resentment

5. **Consider same player, different times**
   * The dedicated player at 10pm is exhausted parent at 6am
   * Systems can offer multiple modes (casual and hardcore)
   * But each mode must match investment to payoff

**Integration with flow theory:**

Flow state requirements DEPEND on energy state:

* Exhausted player: Flow happens quickly (1-2 minutes) with simple challenges
* Dedicated player: Flow takes longer (5-10 minutes) but sustains longer with complex challenges
* Same challenge level feels different based on energy state
* Design flow curves for your target energy state

**Testing for investment/payoff match:**

Ask playtesters:

* "How tired were you when you played?"
* "Did this feel like the right amount of effort?"
* "Was the payoff worth the investment?"
* "Would you play this again in the same energy state?"

Mismatches show up clearly:

* "This is great but I need to be fully alert" (too demanding)
* "This is boring, I want deeper mechanics" (insufficient payoff)
* "I was exhausted and this stressed me out" (wrong target state)

## Part 7: Common Design Mistakes

Understanding common failures helps avoid them.

**1. Starting with Mechanics Instead of Purpose**

**Symptom:** "I have this cool dice mechanic! What game should I make?"

**Result:** Solution looking for problem. Mechanics don't serve purpose because purpose came second.

**Example:** D\&D 4e started with "balanced powers system" without asking "does this serve D\&D's purpose?"

**Fix:** Start with experience goal, then design mechanics to create it.

**2. Feature Creep and Unmotivated Complexity**

**Symptom:** "This system needs more depth! Add crafting! Add factions! Add weather!"

**Result:** System becomes baroque. Unmotivated complexity becomes tedium.

**Example:** D\&D 3.5e's feat chains. Technically deep, but optimization became burden, not joy.

**Fix:** Every system must serve the core experience. If you can't connect it back, cut it.

**3. Ignoring Parameters**

**Symptom:** Designers focus on mechanics and ignore tuning. "The game feels off but the mechanics are right."

**Result:** Parameters are wrong. Same mechanic, wrong configuration.

**Example:** Resource scarcity too low → nothing threatens you → tension gone. Could be fixed by parameter change, not mechanics redesign.

**Fix:** Before redesigning mechanics, try tuning parameters: scarcity, speed, pressure, limits, recovery.

**4. Treating Context as Cosmetic**

**Symptom:** "We'll add story/flavor later."

**Result:** Context should frame what mechanics mean. Without it, mechanics are abstract, unfelt.

**Example:** Same card game with "researching magic" theme vs. "managing resources" theme feels completely different.

**Fix:** Choose context first. It determines what mechanics mean.

**5. Violating Core Identity**

**Symptom:** Trying to fix problems by changing fundamental nature.

**Result:** You alienate core audience. See D\&D 4e.

**Example:** "Barbarians feel weak compared to spellcasters" → "Let's give everyone powers" → Now barbarians are spellcasters, which isn't what players wanted.

**Fix:** Know what your system IS. Problems should be solved within identity, not by violating it.

**6. No Feedback Loop**

**Symptom:** Players can't understand causality. Why did they lose? What would work better?

**Result:** Frustration. Players can't improve. Retention plummets.

**Example:** Opaque mechanics without explanation. (Exception: Cultist Simulator does this intentionally as discovery mechanic)

**Fix:** Most games need clear feedback. Players should understand cause and effect.

**7. Wrong Investment Level for Audience**

**Symptom:** Designed for exhausted casual players, but demands high-attention play. Or promised depth for dedicated players but delivered shallow mechanics.

**Result:** Energy state mismatch. Game is wonderful for wrong audience, miserable for target audience.

**Example:** Complex optimization-heavy game marketed as "relaxing cozy game" - exhausted players bounce off. Or "hardcore strategy game" that's mastered in 10 hours - dedicated players leave disappointed.

**Fix:**

* Know your audience's target energy state
* Design investment level to match
* Be honest in marketing about what you demand
* Match payoff to investment required
* Don't try to serve all energy states equally

**8. Exploitation Over Engagement (Ethical Failure)**

**Symptom:** Using psychological manipulation to extract time/money rather than create genuine enjoyment.

**Result:** Short-term metrics improve, long-term trust destroyed. Players feel used, not entertained.

**Examples of dark patterns:**

* Punishing missed login streaks without forgiveness mechanics (creating anxiety, not motivation)
* Deliberately confusing monetization (hiding real costs, exploiting cognitive biases)
* Endless engagement hooks designed to prevent stopping (no natural endpoints)
* Preying on FOMO (fear of missing out) with limited-time pressure tactics

**Why this fails:**

* Violates player trust and wellbeing
* Creates resentment, not loyalty
* Damages reputation and community
* Ethically indefensible even if profitable

**Good design alternative:**

* Streak freezes and rest days (respect player autonomy)
* Clear value propositions (transparent costs and benefits)
* Natural session endings (respecting player time)
* Optional FOMO, not mandatory (events are bonuses, not punishments for absence)

**The fundamental principle: Design should enhance players' lives, not exploit their psychology.**

**Fix:** Engagement should make players feel good about their time spent. If players feel manipulated, you've failed ethically even if you've succeeded commercially. Respect player time, money, and wellbeing.

**9. Incoherent Configuration**

**Symptom:** Feels like different games stapled together. Players confused about what matters. Mechanics say one thing, context says another.

**Result:** Players don't know what the system wants them to do. Experience feels inconsistent.

**Example:** D\&D 4e - mechanics said "tactical board game," context said "D\&D RPG," players got confused.

**Fix:** Everything must serve the same aesthetic. If something doesn't fit, cut it or change it. Configuration is where system emerges from mechanics.

**10. Ignoring Pacing**

**Symptom:** Early game great, late game tedious. No peaks and valleys (constant intensity burns out). Wrong rhythm for context (horror needs breathing room).

**Result:** Players engage early, quit when pacing breaks.

**Example:** Civ IV late game micromanagement tedium. Same intensity for 4 hours causes burnout.

**Fix:** Pacing transforms mechanics. Same combat system feels different at different pacing. Design escalation curves, rest cycles, pressure valves.

**11. Building for Wrong Aesthetic (System Selection Error)**

**Symptom:** Using a system designed for one aesthetic to deliver a different aesthetic.

**Result:** System functions don't support intended experience. Players follow mechanics over intended fiction.

**Example:** Using D\&D 5e for mystery investigation.

**Why it fails:**

| What Mystery Needs                             | What D\&D Provides            | Result                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Information management (core clues guaranteed) | Roll-to-find (can miss clues) | Investigation stalls                 |
| Investigation mechanics                        | Combat mechanics              | Players solve problems with violence |
| Detective character focus                      | Generic adventurer creation   | Incompatible characters allowed      |
| Deduction as core loop                         | Combat as core loop           | Mechanics reward wrong behavior      |

**The problem isn't that D\&D is bad—it's that D\&D is designed for different aesthetic (heroic combat adventure, not intellectual deduction).**

**How to detect this mistake:**

**Step 1: Identify required system functions for your aesthetic**

For mystery aesthetic:

* Information management (critical)
* State persistence (for continuity)
* Character-aesthetic alignment (investigators only)

**Step 2: Check if chosen system provides these functions**

D\&D 5e for mystery:

* Information management: ❌ (roll-to-find breaks flow)
* State persistence: ⚠️ (manual notes only)
* Character-aesthetic alignment: ❌ (allows any character type)

**Verdict:** 2 of 3 critical functions missing/broken. Wrong system.

**Step 3: Evaluate configuration coherence**

Ask: "Do mechanics align with intended context?"

* D\&D mechanics: Combat, tactical positioning, resource management
* Mystery context: Investigation, deduction, clue interpretation
* Result: ❌ Incoherent (combat mechanics in investigation context)

**Step 4: Predict player behavior**

Players follow what mechanics reward, not what context suggests:

* D\&D rewards: Violence, tactical positioning, resource optimization
* Mystery needs: Investigation, deduction, careful questioning
* Prediction: Players will solve mysteries through violence (killing suspects, looting clues from corpses)
* Observed: Exactly this happens in play

**Fix: Choose system that matches aesthetic**

**Option 1: Use purpose-built system**

* Mystery aesthetic → Gumshoe (or similar)
* Tactical combat → D\&D, Pathfinder
* Social intrigue → Burning Wheel, PbtA social games
* Horror → Call of Cthulhu, Dread

**Option 2: Heavily modify system**

* Replace broken functions (new information management rules)
* Restrict character creation (only investigators)
* Add missing mechanics (investigation system)
* Warning: This is essentially designing new system

**Option 3: Acknowledge constraints, design around them**

* Accept system limitations
* Use strengths (D\&D combat for action scenes)
* Work within constraints (mysteries as side content, not main focus)
* Set appropriate expectations

**When you MUST use wrong system (brand requirements, player investment):**

Be explicit about limitations:

* "This system isn't designed for mystery, so we'll house-rule investigation"
* "Combat will appear more than typical mystery game because that's what system does well"
* "Your characters should be combat-capable investigators, not pure detectives"

Supplement heavily:

* Add information management rules
* Create investigation subsystem
* Provide character creation guidance
* Use LLM to compensate for missing functions

**Framework principle:**

> Systems are designed for specific aesthetics. Using a system for different aesthetic is like using hammer for screws—technically possible but frustrating. Choose the right tool, or design a new one.

**Test:** For each critical function your aesthetic requires, verify your chosen system provides it. If 2+ critical functions are missing or broken, you need a different system.

## Part 8: Resources as System Elements

Resources aren't just "what you manage." They're **systemic indicators of what matters.**

**What you track = what matters in the game.**

### Examples

**D\&D:**

* HP (survival pressure)
* Spell slots (tactical decisions for casters)
* Action economy (what you can accomplish per turn)
* Gold/treasure (reward motivation)
* Each resource serves a purpose

**Civilization:**

* Production (what cities build)
* Gold (economic power)
* Science (technological advancement)
* Culture (expansion and victory)
* Faith (religious influence)
* Each resource is a victory path

**PbtA (varies by game):**

* Apocalypse World: Barter (survival economy)
* Monsterhearts: Strings (social leverage)
* Masks: Influence (independence struggle)
* Each resource tells you what game is about

**Key insight:** Don't track things just because they're realistic. Track what creates meaningful decisions.

### Resource Management Over Time

Different games create different pacing through resources:

**D\&D adventuring day:** Multiple encounters deplete resources → rest fully recovers → repeats. Creates "raid economy" pacing.

**Civilization:** City production compounds (more cities → more production → faster growth). Creates "snowball economy" pacing with catch-up mechanics (diplomatic penalties on warmongers, cultural pressure on weak civilizations).

**PbtA:** Resources often immediate (7-9 results are complications, not resource pools). Creates "narrative momentum" pacing.

## Part 9: The Future: What LLMs Change

Large Language Models don't create new design principles, but they enable what was previously impossible:

**What becomes feasible:**

* Emergent narrative (LLM tracks context, generates contextual situations)
* Dynamic difficulty (LLM adjusts based on player performance)
* Natural language mechanics (players describe intent, LLM adjudicates)
* Personalized content (LLM customizes systems to player choices)
* Complex state tracking (LLM maintains intricate world state)

**What must be preserved:**

* Player agency (LLM generates context, players decide)
* Dice rolling ritual (uncertainty, tension)
* Transparency (players understand outcomes)
* Design intent (LLM follows principles, not just generates)

**The trap:** "We can automate everything, so let's automate everything." This kills what makes games work: player agency, meaningful decisions, anticipation.

**The opportunity:** Use LLM to hide complexity, present simple choices. Players experience coherent world without needing to understand the back-end.

**LLM Opportunities by System Type:**

**For Challenge Games (D\&D, XCOM):**

* Dynamic difficulty balancing
* Complex enemy AI that learns
* State tracking for consequences
* But: preserve fairness, clarity, player skill expression

**For Narrative Games (PbtA, FATE, Weather Factory):**

* Natural language move identification
* Collaborative worldbuilding support
* Maintaining consistency in emergent fiction
* Following GM principles invisibly

**For Progression Games (Civ, D\&D):**

* Complex economic simulation
* Faction behavior and world state
* Optimization assistance (without removing decisions)
* But: preserve "one more turn" compulsion

**For Mystery Games (Cultist Simulator):**

* Consistent secrets and clues
* Fair-play mystery guarantee
* Breadcrumb generation
* But: preserve discovery satisfaction

**Design Principles for LLM-Enabled Systems:**

1. **Use LLM for complexity, present simplicity**
   * LLM tracks complex state, presents clean choices to players
   * Civ VI approach: complex back-end, clear UI

2. **Automate tedium, not decisions**
   * Bookkeeping: yes
   * Interesting choices: no
   * Players need meaningful decisions

3. **Make adaptation transparent**
   * Don't hide difficulty adjustment
   * Explain why outcomes happened
   * Maintain causality understanding

4. **Preserve rituals and agency**
   * Dice rolling matters
   * Character creation matters
   * Don't automate everything just because you can

5. **Follow principles, not scripts**
   * PbtA GM Agenda/Principles
   * FATE's "Be a fan of the characters"
   * Let LLM maintain aesthetic consistently

6. **Enable, don't replace**
   * LLM as co-GM, not replacement
   * LLM as tool, not oracle
   * Players and humans still central

## Part 10: System Functions - What Systems Actually Do

Beyond structural components (mechanics, parameters, context, pacing, configuration), game systems perform specific **functions**—work that enables experiences. Understanding these functions helps designers address real play needs.

### Function 1: Adjudication (Resolving Uncertainty)

**What it does:** Determines outcomes when results are uncertain. Answers "what happens?"

**Why it matters:** Without adjudication, play stalls or devolves into argument.

**Mechanisms:**

* Dice/randomizers (D\&D's d20, PbtA's 2d6)
* GM fiat (GM decides what happens)
* Player negotiation (group consensus)
* LLM interpretation (natural language → outcome)
* Algorithmic resolution (computer calculates)

**Design considerations:**

* **Transparency:** Do players understand why outcomes occurred?
* **Speed:** How quickly can you adjudicate?
* **Fairness:** Do outcomes feel earned or arbitrary?
* **Authority:** Who/what has final say?

**Examples:**

**D\&D:** Dice + modifier vs DC (transparent, fast, GM has authority to override)

**Apocalypse World:** 2d6 + stat, 10+/7-9/6- (transparent, instant, GM interprets 6- and 7-9 results)

**Amber Diceless RPG:** Pure GM adjudication based on character attributes (opaque but fast, GM has total authority)

**LLM opportunity:** Natural language adjudication without prescripted rules. Player says "I want to convince the guard," LLM considers character stats, situation, and generates outcome. Challenge: maintaining fairness and transparency.

### Function 2: Information Management (Controlling What Players Know)

**What it does:** Determines when information is revealed, hidden, or gated. Controls discovery pacing.

**Why it matters:** Many experiences (mystery, exploration, horror) depend on information flow. Systems must manage:

* What players know vs. don't know
* When they learn critical information
* How they access gated information
* What happens if they miss information

**Critical insight for system design:** Information is a resource like HP or gold. Design when it's scarce, when it's abundant, how it's earned, and what it costs.

**Mechanisms:**

* Hidden information (GM keeps secrets)
* Gradual revelation (clues distributed over time)
* Gated discovery (must accomplish X to learn Y)
* Player investigation (active search reveals info)
* Automatic distribution (core information guaranteed)

**Design considerations:**

* **Pacing:** When should players learn things?
* **Gating:** What must they do to earn information?
* **Fairness:** Can players get stuck without info they need?
* **Agency:** Do players feel they discovered vs were told?

**Two approaches to critical information:**

**Traditional RPG Model (D\&D):**

* All information gated by player action + dice rolls
* Missing information = investigation stalls
* GM must improvise or railroad to maintain progress
* Problem: Core information can be missed

**Mystery Game Model (Gumshoe):**

* Distinguish core information (necessary) from optional (enrichment)
* Core information: Automatically found when investigating relevant locations
* Optional information: Requires resource expenditure or special circumstances
* Solution: Progress guaranteed, challenge shifts to interpretation

**Examples:**

**Gumshoe (mystery games):**
Core clues distributed automatically when in right location with right skill. Additional clues cost investigation points. Ensures forward progress while rewarding thorough investigation.

**Blades in the Dark:**
Flashbacks let players reveal information retroactively ("Actually, I prepared for this earlier..."). Information emerges through play, not pre-planning.

**Cultist Simulator:**
Extreme opacity. Information must be discovered through experimentation. Frustrating for some, deeply satisfying for others. Intentional design choice.

**Traditional D\&D:**
GM holds all secrets, players must ask right questions. Can lead to "guess what the GM is thinking" frustration. Information management is GM burden, not system function.

**LLM opportunity:**

* Consistent world state (remembers what players know vs don't know)
* Fair-play mystery generation (clues are logically consistent)
* Adaptive revelation (adjusts pacing based on player progress)
* Dynamic redistribution (core information appears wherever players investigate)
* Challenge: Avoiding railroading, preserving player agency in discovery

**Design questions for your system:**

1. What information is critical for players to progress?
2. How do you ensure they can't miss critical information?
3. What information is enrichment vs. necessary?
4. How do you make discovery feel earned, not given?
5. What happens if players investigate unexpected directions?

**Test:** If players can miss information necessary for progress and investigation stalls, your information management function is broken.

### Function 3: Content Generation (Creating New Situations)

**What it does:** Produces scenarios, encounters, NPCs, locations that players haven't seen before.

**Why it matters:** Without content generation, games end when prepared material runs out.

**Mechanisms:**

* Pre-authored content (published adventures, finite scenarios)
* GM improvisation (human creativity on the fly)
* Procedural generation (algorithms create content)
* Random tables (roll dice, consult table, combine results)
* LLM generation (contextual content creation)
* Player contribution (collaborative worldbuilding)

**Design considerations:**

* **Coherence:** Does new content fit existing fiction?
* **Quality:** Is generated content interesting/playable?
* **Surprise:** Does it create novelty or feel repetitive?
* **Control:** Who determines what gets generated?

**Examples:**

**Pre-authored (D\&D modules):** High quality, finite quantity. When module ends, campaign might end.

**GM improvisation:** Infinite but quality varies, requires skilled GM, can be exhausting.

**Dwarf Fortress (procedural):** Generates entire worlds, histories, characters. Coherent but sometimes absurd. Infinite replayability.

**Ironsworn (solo RPG):** Oracle tables answer questions ("Is the NPC hostile?" → roll → "Yes, and..."). Player interprets results into fiction.

**LLM opportunity:**

* Generate coherent NPCs, locations, situations on demand
* Maintain consistency with established facts
* Adapt content to player choices and history
* Create surprising but appropriate complications
* Challenge: Avoiding generic/repetitive content, preserving authorial voice

**Critical distinction:**

* **Authored content:** Finite but high quality, requires preparation
* **Procedural content:** Infinite but potentially shallow/incoherent
* **LLM content:** Potentially infinite AND coherent, but requires careful prompting/constraints

### Function 4: State Persistence (Remembering Across Time)

**What it does:** Maintains continuity across sessions, remembers consequences, tracks campaign state.

**Why it matters:** Without persistence, each session feels disconnected, choices don't matter.

**Mechanisms:**

* Written notes (players/GM record events)
* Character sheets (track mechanical state)
* Campaign logs (session summaries, wiki)
* Shared documents (collaborative world tracking)
* Computer saves (perfect state preservation)
* LLM memory (contextual state tracking)

**Design considerations:**

* **What to remember:** Everything (overwhelming) or highlights (lossy)?
* **Who remembers:** GM, players, system, everyone?
* **Cost of forgetting:** Does forgotten info break game?
* **Re-engagement:** How do you remind players what matters?

**Examples:**

**D\&D traditional:** GM takes notes, players remember character details. Works for weekly play, fails for monthly gaps.

**West Marches (sandbox campaign):** Player-maintained wiki. Persistence distributed among group. Works because many players contribute.

**Blades in the Dark:** Faction status tracked mechanically. Heat, Rep, Coin carry forward. Clear what persists.

**Video games:** Perfect mechanical persistence, but often poor narrative continuity (NPC repeats same dialogue).

**LLM opportunity:**

* Remember NPC personalities, relationships, promises made
* Track world state changes (town burned down, king overthrown)
* Generate contextual recaps ("Last time, you offended the duchess...")
* Maintain long-term consequences without note-taking burden
* Challenge: What detail level to maintain? Everything = overwhelming, too little = feels disconnected

**Critical insight for infrequent play:**

* System must support re-engagement (efficient recap)
* Mechanical state should be simple enough to remember
* Context should be rich enough to reconnate quickly
* "What happened last time?" should take minutes, not half the session

### Function 5: Cognitive Encoding (Shaping How Players Think)

**What it does:** Mechanics encode assumptions, worldviews, psychological models. Makes players think in specific ways.

**Why it matters:** To create alien experiences, explore perspectives, challenge assumptions.

**Mechanisms:**

* Stat choices (what attributes exist defines what matters)
* Action verbs (what you can do shapes how you approach problems)
* Resource constraints (scarcity creates specific mindsets)
* Victory conditions (goals shape strategies)
* Failure consequences (risk tolerance)

**Design considerations:**

* **Intentionality:** Are you encoding deliberately or accidentally?
* **Transparency:** Do players recognize the encoding?
* **Effect:** Does it actually change thinking or just describe?
* **Constraints:** What becomes impossible to think/do?

**Examples:**

**D\&D:** Six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) encode assumption that these are fundamental human qualities. Problems get framed in these terms.

**Apocalypse World:** Stats are Hard, Hot, Sharp, Cool, Weird - not traditional attributes. Frames actions differently ("I'm going to be hot at them" vs "I use my Charisma").

**Monsterhearts:** Stats are constantly shifting Labels (Hot, Cold, Volatile, Dark). Identity is fluid, not fixed. Players experience unstable teen identity.

**Alien cognition example:**

* Species that experiences time non-linearly: mechanics allow "remembering" future events, "planning" past events
* Species without individual identity: resources are collective, actions are collaborative by default, "I" doesn't exist mechanically
* Species that perceives only relationships: no absolute positions, only "near X" or "between Y and Z"

**LLM opportunity:**

* Enforce alien cognition consistently
* Generate appropriate responses to alien actions
* Maintain internal logic of non-human psychology
* Adjudicate actions within different cognitive framework
* Challenge: LLMs trained on human text may default to human thinking

**Critical insight:** Mechanics don't just resolve actions—they define what actions are possible, what questions get asked, how problems get framed.

### Function 6: Constraint Design (Creating Satisfying Limitations)

**What it does:** Imposes restrictions that make choices meaningful and success satisfying.

**Why it matters:** Without constraints, there's no challenge, no strategy, no accomplishment.

**Mechanisms:**

* Resource limits (can't do everything)
* Action limits (can't act infinitely)
* Information limits (can't know everything)
* Power limits (can't solve all problems one way)
* Social limits (must work with/around others)

**Design considerations:**

* **Tightness:** How constrained are players?
* **Type:** What kind of limitation (resources, actions, knowledge)?
* **Satisfaction:** Do constraints create interesting choices or frustration?
* **Purpose:** What does the constraint force players to do/think about?

**Examples:**

**XCOM:** 2 actions per turn. Forces choice: move and shoot? Double move? Overwatch? Constraint creates tactical depth.

**Blades in the Dark:** Limited stress before trauma, limited downtime actions. Can't do everything, must prioritize.

**Subtle powers scenario:** Powers are useful but can't be revealed publicly. Constraint: solve problems without exposing abilities. Makes players creative.

**D\&D spell slots:** Finite daily magic. Constraint: when to use powerful spells? Creates resource management tension.

**LLM opportunity:**

* Enforce subtle constraints consistently (powers can't be obvious)
* Generate situations that test constraints
* Reward working within limitations
* Make constraints feel like features, not bugs
* Challenge: LLMs may suggest breaking constraints unless carefully prompted

**Critical insight:** Constraints aren't bugs to be removed—they're features that create gameplay. Well-designed constraints make players feel clever when they work within them.

### Function 7: Procedural Content for Solo Play (GM-less Generation)

**What it does:** Enables play without human GM through oracles, procedures, and decision frameworks.

**Why it matters:** Solo play, GM-less groups, asynchronous play all need non-human adjudication.

**Mechanisms:**

* Oracle tables (answer yes/no questions, generate complications)
* Random encounter tables (determine what happens)
* Decision flowcharts (structured procedures)
* Mythic GME (complex oracle system)
* LLM as oracle (natural language question → contextual answer)

**Design considerations:**

* **Authority:** What can oracle decide vs player?
* **Surprise:** Must generate unexpected results
* **Coherence:** Must fit established fiction
* **Agency:** Player still makes meaningful choices
* **Interpretation:** How much player interpretation required?

**Examples:**

**Ironsworn:** Ask oracle yes/no questions. Roll dice, consult table: "Yes, and..." "No, but..." Player interprets into fiction.

**Mythic GME:** Complex oracle system. Chaos Factor adjusts probability. Scene framing, NPC actions, complications all generated.

**Four Against Darkness:** Pure procedural dungeon generation. Room type determined by dice, contents by tables. No interpretation needed.

**Thousand Year Old Vampire:** Prompted journaling. Game poses questions, player writes answers. Emergent narrative from prompts.

**LLM opportunity:**

* Natural language oracles ("Is the shopkeeper suspicious?" → contextual answer)
* Generate coherent NPCs with personalities
* Maintain world consistency without player tracking
* Complex situation generation (not just "you encounter...")
* Adjudicate action outcomes fairly
* Challenge: Preserving player agency, avoiding railroading, maintaining surprise

**Critical insight:** Solo systems need different design than GM-ed systems. Oracle must be:

* Specific enough to be useful
* Vague enough to allow interpretation
* Surprising but not incoherent
* Authoritative but not controlling

### Integration: Functions Work Together

**Example: Mystery Investigation System**

1. **Adjudication:** How do you determine if investigation succeeds? (Gumshoe: auto-success for core clues, roll for extra)

2. **Information Management:** When are clues revealed? How are they gated? (Gumshoe: core clues always found, spend points for extras)

3. **Content Generation:** How are mysteries created? (Pre-authored scenarios, or LLM generates coherent clues on the fly)

4. **State Persistence:** What clues have players found? What leads are active? (Written notes, or LLM tracks)

5. **Cognitive Encoding:** Not typically relevant for mystery unless encoding detective mindset

6. **Constraint Design:** Limited investigation resources create meaningful choices about what to pursue

7. **Solo Play:** Oracle answers "is this person lying?" or "what do you find in the drawer?"

**A complete system addresses all relevant functions, not just resolution mechanics.**

## Part 11: Designer Responsibility - The Meta-Level

Game systems are not neutral. They create experiences that affect players emotionally, psychologically, and socially. Designers have responsibilities beyond "does this work mechanically?"

### The Purpose-First Principle

**From "Games as Experiential Scaffolds":**

Games are **purpose-built structures** that enable experiences people couldn't otherwise access. The scaffold isn't the point—what it enables players to understand, feel, or explore is the point.

**This reframes design from:**

* "What's fun?" → "What experience do we want to create?"
* "What's entertaining?" → "What should players understand/feel/explore?"
* "What's cool?" → "What purpose does this serve?"

**Design questions:**

1. What experience am I trying to create?
2. Why does this experience matter?
3. Who is this experience for?
4. Am I the right person to create this?
5. Could this experience cause harm?

### When to Design (Matching Purpose to Capability)

**Design when:**

**You have relevant knowledge/experience:**

* Personal experience with the subject matter
* Extensive research and consultation
* Lived experience of the perspectives represented
* Technical expertise to execute well

**Examples:**

* Designing game about academic pressure? You've been a student.
* Designing game about running a business? You've run a business or deeply researched.
* Designing tactical combat? You understand tactics or study extensively.

**The purpose serves a real need:**

* Players want to understand something (explore ethical dilemmas)
* Players want to feel something (experience triumph, loss, mystery)
* Players want to learn something (historical events, system thinking)
* Players want to connect (social bonding, shared experience)

**You can execute responsibly:**

* You have the technical skill
* You have time/resources to do it well
* You can test with appropriate audiences
* You can handle feedback and iterate

### When NOT to Design (Recognizing Boundaries)

**Don't design when:**

**You lack essential knowledge:**

* Designing experiences you haven't lived or deeply studied
* Representing perspectives you don't understand
* Creating systems for contexts you haven't researched

**Example failures:**

* "Game about depression" by designer who's never experienced it → trivializes serious condition
* "Medieval realism" by designer who hasn't studied history → reinforces myths
* "Alien psychology" with zero thought about cognition → humans in rubber suits

**The subject requires lived experience:**

**Some topics you should not design without:**

* Personal lived experience of that identity/condition
* Extensive consultation with people who have that experience
* Deep expertise (years of study, not surface research)
* Understanding of community norms and concerns

**Examples:**

* Games about specific marginalized experiences (racism, disability, LGBTQ+ issues, poverty, trauma)
* Games about mental health conditions
* Games about specific cultural practices
* Games about serious historical tragedies

**This is not censorship.** It's recognizing that some stories require insider knowledge to tell responsibly.

**When consulted by people with lived experience:**

* Listen more than you speak
* Defer to their expertise
* Pay them for their time and knowledge
* Give them veto power over representation
* Credit them appropriately

**The purpose could cause harm:**

**Red flags:**

* Trivializes serious suffering
* Exploits trauma for entertainment
* Reinforces harmful stereotypes
* Punches down (mocks vulnerable people)
* Glorifies harm without critique
* Violates community trust

**Examples to avoid:**

* "Game about school shootings" (trivializes tragedy)
* "Play as slaveholder" (without serious historical/educational purpose)
* "Mental illness as game mechanic" (stigmatizes conditions)
* "Poverty simulator" that treats suffering as aesthetic

**You can't execute responsibly:**

* You don't have the skill
* You don't have the time to do it well
* You don't have access to appropriate testers
* You're not willing to be wrong and iterate
* You're not willing to abandon the project if it doesn't work

### Character Creation as Aesthetic Filter

**Insight:** Character creation is not neutral toolset—it's the first enforcement point of aesthetic requirements.

**The Problem:**

Some game aesthetics require specific character types or mindsets:

* Mystery requires characters who care about solving puzzles and being correct
* Collaborative storytelling requires characters who enable other players' stories
* Competitive games require characters who engage with competitive frameworks
* Horror requires characters capable of vulnerability

Generic character creation allows players to build characters incompatible with intended aesthetic. This breaks the system regardless of mechanical quality.

**Real Example (Mystery):**

**What happened:** Player created "cowardly warrior focused on survival and payment" for mystery game.

**Why this broke the aesthetic:**

* Mystery aesthetic requires caring about "being correct" (intellectual vindication)
* Character cared about "getting paid and surviving" (pragmatic completion)
* Red herrings (essential mystery element) had no meaning:
  * For detective: Following false lead = wasted time = failure
  * For cowardly warrior: Following false lead = still got paid = success
* Character was well-designed, just wrong game

**The system can't fix this.** No mechanics can force a player to care about solving mysteries correctly if their character doesn't care.

**Solution: Filter Through Character Creation**

**Principle:** Character creation should guide players toward characters that enable the intended aesthetic, not allow infinite options.

**Implementation approaches:**

**1. Limited Archetypes (Restrictive)**

* Provide only character types compatible with aesthetic
* Mystery game: Detective, Researcher, Reporter, Forensic Expert
* No option to create incompatible types
* Pros: Guarantees fit, clear expectations
* Cons: Feels restrictive, reduces player freedom

**2. Mandatory Drives/Motivations (Guided)**

* All characters must have mechanical motivation aligned with aesthetic
* Mystery game: Every character has "Drive" (why they solve mysteries)
* Drive provides mechanical benefits when pursuing aesthetic
* Examples: "Protect innocent," "Uncover truth," "Advance career," "Prove yourself"
* Pros: Ensures investment, maintains some freedom
* Cons: Requires careful design of drives

**3. Explicit Requirements (Educational)**

* Character creation clearly states: "This game requires X type of character"
* Explains why certain types won't work
* Provides examples of appropriate vs. inappropriate
* Trusts players to self-select
* Pros: Maintains freedom, educates players
* Cons: Some players will ignore guidance

**Which approach to use:**

```
IF aesthetic requires specific mindset (mystery, collaborative story)
  THEN use Limited Archetypes or Mandatory Drives

IF aesthetic is flexible but has constraints (heroic fantasy, space opera)
  THEN use Explicit Requirements with examples

IF aesthetic serves multiple playstyles (sandbox, traditional dungeon crawl)
  THEN generic creation works (no aesthetic that requires filtering)
```

**Design questions:**

1. Does my aesthetic require specific character mindset?
2. What character types break the intended aesthetic?
3. How restrictive should filtering be?
4. How do I make restrictions feel liberating (focused options) not limiting (removed freedom)?

**Framework principle:**

> Character creation is not about maximizing player freedom. It's about ensuring players can engage with the intended aesthetic. Sometimes the best design restricts options to only those that create satisfying play.

**Test:** If players can create characters that break your intended aesthetic, your character creation is too broad.

### The Ethical Decision Framework

**When considering a design, ask:**

**1. Purpose Check**

* What experience am I trying to create?
* Why does this experience matter?
* Who benefits from this experience?
* What harm could this experience cause?

**2. Knowledge Check**

* Do I have the knowledge/experience to design this?
* Have I done sufficient research?
* Do I need to consult with others?
* Am I the right person for this project?

**3. Representation Check**

* Who am I representing in this game?
* Do I have the right to represent these people/experiences?
* Have I consulted with people with lived experience?
* Am I reinforcing stereotypes or challenging them?

**4. Harm Check**

* Could this trivialize suffering?
* Could this reinforce harmful stereotypes?
* Could this trigger or retraumatize players?
* Am I punching down (mocking vulnerable people)?

**5. Execution Check**

* Can I do this well?
* Do I have time/resources?
* Can I test appropriately?
* Am I willing to be wrong and change?
* Am I willing to abandon if it doesn't work?

**If any answer is "no" or "I don't know," STOP and reassess.**

### Examples: Ethical Decision Making

**Scenario: Designer wants to create "Game About Depression"**

**Purpose Check:**

* Experience: Help players understand depression
* Why: Reduce stigma, build empathy
* Who benefits: People who haven't experienced depression, maybe people with depression who see themselves represented

**Knowledge Check:**

* Designer has not experienced clinical depression
* Designer has read articles about depression
* Designer has not consulted mental health professionals
* Designer has not consulted people with lived experience

**STOP HERE.** Designer lacks essential knowledge and lived experience.

**Ethical path forward:**

* Option 1: Don't make this game (recognize limits)
* Option 2: Collaborate with people with lived experience (co-design)
* Option 3: Hire consultant with lived experience (pay them, credit them, give them veto power)
* Option 4: Design about something you DO understand

**NOT acceptable:**

* "I'll just research online" (insufficient)
* "My friend has depression, that counts" (no)
* "It's just a game, it doesn't matter" (it does)

**Scenario: Designer wants "Mystery Game Set in Real Historical Event"**

**Purpose Check:**

* Experience: Explore historical mystery
* Why: Engage with history, puzzle-solving
* Who benefits: History enthusiasts, puzzle solvers

**Knowledge Check:**

* Designer has studied this historical period (5+ years)
* Designer has read primary sources
* Designer has consulted historians
* Designer understands historiographical debates

**Representation Check:**

* Historical period includes marginalized people
* Designer is not from those communities
* Designer has consulted with relevant communities
* Designer is committed to avoiding stereotypes

**Harm Check:**

* Historical event was tragic
* Game treats tragedy respectfully (not entertainment from suffering)
* Game has educational purpose
* Consulted people from affected communities approved

**PROCEED WITH CAUTION.** Designer has done the work, but must:

* Continue consulting
* Accept feedback and change
* Be willing to abandon if it doesn't work
* Credit consultants appropriately

**Scenario: Designer wants "Alien Psychology Game"**

**Purpose Check:**

* Experience: Think in non-human ways
* Why: Explore cognition, challenge assumptions
* Who benefits: Players who enjoy cognitive challenges

**Knowledge Check:**

* Designer studied cognitive science (yes)
* Designer understands different cognitive models (yes)
* Designer has thought deeply about alien cognition (yes)
* Designer can execute this technically (maybe)

**Representation Check:**

* Not representing real people (just hypothetical aliens)
* No marginalized groups being metaphored (checked carefully)

**Harm Check:**

* Low risk of harm (speculative thought experiment)
* Not trivializing real experiences
* Not reinforcing stereotypes

**PROCEED.** Designer has knowledge, purpose is clear, low risk of harm. Must still:

* Test extensively (does it actually create alien cognition or just describe it?)
* Be willing to iterate or abandon
* Avoid accidental metaphors for real marginalized groups

### Safety and Consent

**X-Card and Safety Tools:**

Even well-designed games can hit unexpected triggers or boundaries. Safety tools are essential:

**X-Card (John Stavropoulos):**

* Anyone can play the X-Card at any time
* No questions asked, no justification required
* Skip/rewind the scene
* Move on without discussion

**Lines and Veils (Ron Edwards):**

* Lines: Content we don't cross (not depicted at all)
* Veils: Content that happens "offscreen" (acknowledged but not detailed)
* Discussed before play
* Can be added during play

**Other tools:**

* Script Change (pause/rewind/fast-forward)
* Support Flower (signal comfort levels)
* Stars and Wishes (debrief tool)

**Designer responsibility:**

* Include safety tools in your game text
* Explain how to use them
* Model their use
* Normalize stopping when needed

**Why this matters:**

* Games create emotional experiences
* Not all players have same boundaries
* Consent is ongoing, not just at start
* Good design anticipates this

### The Willingness to Say No

**The most important ethical skill:**

Sometimes the right answer is "I shouldn't make this game."

**Reasons to say no:**

* You lack essential knowledge
* You lack lived experience
* You can't consult appropriately
* The purpose could cause harm
* You can't execute responsibly
* The topic requires insider perspective you don't have

**This is not failure.** This is wisdom.

**Better to:**

* Design something you CAN do well
* Support someone else who HAS the lived experience
* Learn more before attempting (maybe in 5 years)
* Recognize your limits

**The goal is not to make every game.** The goal is to make games that create valuable experiences without causing harm.

### Integration with System Design

**Ethical considerations affect every design decision:**

**Mechanics:** Do they trivialize suffering? Reinforce stereotypes? Create unintended messages?

**Parameters:** Does scarcity create meaningful tension or simulate real poverty insensitively?

**Context:** Does framing respect subject matter? Does tone match seriousness?

**Pacing:** Does rhythm respect player emotional capacity?

**Configuration:** Do all components work together to serve intended purpose ethically?

**Functions:**

* Does adjudication feel fair?
* Does information management respect player boundaries?
* Does content generation avoid harmful tropes?
* Does cognitive encoding challenge or reinforce biases?

**Purpose guides everything.** But purpose alone isn't enough. Execution must be responsible.

## Part 12: Research Notes and Open Hypotheses

This section documents insights that need further validation (hypotheses) and findings from scenario testing (validated results). Think of this as the "working notes" of framework development—claims that show promise but require more evidence, and results from testing the framework against real design problems.

### Hypotheses to Test

These propositions emerged from analyzing specific scenarios. They seem strong but need validation across multiple cases before integrating as framework principles.

#### Hypothesis 1: Agency Priority by Aesthetic

**Claim:** Different aesthetics require different agency sources as primary challenge.

**Proposed taxonomy:**

| Aesthetic Type                     | Primary Agency                   | Secondary Agency | Tertiary Agency  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Intellectual (deduction, puzzle)   | Interpretation                   | Scene Selection  | Action/Resources |
| Survival (danger, consequences)    | Action/Resources                 | Scene Selection  | Interpretation   |
| Horror (dread, scarcity)           | Resources                        | Interpretation   | Scene/Action     |
| Social (collaboration, fellowship) | Interpretation + Scene Selection | Action           | Resources        |

**Evidence so far:**

* ✓ Mystery investigation (Scenario 3): Interpretation primary, scene selection secondary, matches prediction
* ? Time-constrained play (Scenario 1): Untested—does time pressure change priority?
* ? Subtle powers (Scenario 4): Untested—does constraint change priority?
* ? Solo play (Scenario 5): Untested—how does absence of social dimension affect priority?

**What would validate:** If pattern holds across 3+ aesthetics with different characteristics.

**What would invalidate:** If different aesthetics show no consistent pattern, or if same aesthetic shows different priorities in different contexts.

**Design implications if validated:**

* Framework should explicitly state primary agency source for target aesthetic
* System design should make primary source most challenging and rewarding
* Secondary sources provide variety but shouldn't overshadow primary

**Why this matters:** Helps designers prioritize where to invest complexity and challenge. If interpretation is primary for your aesthetic, make that hard. If action is primary, make that hard. Don't try to make everything equally challenging.

**Testing approach:**

1. Analyze Scenarios 1, 4, 5 for agency priorities
2. Look for consistent patterns across aesthetic types
3. Check if same aesthetic in different contexts maintains priority
4. Build taxonomy only if pattern holds reliably

***

#### Hypothesis 2: Pacing Automation Spectrum

**Claim:** Pacing mechanisms exist on automation spectrum from fully mechanical to fully GM-driven, with trade-offs at each level.

**Proposed spectrum:**

**High Automation (Mechanical, Consistent):**

* Scene counters ("villain acts after scene 6")
* Clue thresholds ("when 4 clues found, Act 2 begins")
* Automatic resource depletion
* Pros: Consistent, fair, predictable, no GM skill required
* Cons: Inflexible, can feel mechanical, can't adapt to circumstances

**Medium Automation (Player-Influenced, Variable):**

* Complication tables (roll after each scene)
* Investigation point economy (players control pace through spending)
* Danger from actions (player choices trigger complications)
* Pros: Variable, player agency, some randomness, some consistency
* Cons: Can be too unpredictable, requires system design

**Low Automation (GM Judgment, Flexible):**

* GM decides when to escalate based on pace
* Complications introduced when dramatically appropriate
* Flexible adjustment to player progress
* Pros: Maximally flexible, can adapt perfectly, feels natural
* Cons: Requires skilled GM, inconsistent between GMs, can feel arbitrary

**Evidence so far:**

* ✓ Mystery pacing (Scenario 3): Proposed using scene counter (high) + point economy (medium) + LLM monitoring
* ? Time-constrained pacing (Scenario 1): Untested—does 2-hour session need high automation?
* ? Open-world pacing (Scenario 2 or others): Untested—does exploration need low automation?

**What would validate:** If different aesthetics consistently benefit from different automation levels.

**What would invalidate:** If automation level doesn't correlate with aesthetic success, or if same aesthetic works equally well at all levels.

**Design implications if validated:**

* Mystery/horror → High automation (consistent dread, fair investigation)
* Exploration/sandbox → Low automation (flexibility for player-driven discovery)
* Action/tactical → Medium automation (player choices matter, but structure exists)

**LLM consideration:** LLM could operate at medium automation level—monitoring pace, suggesting escalations, but GM approves. Combines consistency with flexibility.

**Why this matters:** Helps designers choose appropriate pacing mechanism for their aesthetic. Not all pacing is created equal—some aesthetics need predictability, others need flexibility.

**Testing approach:**

1. Design pacing for Scenarios 1, 4, 5 using different automation levels
2. Predict which level feels best for each aesthetic
3. Identify if patterns emerge (time pressure → high automation? exploration → low automation?)
4. Validate through play or detailed scenario analysis

***

#### Hypothesis 3: The 20/80 Preparation Problem

**Claim:** In exploratory games, GMs prep 100% of content, players engage with \~20%, creating waste and risk of missing critical content.

**Observed in:** Mystery investigation (Scenario 3) where player might investigate unexpected location (car dealer, victim's church) that GM hasn't prepped.

**Proposed problem structure:**

* GM preps Scene A, B, C, D, E
* Players investigate Scene A and C (20% of prep)
* Scenes B, D, E contain critical information
* Players never find it
* Investigation stalls or GM must railroad

**Traditional solutions:**

* Over-prep everything (exhausting, wasteful)
* Railroad players to prepped content (removes agency)
* Make all content non-critical (shallow investigation)
* Improvise everything (inconsistent, risky)

**LLM solution hypothesis:**

* LLM knows what information is critical (core clues)
* LLM generates content for any location player investigates
* LLM ensures core information appears in whatever 20% player engages with
* GM doesn't need to prep every possibility
* Player agency preserved (can investigate anything)

**Evidence so far:**

* ✓ Mystery (Scenario 3): Problem clearly identified, LLM solution proposed
* ? Does this problem appear in non-mystery contexts?
* ? Are there non-LLM solutions that work?
* ? Does LLM solution create new problems (generic content, loss of GM voice)?

**What would validate:** If problem appears in multiple exploratory aesthetics and no good non-LLM solution exists.

**What would invalidate:** If problem is mystery-specific, or if good non-LLM solutions exist (scene-agnostic content, player-driven structure).

**Alternative solutions to explore:**

* **Scene-agnostic content:** Design clues that fit any location ("You find evidence of X wherever you look")
* **Player-driven structure:** Players narrate what they find (Brindlewood Bay model)
* **Modular design:** Small content chunks that can be inserted anywhere
* **Minimal prep:** Only prep NPCs and core facts, improvise locations

**Why this matters:** If real problem with no good solution, LLM provides major value. If problem is rare or has good solutions, LLM is nice-to-have, not essential.

**Testing approach:**

1. Check if Scenarios 1, 2, 4, 5 have similar preparation problems
2. Identify other solutions beyond LLM
3. Determine if this is general exploratory problem or mystery-specific
4. Evaluate if LLM solution is viable (doesn't create worse problems)

***

#### Hypothesis 4: Red Herring Design Principle (Information Architecture)

**Claim:** False information works when distinguishable from true information through systematic difference.

**Mystery-specific pattern observed:**

* Real clues: Motive + Means + Opportunity (complete triangle)
* Red herrings: Missing one element of triangle (discoverable as incomplete)
* Players can identify false leads within 1-2 scenes of investigation

**Generalization question:** Does this principle extend beyond mystery?

**Possible broader principle:**

* True information: Forms complete logical chain (A → B → C → conclusion)
* False information: Missing link in chain (A → B → ??? → different conclusion)
* Players can discover the gap through investigation

**Testing in other contexts:**

* Horror: False dangers vs. real dangers—how to distinguish?
* Exploration: False leads vs. real discoveries—how to signal?
* Social intrigue: Lies vs. truth—what makes lies detectible?

**Evidence so far:**

* ✓ Mystery (Scenario 3): Pattern clearly works
* ? Does pattern apply to other information-driven aesthetics?
* ? Is this mystery-specific or general information design?

**What would validate:** If pattern appears in other aesthetics (horror false scares, exploration false leads) with similar structure.

**What would invalidate:** If pattern is mystery-specific and doesn't generalize to other information architectures.

**Design implications if validated:**

* General principle: Design false information with detectable gaps
* Players should be able to identify false through investigation
* False information shouldn't waste excessive time (1-2 scenes maximum)
* Vindication of correct identification should be satisfying

**Why this matters:** Information design is critical for many aesthetics. If there's a general principle for designing good false information, that's valuable beyond mystery.

**Testing approach:**

1. Analyze information structure in Scenarios 2 (alien cognition), 4 (subtle powers)
2. Look for false leads or misleading information
3. Check if "missing element" pattern applies
4. Determine if this is mystery-specific or generalizable

***

### Open Research Questions

These are deeper questions that emerged from analysis but require extensive study beyond scenario testing.

#### Question 1: Guaranteed Progress vs. Stakes Tension

**The dilemma:** Gumshoe guarantees finding core clues (progress guaranteed). Does this reduce stakes? Where should tension live if not in "will you find information?"

**Proposed alternative stakes:**

* Time pressure (deadline approaching)
* Resource depletion (running out of tools)
* Consequences (villain reacts to investigation)
* Danger (investigation is risky)
* Quality of solution (solve perfectly vs. adequately)

**Evidence so far:**

* Mixed player reactions to guaranteed progress (some love security, some find boring)
* Unclear if this applies to non-mystery aesthetics
* Need psychological research on types of stakes and engagement

**Research needed:**

1. Player psychology: What types of stakes create engagement?
2. Test guaranteed progress in multiple aesthetics
3. Measure player satisfaction with different stake types
4. Understand cultural/personal differences in stake preferences

**Why this matters:** Fundamental question about where uncertainty and tension should live in game systems. Affects design across many aesthetics.

***

#### Question 2: Character Investment That Systems Can't Force

**The insight:** Systems cannot force players to care about aesthetics they don't value.

**What systems can't force:**

* Caring about "being correct" (intellectual vindication)
* Caring about "collaborative story" (social investment)
* Caring about "competition" (competitive drive)
* Caring about "horror" (willingness to be scared)

**What systems can do:**

* Be explicit about required investment
* Filter through character creation
* Mechanically reward appropriate behavior
* Make inappropriate behavior unrewarding

**But the question remains:** Where's the line between "nudging" and "forcing"? How much can mechanical rewards shift player behavior?

**Research needed:**

1. Categorize types of player investment (intrinsic vs. extrinsic)
2. Determine which respond to mechanical incentives
3. Identify which require pre-existing player interest
4. Understand when mechanical rewards feel manipulative vs. supportive

**Why this matters:** Helps designers understand limits of system design. Can't solve every problem with mechanics. Some require right players, not right system.

***

#### Question 3: LLM Content Quality ("AI Slop" Problem)

**The concern:** LLM-generated content risks being generic, predictable, or unsatisfying ("AI slop").

**Quality dimensions:**

* Coherence (internally consistent)
* Novelty (surprising but believable)
* Character voice (NPCs feel distinct)
* Thematic consistency (matches setting tone)
* Satisfying payoffs (revelations feel earned)

**The question:** Can LLMs generate content that's satisfying, not just functional?

**Current state:**

* Coherence: LLMs handle well
* Novelty: Hit or miss (can be generic)
* Character voice: Requires careful prompting
* Thematic consistency: Requires strong system message
* Satisfying payoffs: Unclear, needs testing

**Research needed:**

1. Prototype LLM mystery generation
2. Test with real players for satisfaction
3. Identify quality thresholds and improvement methods
4. Compare human-authored vs. LLM-generated content
5. Determine when LLM is good enough vs. when human authorship essential

**Why this matters:** LLM enables new system functions, but only if content quality is acceptable. If generated content feels hollow, theoretical benefits don't matter.

**This is practical implementation problem, not design theory problem.** Depends on LLM capabilities (improving rapidly) and prompt engineering. Requires actual development and testing.

***

### Validated Findings from Scenario Testing

These findings emerged from scenario analysis and validate existing framework principles. They demonstrate the framework working correctly.

#### Finding 1: Configuration Coherence is Measurable (Scenario 3)

**Framework principle tested:** Part 2, Component 5 (Configuration)—"All components must work together toward same experience goal"

**Test case:** D\&D 5e for mystery investigation

**Analysis:**

* Mechanics: Combat, tactical positioning, resource optimization
* Context: Mystery investigation, deduction, clue interpretation
* Result: ❌ Incoherent configuration

**Observed player behavior:**

* Players defaulted to violence to solve information problems
* "If it has stats, you can kill it" → Loot clues from corpses
* Mechanics rewarded wrong behavior for mystery aesthetic

**Validation:** Configuration incoherence is real, measurable, and predicts player behavior.

**Framework implication:** Configuration coherence test works as diagnostic tool:

1. List mechanics and what they reward
2. State context and what it requires
3. Check alignment
4. If misaligned, predict players will follow mechanics over context
5. This prediction was confirmed in play

**Confidence:** High. This principle is validated and framework needs no changes.

***

#### Finding 2: Aesthetic-First Design Predicts Success (Scenario 3)

**Framework principle tested:** Part 4 (MDA)—"Start with aesthetics (experience goal), work backward to mechanics"

**Test case:** Gumshoe vs. D\&D for mystery

**Analysis:**

**Gumshoe (aesthetic-first):**

* Aesthetic goal: Intellectual deduction, fair-play mystery
* Designed mechanics: Automatic core clues, spend economy, progressive revelation
* Result: ✓ Mechanics serve aesthetic perfectly

**D\&D (mechanics-adapted):**

* Existing mechanics: Roll to find clues, combat-focused resolution
* Attempted aesthetic: Mystery investigation
* Result: ❌ Mechanics fight against aesthetic

**Validation:** Systems designed aesthetic-first succeed. Systems adapted mechanics-first struggle.

**Framework implication:** MDA reversal principle (start with aesthetics) is validated. Framework is correct on this point.

**Confidence:** High. Multiple examples confirm (Gumshoe, Weather Factory, PbtA all designed aesthetic-first and succeed).

***

#### Finding 3: Investment/Payoff Must Match Player Energy State (Scenario 3)

**Framework principle tested:** Part 6 (Investment/Payoff Spectrum)—"Match system demands to player energy state"

**Test case:** Mystery investigation with monthly sessions

**Analysis:**

* Mystery aesthetic requires: HIGH cognitive investment (note-taking, deduction, sustained attention)
* Monthly sessions mean: Long gaps, memory decay, limited session time
* Traditional mystery systems: Demand high investment without supporting continuity
* Result: ❌ Mismatch between demand and available player resources

**LLM solution:** Reduce cognitive burden through perfect state tracking, efficient recap

**Validation:** Investment/payoff mismatch creates frustration. Systems must account for player energy constraints.

**Framework implication:** Investment/Payoff spectrum correctly identifies real design problem. Framework is validated.

**Confidence:** High. This explains why busy adults struggle with traditional campaign play—investment demanded exceeds available resources.

#### Finding 4: System Functions Are Not Equal (Scenario 3)

**Framework principle tested:** Part 10 (System Functions)—Systems perform specific functions; aesthetics require different functions

**Test case:** Mystery investigation critical functions

**Analysis:**

* Information Management: ✓ Critical for mystery (core vs. optional clues)
* State Persistence: ✓ Critical for infrequent play (continuity across gaps)
* Character-Aesthetic Alignment: ✓ Critical for player investment (detective mindset)
* Content Generation: ⚠️ Valuable but not essential (prep problem)
* Other functions: ➖ Neutral (not particularly important for mystery)

**Validation:** Not all functions matter equally for all aesthetics. Some aesthetics depend on specific functions working well.

**Framework implication:** System selection should prioritize required functions. D\&D fails at mystery because critical function (information management) is broken.

**Test for system selection:** "For each function your aesthetic requires, verify system provides it. If 2+ critical functions are missing/broken, choose different system."

**Confidence:** High. This explains why purpose-built systems outperform adapted systems—they're designed with critical functions for specific aesthetic.

#### Finding 5: Character Creation Can Break System (Scenario 3)

**Framework principle tested:** New addition (Part 11)—"Character creation is first enforcement point of aesthetic requirements"

**Test case:** "Cowardly warrior" in mystery game

**Analysis:**

* System needed: Characters who care about solving mysteries correctly
* Player created: Character who cares about survival and payment
* Result: Red herrings (essential mystery element) had no meaning
  * For detective: False lead = wasted time = failure
  * For warrior: False lead = still got paid = irrelevant
* System can't fix this with mechanics

**Validation:** Generic character creation allows players to build characters incompatible with aesthetic. No amount of mechanical design fixes this.

**Framework implication:** Character creation must filter for aesthetic-appropriate characters. This is now explicitly added to framework (Part 11).

**Confidence:** High. This is clear design insight with practical implications. Mystery games should restrict character creation to investigators.

### How to Use This Section

**For designers:**

* Hypotheses: Interesting patterns that might help your design, but verify for your specific case
* Research questions: Deeper problems that don't have clear answers yet
* Validated findings: Safe to rely on these principles, they're confirmed

**For researchers:**

* Hypotheses: Test these against your scenarios and report results
* Research questions: These need extensive study beyond scenario analysis
* Validated findings: Examples of framework working correctly

**For framework development:**

* Add hypotheses to framework only after validation across 3+ scenarios
* Research questions may never have definitive answers (acknowledge limitations)
* Validated findings confirm framework is working as intended

**Think of this as:** The "working notes" or "reader's guide" showing framework development process, not just final product. Makes framework scientific and transparent about confidence levels.

A game system is not its mechanics. It's the **designed interplay of mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing configured to serve a specific intended experience through specific functions.**

**What we learned from studying actual systems:**

**From D\&D:** Identity matters. Systems survive if they know what they are. Mechanical "improvements" fail if they violate identity.

**From Civilization:** Complexity must be managed. Spatial complexity feels better than numerical. Feedback loops create compulsion. Multiple victory paths create replayability.

**From PbtA:** Simple core mechanics enable more variation. Configuration matters more than mechanics. Same engine can serve opposite genres through reconfiguration.

**From MDA:** Start with aesthetics (experience goal), work backward to mechanics. Not mechanics-first. We control mechanics, we predict dynamics, but players come back for aesthetics.

**From Ludology:** Simple rules can produce complex emergent behavior. Systems interact in unpredictable ways. Test extensively.

**From Player Types:** Different players want different things. No system serves all equally. Target specific types.

**From Five Components:** Systems are mechanics + parameters + context + pacing + configuration. Change any component, you change the experience.

**From Core Loops:** The smallest repeatable cycle must be satisfying. Tasks end, loops continue. Every element should enhance or protect the loop.

**From Engagement Curves:** Sessions have temporal shape. Hook → Onboarding → Early Mastery → Flow → Exit Hook. Get any phase wrong, lose the player.

**From Flow Theory:** Challenge must equal skill. Too hard = anxiety. Too easy = boredom. Just right = flow. Include recovery mechanics for frustrated players.

**From Investment/Payoff:** Match system demands to player energy state. Same player needs different experiences when exhausted vs energized. Payoff must justify investment.

**From System Functions:** Systems don't just resolve—they adjudicate, manage information, generate content, persist state, encode cognition, design constraints, enable solo play. Structure and function both matter.

**From Designer Responsibility:** Games create experiences that affect people. Purpose guides design. Knowledge and lived experience matter. Sometimes the right answer is "I shouldn't make this game." Ethics are not optional.

**The Design Process:**

1. **Define purpose** (what experience? why does it matter?)
2. **Check ethical boundaries** (should I make this? do I have the knowledge?)
3. **Know target audience** (player types, energy states)
4. **Choose five components** to serve experience:
   * Mechanics (what players do)
   * Parameters (how much, how fast, how scarce)
   * Context (what it means)
   * Pacing (when things happen)
   * Configuration (how it all combines)
5. **Design functions** to enable experience:
   * Adjudication (resolving uncertainty)
   * Information management (controlling discovery)
   * Content generation (creating situations)
   * State persistence (remembering across time)
   * Cognitive encoding (shaping thinking) \[if relevant]
   * Constraint design (creating meaningful limitations)
   * Solo play procedures (if needed)
6. **Identify core loop** (what repeats, why it's satisfying)
7. **Design engagement curve** (hook to exit)
8. **Tune for flow state** (challenge scales with skill)
9. **Match investment to payoff** (respect player energy)
10. **Include safety tools** (X-Card, lines/veils, consent)
11. **Test if experience emerges** (playtest with target audience)
12. **Iterate** (or abandon if it doesn't work)

**The Core Insight:**

Systems that fail start with mechanics and look for uses. Systems that succeed start with experience and build mechanics to serve it.

**Good systems know:**

* What they are (identity)
* Why they exist (purpose)
* Who they're for (player type and energy state)
* What they do (functions they perform)
* What boundaries they respect (ethics)
* Every component serves the same aesthetic
* Every function enables the intended experience

**Bad systems:**

* Start with mechanics instead of aesthetics
* Add complexity without purpose
* Treat context as cosmetic
* Demand wrong investment level
* Have incoherent configuration
* Exploit instead of engage
* Ignore functions beyond resolution
* Cause harm through ignorance or carelessness
* Use wrong system for intended aesthetic

**The art of game design is configuration:** Choosing the right components and functions, combining them so they work together to consistently create the intended experience for the target audience at the appropriate investment level, while respecting ethical boundaries.

**The responsibility of game design is purpose:** Understanding what experience you're creating, why it matters, who it's for, whether you should create it, and how to do so without causing harm.

Purpose before mechanics. Always.

Function serves purpose. Always.

Ethics guide everything. Always.

Everything else is details.

### From System Design to Market Strategy

This document focuses on HOW to design game systems: structure, function, purpose, ethics. But understanding systems is only half the picture.

The other half is choosing WHICH system to design—what experience to create, what audience to serve, what gap to fill.

**Market-aware design considers:**

* What aesthetics are dominant in your target space?
* What aesthetics are missing but desired?
* What pain points do existing systems create?
* What timing and visibility factors affect success?

This strategic analysis (aesthetic gap identification, market timing, coherence maintenance) complements system design skills. Once you understand how to build systems coherently, study markets to choose which systems to build wisely.

**The integration:** Use market analysis to identify target aesthetic → Use this framework to design system that delivers it → Test against scenarios to validate → Launch with awareness of timing and positioning.

Purpose-driven design + market awareness = systems that work AND succeed.

**Note on this framework:** This document represents current understanding based on historical analysis and ethical considerations. The separation between structural components (Part 2) and system functions (Part 10) suggests these dimensions may need deeper integration in future work. The need to explicitly address designer responsibility (Part 11) alongside technical design reflects that game systems are social/ethical artifacts, not just mechanical ones. We acknowledge these complexities while providing the best current synthesis for practical use.

**This framework will evolve.** As we test against real scenarios, gaps will emerge. As we build systems, we'll discover what we missed. As we cause harm (inevitably, despite best efforts), we'll learn to do better.

The goal is not perfection. The goal is continuous improvement guided by purpose and responsibility.
