# Part 2: Balance Paradigms

Balance isn't one thing. There are fundamentally different approaches to creating balanced play experiences, each serving different aesthetics and requiring different methods.

We call these **balance paradigms**—the underlying philosophy of how balance works in your game.

**The three working paradigms:**

1. **Framework-Based Balance:** Explicit decision frameworks create consistent adjudication (Adjudication function—see Writing Guidelines Part 1, System Functions)
2. **Consistency-Based Balance:** Static, repeatable challenges enable pattern learning
3. **Adaptive Balance:** Dynamic systems adjust to player performance

**Plus:** Hybrid approaches combining paradigms for different subsystems.

Understanding paradigms helps you:

* Choose the right approach for your aesthetic
* Communicate design intent clearly
* Know what to build and how to validate it
* Avoid mixing incompatible approaches

***

## Genre Determines Paradigm Fit

✅ **New framework integration** (from Context Chapter)

**Critical insight:** Different genres require different balance paradigms. Choosing the wrong paradigm for your genre creates incoherent experiences.

### Genre-Paradigm Mapping

**Mystery Investigation Genre (Discovery/Narrative aesthetics):**

* **Requires:** Framework paradigm
* **Why:** Investigation needs flexibility—players approach clues differently, ask unexpected questions, combine evidence creatively
* **Example:** Gumshoe uses judgment framework for investigation (core clues automatic, Investigation Points for depth)
* **Breaks with:** Consistency (fixed outcomes would make some investigation paths impossible)
* **Breaks with:** Adaptive (adjusting difficulty removes deduction challenge)

**Horror Survival Genre (Tension aesthetic):**

* **Requires:** Consistency OR Adaptive (depending on horror approach)
* **Consistency for:** Pattern-learning horror (Alien: Isolation, Resident Evil)
  * Why: Players learn enemy patterns to survive, mastery through understanding threat
* **Adaptive for:** Dynamic threat horror (Left 4 Dead AI Director)
  * Why: Threat adjusts to maintain pressure without overwhelming
* **Breaks with:** Framework (negotiated stakes remove terror—"let's discuss how scared I am" kills horror)

**Heist Genre (Narrative/Tension aesthetics):**

* **Requires:** Framework paradigm
* **Why:** Planning and flashbacks require flexible resolution ("I planned for this!" moments)
* **Example:** Blades in the Dark Position/Effect enables planning vs. improvisation trade-offs
* **Breaks with:** Pure Consistency (rigid outcomes kill improvisation and clever solutions)
* **Breaks with:** Adaptive (heist success should depend on planning, not difficulty scaling)

**Tactical Combat Genre (Challenge/Mastery aesthetics):**

* **Requires:** Consistency paradigm
* **Why:** Mastery requires learnable, repeatable patterns
* **Example:** XCOM, Into the Breach, Dark Souls (fixed enemy stats, consistent rules)
* **Can incorporate:** Adaptive elements (AI behavior variation) within consistent framework
* **Breaks with:** Framework (negotiated combat removes tactical optimization)

**Cozy Life Sim Genre (Submission/Discovery aesthetics):**

* **Requires:** Framework OR minimal Consistency (forgiving, no harsh failures)
* **Why:** Relaxation requires safety—no punishing optimization or pattern mastery
* **Example:** Stardew Valley (flexible systems, forgiving consequences, no permadeath)
* **Breaks with:** Strict Consistency with harsh consequences (creates anxiety, not relaxation)
* **Breaks with:** Adaptive difficulty ramping (pressure increases contradict cozy feeling)

**Roguelike Genre (Challenge/Mastery aesthetics):**

* **Requires:** Consistency with procedural variation
* **Why:** Mastery requires learnable patterns despite randomized content
* **Example:** Slay the Spire (card effects consistent, encounters varied)
* **Can incorporate:** Adaptive elements (difficulty modifiers) as player-chosen options
* **Breaks with:** Framework (negotiation removes challenge of fixed rules)

### How to Choose Paradigm from Genre

**Step 1: Identify your genre** (not just setting/dressing)

* What structural experience type? (Mystery? Horror? Heist? Tactical combat?)
* See Context Chapter Part 2 for genre selection process

**Step 2: Check genre's paradigm requirements**

* Does genre need flexibility (investigation, heists) → Framework
* Does genre need pattern mastery (horror, tactics) → Consistency
* Does genre need dynamic adjustment (co-op survival) → Adaptive
* Does genre need safety/forgiveness (cozy, relaxation) → Framework or forgiving Consistency

**Step 3: Validate paradigm serves aesthetic**

* Does paradigm create intended feeling?
* Does paradigm enable genre-specific gameplay?
* Does paradigm avoid contradicting genre expectations?

**Step 4: Test for coherence**

* Can players engage with genre through this paradigm?
* Does paradigm import mechanics from different genre?
* Example: Mystery + combat XP (imports challenge genre mechanics, breaks investigation)

### Warning: Genre-Paradigm Mismatches

**Common failures:**

❌ **Mystery investigation + Consistency paradigm:**

* Problem: Fixed outcomes make some investigation approaches impossible
* Example: D\&D investigation (roll to find clue → can fail → mystery stalls)
* Result: Players frustrated when valid approaches don't work

❌ **Horror survival + Framework paradigm:**

* Problem: Negotiating stakes removes terror
* Example: "Let's discuss how scared my character is" (breaks immersion)
* Result: Horror becomes negotiation exercise

❌ **Tactical combat + Framework paradigm:**

* Problem: Negotiated outcomes remove optimization challenge
* Example: "This seems hard, let's make it easier" (no mastery curve)
* Result: Challenge aesthetic lost

❌ **Heist planning + Strict Consistency:**

* Problem: Fixed outcomes prevent improvisation and flashbacks
* Example: "I would have planned for this" → "Too bad, you didn't explicitly say so"
* Result: Heist genre violated (no clever solutions)

## Framework-Based Balance

### What It Is

**Framework-based balance uses explicit decision frameworks that create consistent adjudication (Adjudication function) of unpredictable situations.**

Instead of pre-determining outcomes or calculating probabilities for every possible action, you define a **framework for evaluating actions in the moment**. The GM or system uses this framework to determine stakes, risks, and outcomes consistently.

**Core mechanism:** Players propose actions → Framework evaluates situation → Stakes negotiated/determined → Resolution occurs

**Key example:** Blades in the Dark's Position and Effect system

* **Position** (risk level): Controlled, Risky, or Desperate
* **Effect** (potential outcome): Limited, Standard, or Great
* GM uses framework to assign Position and Effect for any action
* Players can see stakes before committing
* Same framework applies to all situations

### When to Use Framework Paradigm

**Best for these aesthetics:**

* ★★★ **Narrative:** Players need agency over story direction, transparent stakes enable meaningful choices
* ★★★ **Discovery:** Framework handles novel situations players invent
* ★★ **Fellowship:** Shared understanding of framework enables group decision-making
* ★ **Expression:** Framework accommodates creative player approaches

**Design context requirements:**

* Human GM or sophisticated AI (someone/something can apply framework)
* Players comfortable with negotiation/discussion
* Moderate session length (time for framework application)
* Not time-pressured (real-time combat rarely uses framework)

**When NOT to use:**

* Pure Challenge aesthetic (pattern mastery requires consistency, not negotiation)
* Time-critical gameplay (no time for stake negotiation)
* Solo digital games without AI capable of framework application
* Players who prefer deterministic outcomes

### How Framework Balance Works

**The framework provides:**

**1. Risk Assessment Criteria**
How dangerous is this action given the situation?

Example (Blades in the Dark Position):

* **Controlled:** You're in a good position, danger limited
* **Risky:** Standard danger level, things could go wrong
* **Desperate:** You're in serious danger, major consequences likely

**What determines Position:** Enemy awareness, your preparation, your resources, the fiction

**2. Outcome Potential Criteria**
How much can you accomplish with this action?

Example (Blades in the Dark Effect):

* **Limited:** Partial progress toward goal
* **Standard:** Achieve your immediate goal
* **Great:** Achieve goal plus extra benefit

**What determines Effect:** Your approach, relevant abilities, situation factors, scale mismatch

**3. Consequence Structure**
What happens when things go wrong?

Example (Blades in the Dark):

* Reduced effect (accomplish less)
* Complication (new problem arises)
* Lost opportunity (can't try this approach again)
* Harm (damage to character)
* Worse position (next action more dangerous)

**4. Resolution Mechanism**
How do you determine outcome within framework?

Example (Blades in the Dark):

* Roll dice pool, count successes
* 6: Success at stated Effect
* 4-5: Success at reduced Effect OR success with consequence
* 1-3: Failure, suffer consequence at stated Position

### Setting Parameters in Framework Systems

**You're not setting exact values—you're defining framework tiers and ranges.**

**Step 1: Define your framework dimensions**

* Risk levels (typically 3-5 tiers)
* Outcome levels (typically 3-5 tiers)
* Consequence types (typically 4-8 types)

**Step 2: Set ranges for each tier**

Example: Harm consequences in Blades

* **Controlled Position:** 0-1 harm
* **Risky Position:** 1-2 harm
* **Desperate Position:** 2-4 harm

Example: Progress toward goal

* **Limited Effect:** 1-2 segments on 6-segment clock
* **Standard Effect:** 2-3 segments
* **Great Effect:** 3-5 segments

**Step 3: Create framework application guidance**

Not exact formulas, but principles:

* "Position determined by: How prepared are you? How alert is opposition? How exposed are you?"
* "Effect determined by: How suited is your approach? Do you have relevant abilities? Is there scale mismatch?"

**Step 4: Test framework consistency**

Can GM/players apply framework to same situation consistently?

* Multiple GMs presented same scenario should give similar Position/Effect
* Same GM should give consistent rulings for similar situations
* Players should understand framework well enough to predict stakes

### Number-Setting Example: Investigation Framework

**Goal:** Players investigating mystery, need framework for information gathering

**Framework dimensions:**

* **Risk:** How dangerous is this investigation approach?
  * Low: Safe, no alert raised, no time pressure
  * Medium: Some danger, might alert opposition or consume time
  * High: Dangerous, likely to alert opposition or create complications

* **Information Gain:** How much can you learn?
  * Minor: Hint or small clue (1-2 preparation points)
  * Major: Significant clue or tactical advantage (3-4 preparation points)
  * Critical: Key revelation or major advantage (5+ preparation points)

**Resolution:** 2d6 + relevant modifier

* 10+: Gain information at stated level, no downside
* 7-9: Gain information at stated level BUT pay cost (time, exposure, complication)
* 6-: Don't gain information, suffer consequence based on Risk level

**Parameters derived:**

* Not "this specific action succeeds/fails"
* But "this class of actions has these stakes"
* GM applies framework in moment based on fiction

### Advantages of Framework Paradigm

**Handles unpredictability:** Players will try things you didn't anticipate. Framework evaluates new situations consistently without pre-authoring every possibility.

**Player agency:** Transparent stakes ("This is Risky position, Standard effect") let players make informed choices. They can adjust approach to change stakes.

**Narrative flexibility:** Same mechanics generate different fictional outcomes. "I convince the guard" might be Risky or Controlled depending on your preparation, creating different stories.

**Scales with player creativity:** More creative approaches might improve Position or Effect within framework. Rewards lateral thinking.

### Challenges of Framework Paradigm

**Requires judgment:** GM/system must evaluate situations on the fly. Less formulaic than Consistency paradigm.

**Learning curve:** Players need to internalize framework to predict stakes. Initial sessions slower as players learn.

**Potential inconsistency:** Different GMs might apply framework differently. Requires calibration and examples.

**Not suitable for pure Challenge:** Framework negotiation conflicts with Challenge aesthetic's desire for consistent patterns to master.

### Framework Paradigm Checklist

Use Framework paradigm if:

* ✓ Your aesthetic prioritizes narrative agency or discovery
* ✓ You have human GM or sophisticated AI
* ✓ Players can negotiate stakes before committing
* ✓ Situations too varied to pre-author all outcomes
* ✓ You can provide framework training/examples

Don't use Framework paradigm if:

* ✗ Pure Challenge aesthetic (needs consistency)
* ✗ Real-time pressure (no time for negotiation)
* ✗ Automated system without AI (can't evaluate situations)
* ✗ Players prefer deterministic outcomes

***

## Consistency-Based Balance

### What It Is

**Consistency-based balance uses static, repeatable challenges that enable pattern learning and skill mastery.**

The same inputs always produce the same outputs. Enemies have fixed stats, behave predictably, and occupy consistent positions. Players learn patterns through experience and get better at executing optimal responses.

**Core mechanism:** Challenge presented → Player responds → Outcome determined by execution → Same challenge next time behaves identically

**Key example:** Dark Souls

* Goblin always has 8 HP, always does 2 damage, always attacks with same pattern
* Boss always occupies same arena, uses same moveset, has same HP/damage
* Player learns through repetition: dodge timing, attack windows, positioning
* Victory comes from player skill improvement, not character power increase

### When to Use Consistency Paradigm

**Best for these aesthetics:**

* ★★★ **Challenge:** Pattern mastery is the core appeal, requires consistency
* ★★★ **Mastery:** Deep system understanding requires stable patterns to study
* ★★ **Tension:** High stakes feel fair when patterns are knowable
* ★ **Narrative:** Can serve authored story beats with fixed dramatic moments

**Design context requirements:**

* Can pre-author content (know what challenges exist)
* Players willing to retry and learn patterns
* Moderate to long play time (enough time to encounter patterns multiple times)
* Digital or tabletop with good prep

**When NOT to use:**

* Discovery aesthetic (predictability kills surprise)
* Submission aesthetic (pattern learning is work, not relaxation)
* Single-session one-shot (no time to learn patterns through repetition)
* When you want dynamic pacing (consistency means fixed difficulty)

### How Consistency Balance Works

**The system provides:**

**1. Fixed Challenge Parameters**
Every challenge has exact, unchanging stats.

Example (tactical combat):

* Goblin: 8 HP, AC 14, +4 to hit, 1d6+2 damage (5 avg)
* Orc: 15 HP, AC 13, +5 to hit, 1d8+3 damage (7.5 avg)
* Dragon: 200 HP, AC 18, +10 to hit, 2d10+6 damage (17 avg)

These never change. Same goblin in area 1 = same stats as goblin in area 2.

**2. Predictable Behavior Patterns**
Enemies/challenges behave according to consistent rules.

Example (Dark Souls boss):

* Attack pattern: Slash → Slash → Pause → Overhead smash → Pause
* Pattern always same at this HP range
* Telegraphs always same (wind-up animation)
* Dodge windows always same timing
* Vulnerabilities always same (exposed during overhead recovery)

**3. Deterministic Outcomes**
Same player action in same situation = same result (or known probability).

Example:

* Attack with +6 modifier against AC 14 = 65% hit chance every time
* Rolling a 15 = hit, rolling a 7 = miss, same every encounter
* Boss charge attack hits for 20 damage whether it's try #1 or try #100

**4. Learnable Mastery Curve**
Players improve by:

* Recognizing patterns faster
* Executing optimal responses more reliably
* Understanding underlying systems better
* Minimizing mistakes through practice

### Setting Parameters in Consistency Systems

**You're setting exact, fixed values that enable pattern learning.**

**Step 1: Define power baseline**
What's your reference point?

Example (D\&D-style):

* "Level 3 player": \~20 HP, +5 to hit, \~9 damage per hit
* Design all challenges relative to this baseline

**Step 2: Calculate expected engagements**

How long should this challenge take?

Example (boss fight):

* Target: 20-25 player turns (4 players × 5-6 rounds each)
* Player damage per round (4 players × 9 damage × 65% hit) = \~23 DPR
* Boss HP = 23 DPR × 23 rounds = 529 HP → **round to 540 HP**

**Step 3: Set threat level**

How dangerous should this challenge be?

Example (same boss):

* Want: Boss can incapacitate player in 3-4 hits (high threat but not instant death)
* Player HP: 20
* Boss damage per attack: 20 ÷ 3.5 = \~6 damage
* Set: Boss deals 2d6+1 damage (8 average, 3-13 range)

**Step 4: Design patterns**

What behaviors can players learn?

Example (same boss):

* Pattern 1: Slash → Slash → Overhead (predictable rhythm)
* Pattern 2: Roar telegraph → Charge attack (avoidable if you dodge on roar)
* Pattern 3: At 50% HP, gains additional attack (learnable threshold)
* Pattern 4: Regenerates if in moonlight (environmental interaction)

**Step 5: Test repeatability**

Does the pattern work every time?

* Same boss, same player approach = same outcome?
* Can players learn and execute optimal strategy?
* Does mastery curve exist (first attempt hard, tenth attempt manageable)?

### Number-Setting Example: Tactical Combat Encounter

**Goal:** Challenge encounter for 4 "level 3" players

**Player baseline:**

* 20 HP each (80 HP total)
* +5 to hit
* 9 damage per hit
* \~65% hit rate against AC 14

**Enemy design:**

* **Count:** 6 enemies (action economy balance—more enemies than players)
* **HP per enemy:** 15 HP (die in 2 player hits on average)
* **AC:** 13 (70% player hit rate—slightly easier than baseline)
* **To-hit:** +4 (need 11+ to hit player, 50% hit rate)
* **Damage:** 1d6+1 (5 average)

**Expected outcome:**

* Players kill 2 enemies per round (8 attacks × 70% × 9 damage ÷ 15 HP ≈ 3.36 enemies)
* Combat lasts 2-3 rounds (6 enemies ÷ 2.5 per round)
* Players take 15 damage per round (6 enemies × 50% × 5 damage)
* Total player damage taken: 30-45 (out of 80 HP total—survivable but threatening)

**Pattern to learn:**

* Focus fire (kill enemies quickly to reduce incoming damage)
* Positioning (use terrain to limit enemy actions)
* Action economy (control/disable enemies more efficient than trading damage)

**Validation:**

* Run encounter multiple times
* Does it consistently take 2-4 rounds?
* Do players consistently survive if playing well?
* Do players lose if playing poorly (not focusing fire)?

### Advantages of Consistency Paradigm

**Skill expression:** Player improvement directly visible. "I beat this boss that killed me 20 times" feels earned.

**Fair challenge:** Same inputs = same outputs means no "the game cheated" feeling. Failures feel like player error.

**Deep mastery:** Consistent patterns reward study. Speedrunners can optimize to seconds because patterns are knowable.

**Predictable pacing:** Designer knows how long encounters take, can structure experience deliberately.

### Challenges of Consistency Paradigm

**Limited variety:** Same encounter feels same each time. Replay value depends on player enjoying pattern mastery, not novelty.

**Requires content creation:** Can't dynamically generate challenges. Must author each encounter deliberately.

**Can't adapt to player skill:** Struggling player faces same difficulty as skilled player. No help if someone's stuck.

**Discovery conflicts:** Predictable patterns conflict with surprise. Once learned, mystery gone.

### Consistency Paradigm Checklist

Use Consistency paradigm if:

* ✓ Challenge or Mastery aesthetic primary
* ✓ Players willing to retry and learn patterns
* ✓ You can pre-author content
* ✓ Time budget allows pattern learning (not one-shot)
* ✓ Player skill progression is core appeal

Don't use Consistency paradigm if:

* ✗ Discovery aesthetic (patterns kill surprise)
* ✗ Single-session with no retry opportunity
* ✗ Need to accommodate wide skill ranges dynamically
* ✗ Want each playthrough to feel different

***

## Adaptive Balance

### What It Is

**Adaptive balance uses dynamic systems that adjust to player performance, maintaining target experience through responsive difficulty.**

Instead of fixed challenges or negotiated stakes, the system monitors player state and adjusts parameters in real-time to create desired pacing, support struggling players, or challenge successful players.

**Core mechanism:** System monitors player performance → Compares to target experience → Adjusts parameters (spawns, items, difficulty) → Maintains desired state

**Key example:** Left 4 Dead 2's AI Director

* Monitors player health, ammo, progress rate, deaths
* Adjusts zombie spawn rate, special infected frequency, item placement
* Creates dramatic pacing: build-up → peak intensity → relief → repeat
* Same map plays differently each time based on team performance

### When to Use Adaptive Paradigm

**Best for these aesthetics:**

* ★★★ **Fellowship:** Balance skill gaps, keep all players engaged
* ★★★ **Discovery:** Create variety, maintain novelty across playthroughs
* ★★ **Tension:** Maintain dramatic pacing through adaptive intensity
* ★ **Progression:** Adjust challenge to growing player power
* ★ **Challenge:** ONLY if bounded carefully (unbounded adaptation kills mastery)

**Design context requirements:**

* Computer-managed system (real-time monitoring/adjustment)
* OR experienced GM willing to track state and adapt
* Enough playtime for adaptation to matter (not 5-minute game)
* Player acceptance of non-deterministic difficulty

**When NOT to use:**

* Pure Challenge aesthetic (adaptation prevents pattern mastery)
* Competitive games (fairness requires consistent challenge)
* Players who want "I beat the intended challenge" achievement
* Limited technical capability (complex state tracking)

### How Adaptive Balance Works

**The system provides:**

**1. State Monitoring**
What does system track about players?

Example (L4D2 AI Director):

* Individual player: HP, ammo, location, recent damage taken
* Team aggregate: Average HP, items available, progress rate
* Recent history: Deaths in last 5 minutes, time since last horde
* Intensity level: Current stress on team (0-100 scale)

**2. Adaptation Rules**
How does state influence parameters?

Example (L4D2):

```
IF team_avg_health < 40%
  THEN increase_health_item_spawns (60% → 80% chance)
  AND reduce_special_infected_spawns (30 sec → 45 sec intervals)

IF no_deaths_last_5_minutes AND progress_fast
  THEN spawn_Tank (create challenge spike)
  AND increase_horde_frequency

IF player_isolated_from_team
  THEN spawn_special_infected_targeting_them (punish lone wolves)
```

**3. Bounds and Constraints**
Adaptation isn't unlimited—define ranges.

Example (L4D2):

* Spawn rate range: 1-10 zombies per 30 seconds (not 0, not 100)
* Item spawn range: 20-80% (not guaranteed, not impossible)
* Intensity cycles: Must include relief phases (can't sustain peak)

**4. Pacing Structure**
How does adaptation create experience flow?

Example (L4D2 Director phases):

* **Build-Up:** Gradually increase spawn rate, build tension
* **Peak:** Maximum intensity, overwhelming numbers
* **Relax:** Reduce/stop spawns, allow recovery (30-45 seconds)
* **Repeat cycle** with varying intensity and duration

### Setting Parameters in Adaptive Systems

**You're defining bounds, not fixed values, plus adaptation rules.**

**Step 1: Define baseline challenge**
What's the "default" difficulty?

Example (cooperative horde game):

* Baseline spawn rate: 5 zombies per 30 seconds
* Baseline item spawn: 40% chance at item points
* Baseline special infected: Every 30 seconds

**Step 2: Set adaptation ranges**
How much can difficulty vary?

Example:

* Spawn rate range: 1-10 zombies per 30 seconds (10x variation)
* Item spawn range: 20-80% (4x variation)
* Special infected timing: 20-60 seconds (3x variation)

**Step 3: Define trigger conditions**
When does adaptation occur?

Example:

```
Easy triggers (help struggling team):
- Any player below 25% HP → increase item spawns
- Team wipe in last 2 minutes → reduce enemy density
- Multiple players incapacitated → delay next horde

Hard triggers (challenge successful team):
- No damage taken 3 minutes → spawn Tank
- Team moving very fast → increase spawns ahead
- All players above 80% HP → reduce item spawns
```

**Step 4: Set pacing parameters**
How do intensity cycles work?

Example:

* Build-up phase: 60-90 seconds (ramp up to peak)
* Peak phase: 15-30 seconds (maximum intensity)
* Relax phase: 30-45 seconds (minimal spawns)
* Total cycle: \~2-3 minutes

**Step 5: Test adaptation subtlety**
Can players notice adaptation? Should they?

Example questions:

* Does difficulty adjustment feel manipulative? ("The game is helping me, so my victory doesn't count")
* Can players exploit adaptation? (Intentionally trigger "help" states)
* Does adaptation maintain engagement? (Neither too easy nor too hard)

### Number-Setting Example: Roguelike Encounter Scaling

**Goal:** Adapt encounter difficulty to player's current run strength

**State tracking:**

* Player power: HP, damage output, special abilities acquired
* Run progress: Which floor (1-10), time taken so far
* Recent performance: Damage taken last 3 encounters, deaths

**Baseline encounter (Floor 5):**

* 4 enemies, 20 HP each, 6 damage per hit
* Expected: Player takes 15-20 damage, kills enemies in 8-10 attacks

**Adaptation rules:**

```
Player power above expected for floor:
- Increase enemy count (4 → 5 enemies)
- OR increase enemy HP (+20%, 20 → 24 HP)
- OR increase enemy damage (+25%, 6 → 7.5 damage)

Player power below expected:
- Decrease enemy count (4 → 3 enemies)
- OR spawn healing item after encounter
- OR provide favorable terrain (choke point)

Recent deaths (player struggling):
- Reduce enemy density next 2 encounters
- Guarantee healing item spawn
- Easier enemy types (no special abilities)

Steamrolling (player too strong):
- Elite enemies (2x HP, special abilities)
- Ambush encounters (start surrounded)
- Environmental hazards
```

**Bounds:**

* Enemy count range: 2-6 (never 1, never 10+)
* HP multiplier range: 0.7x-1.5x (within ±50%)
* Must provide winning chance (not impossible scaling)

**Validation:**

* Do runs feel appropriately challenging regardless of power level?
* Can skilled players still feel powerful (don't over-adapt)?
* Do struggling players get enough help without it feeling patronizing?

### Advantages of Adaptive Paradigm

**Accommodates skill variance:** Different skill levels get appropriate challenge. Struggling player gets help, expert gets challenge.

**Maintains engagement:** Prevents both "too easy" boredom and "too hard" frustration through active adjustment.

**Replay variety:** Same content feels different based on performance, creating variety without new content.

**Dramatic pacing:** Can create movie-like intensity curves (build tension → climax → relief) dynamically.

### Challenges of Adaptive Paradigm

**Can feel manipulative:** Players who notice adaptation may feel "the game is patronizing me" or "my success doesn't count."

**Prevents pure mastery:** Challenge seekers want to overcome fixed obstacle, not shifting target. Adaptation conflicts with mastery satisfaction.

**Technical complexity:** Real-time state tracking and parameter adjustment requires development resources.

**Hard to tune:** Finding right adaptation bounds and triggers requires extensive playtesting.

**Exploitable:** Savvy players can game adaptation (intentionally trigger "help" states).

### Adaptive Paradigm Checklist

Use Adaptive paradigm if:

* ✓ Fellowship or Discovery aesthetic primary
* ✓ Wide skill range in player population
* ✓ Technical capability for state tracking
* ✓ Dramatic pacing more important than consistent challenge
* ✓ Replay variety valued

Don't use Adaptive paradigm if:

* ✗ Pure Challenge aesthetic (mastery requires consistency)
* ✗ Competitive fairness critical
* ✗ Limited development resources
* ✗ Players expect "I beat the designer's intended challenge"
* ✗ Short play sessions (not enough time to adapt)

***

## Hybrid Approaches

Most games don't use one paradigm exclusively. You can combine paradigms for different subsystems.

### Common Hybrid Patterns

**1. Consistency + Framework**

* **Core mechanics:** Consistent (HP, damage, movement rules)
* **Situational resolution:** Framework (stakes negotiation)
* **Example:** Blades in the Dark has consistent Position/Effect framework, but specific outcomes negotiated
* **Why it works:** Framework handles unpredictable player creativity, consistency provides mechanical foundation

**2. Consistency + Bounded Adaptive**

* **Core challenge:** Consistent (boss patterns, enemy stats)
* **Support systems:** Adaptive (co-op help, optional advantages)
* **Example:** Dark Souls allows summoning help (adaptive difficulty), but boss patterns stay consistent
* **Why it works:** Preserves mastery loop while accommodating different skill levels

**3. Framework + Adaptive**

* **Conflict resolution:** Framework (consistent negotiation)
* **Pacing/spawning:** Adaptive (intensity management)
* **Example:** Could combine Blades-style framework with L4D2-style dynamic encounter generation
* **Why it works:** Framework handles player choices, adaptation creates variety

**4. Different Paradigms for Different Phases**

* **Exploration:** Framework (handle unpredictable player actions)
* **Combat:** Consistency (pattern learning)
* **Example:** Our Village Mystery + Boss Fight scenario from Part 1
* **Why it works:** Each phase uses paradigm suited to its aesthetic goals

### When to Use Hybrid

**Good reasons:**

* Different subsystems serve different aesthetics (exploration = discovery, combat = challenge)
* Want advantages of multiple paradigms without downsides
* Core system needs consistency but edges benefit from flexibility
* Accommodate wide player skill range while preserving mastery

**Bad reasons:**

* "More paradigms = more better" (complexity without purpose)
* Trying to please everyone (dilutes core experience)
* Can't decide which paradigm, so use all (incoherent design)

### Hybrid Design Principles

**1. Clarity of boundaries**
Players should know which paradigm applies when.

Example:

* "Investigation phase uses framework (negotiate stakes)"
* "Boss fight uses consistency (fixed patterns to learn)"
* Clear transition between phases

**2. Paradigms don't conflict**
Combining paradigms that fight each other creates confusion.

Bad combination:

* Adaptive difficulty during pattern-learning boss fight
* Boss patterns change based on player performance
* Result: Can't learn patterns, adaptation destroys Challenge aesthetic

Good combination:

* Consistent boss patterns (learnable)
* Adaptive loot drops after boss (help if struggling)
* Result: Mastery preserved, but support available

**3. Complexity budget respected**
Each paradigm adds cognitive load. Don't overload players.

Example:

* Framework (learn negotiation rules) + Consistency (learn patterns) = manageable
* Framework + Consistency + Adaptive (also tracking adaptation states) = potentially overwhelming
* Consider whether benefits justify complexity

***

## Choosing Your Paradigm

### Decision Framework

**Step 1: Assess Design Context**
What's technically feasible for you?

* Computer-managed → Framework, Consistency, or Adaptive possible
* Human GM → Framework or Consistency feasible, Adaptive harder
* Pure tabletop without GM → Consistency most feasible

**Step 2: Identify Primary Aesthetic**
What experience are you creating?

* Challenge/Mastery → Consistency paradigm
* Narrative/Discovery → Framework paradigm
* Fellowship (wide skill range) → Adaptive paradigm
* Multiple aesthetics → Consider hybrid

**Step 3: Check Aesthetic-Paradigm Fit**

Use this quick reference:

| Aesthetic  | Framework | Consistency | Adaptive            |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Challenge  | ○         | ★★★         | △ (only if bounded) |

Legend:

* ★★★ = Ideal fit
* ★★ = Good fit
* ★ = Compatible
* ○ = Workable but not ideal
* △ = Risky, requires care
* ✗ = Conflicts

**Step 4: Consider Practical Factors**

* Time budget: Do players have time to learn patterns (Consistency) or negotiate stakes (Framework)?
* Development resources: Can you implement state tracking (Adaptive)?
* Player expectations: What paradigm will players expect given your genre/platform?

**Step 5: Choose and Commit**
Pick paradigm(s) that:

* Are feasible given your context
* Serve your primary aesthetic(s)
* Match your resources and expertise

Then build everything else around that choice.

### Example: Village Mystery + Boss Fight

**Context:** Tabletop, one GM, 4 players, single 5-hour session

**Aesthetics:**

* Investigation: Narrative (player-driven story) + Discovery (uncover secrets)
* Boss fight: Challenge (tactical victory through preparation)

**Paradigm choices:**

* **Investigation:** Framework (handle unpredictable player approaches, transparent stakes)
* **Boss fight:** Consistency (enable tactical planning, pattern learning through investigation)
* **Integration:** Investigation reveals boss patterns that would normally require repetition to learn

**Why this works:**

* Framework handles open-ended investigation (can't pre-author all possibilities)
* Consistency enables Challenge aesthetic in boss fight (patterns to master)
* Hybrid doesn't conflict (clear phase boundary, investigation informs consistency)

**What we build:**

* Investigation: Risk/Information framework, 2d6 resolution
* Boss fight: Fixed stats, consistent patterns, d20+AC resolution
* Integration: Tactical Unlocks + Preparation Pool bridge the two

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the three paradigms:

**Part 3:** Recipes for common aesthetic+paradigm combinations (concrete examples)
**Part 4:** What we learned analyzing real games using different paradigms
**Part 5:** Complete measurables catalog (what each paradigm requires you to optimize)
**Part 6:** How to derive actual numbers within your chosen paradigm

Your paradigm choice shapes everything that follows. Take time to choose deliberately.
