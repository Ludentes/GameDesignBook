# Part 9: Common Pitfalls

Even with systematic framework, designers make predictable mistakes. Here are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

***

## Pitfall 1: Skipping the Framework

**Symptom:** "I'll just set some numbers that feel right."

**Why it fails:**

* "Feel right" based on intuition, not design goals
* Can't explain why you chose those numbers
* Can't iterate systematically when they're wrong
* Different designers on team use different intuitions (inconsistent)

**Why designers do this:**

* Framework feels like extra work
* Want to start creating immediately
* Intuition feels reliable ("I've played lots of games")

**Actual cost:**

* 2-3x more iteration cycles (numbers wrong by larger margins)
* Team confusion (no shared vocabulary)
* More playtesting time needed (shooting in dark)

**How to avoid:**

* Framework saves time in iteration (spend 2 hours on framework, save 20 hours in playtesting)
* Use quick-start from recipes (Part 3)
* Even simple framework better than none

**Recovery if caught:**

* Playtest reveals numbers way off (50%+ errors)
* Stop, return to Part 1
* Document current design as "first draft"
* Apply framework to understand what you actually built
* Make informed second draft

***

## Pitfall 2: Aesthetic-Paradigm Mismatch

**Symptom:** "Players keep trying creative solutions but I designed fixed patterns."

**Why it fails:**

* Players want Framework (open-ended problem solving)
* You built Consistency (pattern execution)
* Neither side satisfied

**Common mismatches:**

**Mismatch A: Challenge aesthetic + Adaptive paradigm (unbounded)**

* Players want to master patterns
* System keeps changing difficulty
* Can't learn because moving target
* Result: Frustration, feels unfair

**Mismatch B: Discovery aesthetic + Consistency paradigm**

* Players want novelty and surprise
* System is predictable and repeating
* Boring after first playthrough
* Result: No replay value

**Mismatch C: Narrative aesthetic + No mechanical consequences**

* Players want meaningful story choices
* System has no stakes (can retry infinitely, no resource tracking)
* Choices feel cosmetic
* Result: Hollow narrative

**How to avoid:**

* Use compatibility matrix (Part 2)
* Check aesthetic-paradigm fit before setting numbers
* Communicate paradigm to players ("This is pattern-learning boss")

**Recovery if caught:**

* Severe: Need to rebuild with different paradigm (major work)
* Moderate: Add elements of needed paradigm (hybrid approach)
* Example: Consistency boss + optional Framework tactics (some creativity within patterns)

***

## Pitfall 3: Optimizing Wrong Measurables

**Symptom:** "Numbers are perfect but experience is wrong."

**Why it fails:**

* Time-to-Kill exactly 23 rounds ✓
* But player says "felt boring and tedious" ✗
* You optimized duration but ignored tension, consequence severity, pattern interest

**Example:**

```
Boss fight metrics:
- Duration: 23 rounds ✓ (target: 20-25)
- Hit rate: 62% ✓ (target: 60%)
- DPR: 24.1 ✓ (target: 23.4)

But:
- Boss has no patterns (same attack every turn)
- No risk of death (boss damage too low)
- No interesting decisions (mash attack button)

Technically balanced, completely boring.
```

**How to avoid:**

* Use aesthetic-specific measurables (Part 5)
* Challenge aesthetic needs: Consequence Severity, Pattern Consistency, Mastery Curve
* Don't just optimize Time-to-Kill
* Check experience measurables (Part 5, Component 7)

**Recovery if caught:**

* Playtest feedback: "It works but it's not fun"
* Return to measurables catalog (Part 5)
* Identify missing measurables (probably Consequence Severity, Pattern Interest)
* Add complexity/stakes, not just tune numbers

***

## Pitfall 4: Analysis Paralysis

**Symptom:** "I need to calculate everything perfectly before testing."

**Why it fails:**

* Spend months calculating, never playtest
* Perfect math doesn't account for human behavior
* Game never ships ("needs more tuning")

**Why designers do this:**

* Fear of putting imperfect work in front of players
* Want to "solve" balance mathematically
* Perfectionism

**Reality:**

* 80% accurate with 2 hours of work + playtesting beats 99% accurate with 200 hours of calculation
* Players do unexpected things (math can't predict)
* "Done and iterating" beats "perfect on paper"

**How to avoid:**

* Set time box (2-4 hours for initial numbers)
* Use framework to get in ballpark
* Playtest early and often
* Accept that first numbers will be wrong

**Recovery if caught:**

* Been working 3+ weeks without playtesting?
* Stop calculating, start testing
* First playtest will reveal what actually matters
* Iterate from data, not theory

***

## Pitfall 5: No Baseline Reference

**Symptom:** "Boss has 500 HP" without knowing what that means.

**Why it fails:**

* 500 HP might be killed in 2 rounds or 200 rounds
* Can't tell if 500 is right without damage context
* All numbers relative, not absolute

**Example error:**

```
Designer sets:
- Boss HP: 800
- Boss damage: 15 per hit

But forgot:
- Player HP: 100
- Player damage: 5 per hit

Result:
- Boss kills player in 7 hits (Boss DPR = 15, Player HP = 100)
- Player kills boss in 160 hits (Player DPR = 5, Boss HP = 800)
- Fight lasts 2.5 hours (way too long)

Could have been avoided by calculating:
- Target duration: 20-25 rounds
- Player DPR = 5 → Boss HP should be 5 × 23 = 115, not 800
```

**How to avoid:**

* Define player baseline first (Part 6, Section 2)
* Calculate everything relative to baseline
* Use formulas (Boss HP = Player DPR × Target Rounds)
* Work backwards from targets, not forwards from guesses

**Recovery if caught:**

* First playtest lasts 5 hours (or 5 minutes)
* Calculator or spreadsheet for formulas
* Recalculate using baseline approach

***

## Pitfall 6: Ignoring Variance

**Symptom:** "On average it works" but wildly inconsistent.

**Why it fails:**

* Average damage 10 doesn't tell you:
  * 1d20 (range 1-20, high variance)
  * 2d10 (range 2-20, low variance)
  * 10 flat (range 10-10, no variance)
* All have average 10.5 (or 10), very different feel

**Example:**

```
Boss designed for 20 rounds average
- 50% of fights: 15-25 rounds ✓
- 25% of fights: 5-10 rounds (way too short)
- 25% of fights: 30-45 rounds (way too long)

Average is 20, but experience inconsistent.
```

**How to avoid:**

* Consider variance when choosing resolution mechanic
* Test edge cases (what if low rolls? high rolls?)
* Use tighter probability distributions if consistency matters (2d6 not d20)
* Bound extreme outcomes (maximum damage caps)

**Recovery if caught:**

* Playtest reveals huge variance
* Check resolution mechanic (d20 has high variance)
* Switch to 2d6 or dice pool (lower variance)
* OR add bounds (cap damage at max, minimum at floor)

***

## Pitfall 7: Framework Too Complex

**Symptom:** GM takes 10 minutes to determine stakes for one action.

**Why it fails:**

* 5+ risk tiers (Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, High)
* 10+ consequence types (reduced effect, complication, lost opportunity, harm, stress, worse position, time pressure, alert, exposure, collateral damage)
* GM can't apply consistently
* Players can't predict outcomes

**Example:**

```
Player: "I sneak past the guard"
GM: [Looks at 5-tier risk table, 10 consequence types, cross-references character preparation, considers fictional positioning, checks modifiers...]
10 minutes later: "This is Medium-High risk with Standard-Plus effect"
Player: "What?"
```

**How to avoid:**

* 3 tiers maximum per dimension (Part 6, Section 2)
* 4-6 consequence types maximum
* GM should decide in \<30 seconds
* If taking longer, framework too complex

**Recovery if caught:**

* Playtest drags (spending more time negotiating than playing)
* Simplify ruthlessly (collapse tiers, remove consequences)
* 3 Risk × 3 Effect is plenty
* Test if GM can apply quickly

***

## Pitfall 8: Adaption Too Obvious

**Symptom:** Players notice difficulty changing, feel patronized.

**Why it fails:**

* Player struggles → System spawns health items immediately
* Player succeeds → System doubles enemy count next room
* Too blatant, breaks immersion
* Players feel manipulated

**Example:**

```
Player: "Why did three health packs just appear when I'm low HP?"
Player: "Weird, after we won easily, suddenly 10 enemies spawn."
Player: "The game is helping me / cheating against me."
```

**How to avoid:**

* Gradual adjustment (10-20% changes, not doubling)
* Delayed response (don't adapt immediately after trigger)
* Attribute to variation ("tough wave" not "system adapting")
* Test: Ask players if they noticed (if yes, too obvious)

**Recovery if caught:**

* Playtest feedback: "Is the game changing difficulty?"
* Make adjustments smaller (50% → 10%)
* Add delay between trigger and adaptation
* Hide behind pseudo-random variation

***

## Pitfall 9: No Integration Between Systems

**Symptom:** Investigation phase feels disconnected from boss fight.

**Why it fails:**

* Players spend 3 hours investigating
* Investigation has no mechanical impact on boss fight
* Investigation feels like wasted time
* Players skip investigation in future

**Example:**

```
Investigation: Players uncover boss weakness to fire
Boss fight: No mechanical representation of this knowledge
Result: Information was narrative only, no gameplay impact
Players frustrated: "Why did we investigate if it doesn't help?"
```

**How to avoid:**

* Design integration mechanism (Part 6, Section 3)
* Resource pool: Investigation generates points usable in boss fight
* Unlocks: Investigation reveals tactical options
* State changes: Investigation modifies boss parameters
* Test: Can players articulate what investigation gained them?

**Recovery if caught:**

* Playtest feedback: "Investigation didn't matter"
* Add explicit integration
* Preparation pool or tactical unlocks
* Make investigation advantages concrete

***

## Pitfall 10: Scope Creep Without Rebalancing

**Symptom:** Started with 10 items, now have 100, original balance broken.

**Why it fails:**

* Each item balanced against original 10
* New items didn't account for interactions with all others
* Unintended synergies emerge
* Dominant strategies appear

**Example:**

```
Original: 10 weapons, balanced
Add: 90 more weapons over 2 years
Result:
- Weapon 76 + Weapon 43 = overpowered combo
- Weapons 1-30 obsolete (power crept)
- 40 weapons never used (overshadowed)
- Testing all interactions impossible (4950 pairs)
```

**How to avoid:**

* Set content bounds from start (Part 8)
* Tier system (new content in higher tier, old tier separate)
* Rebalance periodically (every 20-30 additions)
* Modular design (new content doesn't interact with old)

**Recovery if caught:**

* Game has 100+ items, many broken
* Implement tier system (Part 8)
* OR level/content squish
* OR prune worst offenders (remove broken items)

***

## Pitfall 11: Playtesting With Wrong Players

**Symptom:** Expert playtesters say "too easy," real players say "impossible."

**Why it fails:**

* Playtesters are designers or highly skilled
* Biased sample (not representative of target audience)
* Balance feels perfect to experts, broken to average players

**Example:**

```
Designer playtests own boss fight:
- Knows patterns (designed them)
- Optimized build (knows system deeply)
- Beats boss first try

Real player encounters boss:
- Doesn't know patterns (must learn)
- Suboptimal build (new to system)
- Dies 30 times, quits frustrated

Same boss, different experience.
```

**How to avoid:**

* Playtest with target audience (not just friends/designers)
* Include range of skill levels (novice to expert)
* Fresh eyes (players who don't know your design)
* Part 7: playtester selection guidelines

**Recovery if caught:**

* Launch reveals difficulty mismatch
* Emergency patch (quick difficulty adjustment)
* Expand playtester pool for future

***

## Pitfall 12: Confusing Math Correctness with Fun

**Symptom:** "The expected value is perfect" but players hate it.

**Why it fails:**

* Math says boss fight lasts 23.4 rounds (target: 23)
* Players say fight is boring
* Optimized for duration, ignored engagement

**Example:**

```
Boss fight analysis:
- Time-to-Kill: 23.2 rounds ✓
- Hit rates: 61% player, 69% boss ✓
- DPR: 23.8 player, 15.7 boss ✓

All numbers perfect!

Player feedback:
- "Just attacked same way 23 times, boring"
- "No strategy, just roll dice"
- "Nothing interesting happened"

Mathematically correct, experientially bad.
```

**Why this happens:**

* Math can't measure fun
* Numbers can't capture pattern interest, tension, satisfaction
* Expected value ignores variance, edge cases, player creativity

**How to avoid:**

* Optimize for experience measurables, not just math (Part 5)
* Consequence Severity, Pattern Consistency, Mastery Curve matter
* Playtest experience, not just numbers
* Math is necessary but not sufficient

**Recovery if caught:**

* Numbers check out but experience wrong
* Return to aesthetic goals (what experience do we want?)
* Add depth (patterns, choices, tension)
* Retest experience

***

## Pitfall 13: No Clear Win/Loss Conditions

**Symptom:** "Players aren't sure if they won or lost."

**Why it fails:**

* Framework without resolution = endless negotiation
* No stakes because no clear failure state
* Choices meaningless if outcomes ambiguous

**Example:**

```
Investigation system:
- Players investigate, gain information
- But no clear success/failure
- GM always says "you learn something"
- Players unsure if they're succeeding

Result: No tension, stakes unclear, investigation feels pointless.
```

**How to avoid:**

* Define victory conditions (what does success look like?)
* Define failure conditions (what does failure look like?)
* Make outcomes clear (you succeeded/failed at X)
* Test: Can players articulate if they won?

**Recovery if caught:**

* Playtest feedback: "Not sure what we're trying to do"
* Add explicit goals (investigate 3 of 6 boss properties)
* Add clear stakes (boss impossible with \<2 properties known)
* Make progress visible (track discovered properties)

***

## Pitfall 14: Ignoring Player Feedback Loop

**Symptom:** Players can't tell what they did wrong when they fail.

**Why it fails:**

* Die without understanding why
* Can't improve because don't know mistake
* Frustration instead of learning

**Example:**

```
Boss fight:
- Player dies
- Doesn't know: Was positioning wrong? Build wrong? Tactics wrong? Just bad luck?
- Tries again, dies again
- Still doesn't know what to change
- Quits frustrated
```

**How to avoid:**

* Clear feedback (visible telegraphs, damage numbers, status effects)
* Distinguish player error from bad luck (consistent patterns)
* Make correct play obvious in hindsight
* Ask playtesters: "Why did you die?" (if they can't answer, feedback insufficient)

**Recovery if caught:**

* Players quit saying "I don't know what I'm supposed to do"
* Add telegraphs (visual/audio warnings)
* Add damage numbers (show what hurt)
* Add pattern consistency (same mistake = same outcome)

***

## Pitfall 15: Feature Creep

**Symptom:** "Let's add one more system..."

**Why it fails:**

* Every system adds complexity
* Interactions multiply exponentially
* Balance becomes impossible to manage
* Players overwhelmed

**Example:**

```
Started with: HP, Damage, Armor (3 resources)
Added: Mana, Stamina, Rage, Focus, Combo Points, Energy, Heat, Shield, Ward (9 more resources)
Now: 12 resources to track
Plus: 15 status effects, 30 abilities, 50 items

Players: [drowning in complexity]
Designer: [can't balance all interactions]
```

**How to avoid:**

* Set complexity budget (Part 6: choose resolution mechanic based on simplicity)
* Resist feature addition (every addition costs balance)
* Remove more than add (simplify existing before adding)
* Ask: "Does this serve aesthetic?" (if no, cut it)

**Recovery if caught:**

* Game unmanageably complex
* Prune ruthlessly (remove least-used systems)
* Consolidate (merge similar resources)
* Simplify (reduce status effects, abilities)

***

## Red Flags Checklist

**If you see these, stop and address:**

* [ ] Can't explain why you chose these numbers
* [ ] Players doing unexpected things constantly (paradigm mismatch)
* [ ] Experience feels wrong despite correct numbers
* [ ] Spending weeks calculating, not playtesting
* [ ] Boss HP set without knowing player damage
* [ ] Fight duration varies 5-45 minutes
* [ ] Framework takes 5+ minutes to apply

## How to Avoid All Pitfalls

**The meta-pattern:**

1. **Use the framework** (don't wing it)
2. **Match paradigm to aesthetic** (compatibility matrix, Part 2)
3. **Optimize right measurables** (aesthetic-specific, Part 5)
4. **Work systematically** (Part 6 process)
5. **Playtest early** (Part 7, don't wait for perfect)
6. **Integrate systems** (make them talk to each other)
7. **Test with target audience** (not just experts)
8. **Measure experience, not just math** (emotional measurables matter)
9. **Limit complexity** (resist feature creep)
10. **Listen to feedback** (players tell you what's wrong)

**Most pitfalls trace back to:** Skipping a step in the framework or ignoring player feedback.

**The framework exists because these pitfalls are common.** Use it.
