# Part 6: From Measurables to Numbers

You've identified your priority measurables. Now: how do you turn "Time-to-Kill should be 5-7 minutes" into "Boss has 540 HP"?

This part shows you the actual derivation process—from abstract targets to concrete parameters.

We'll cover:

1. Choosing resolution mechanics
2. Setting parameters within each paradigm
3. Integration across systems
4. Using LLMs to assist calibration
5. Worked examples

***

## Section 1: Choosing Resolution Mechanics

Before you can set HP and damage values, you need to know **how actions resolve**. Different resolution mechanics serve different paradigms and aesthetics.

### Why This Matters First

**You can't set parameters without knowing the resolution system:**

* "Boss has 500 HP" meaningless without knowing damage scale
* "Player deals 15 damage" meaningless without knowing hit rate
* "60% success chance" requires specific dice mechanic

**Resolution mechanic determines:**

* How you calculate probabilities
* What granularity is possible
* How much variance exists
* How fast resolution occurs

### Decision Framework for Resolution Mechanics

**Step 1: Identify your requirements from measurables**

From Part 5, check your priority measurables for:

**Transparency requirement:**

* Risk Visibility HIGH → Need transparent odds (players can calculate)
* Risk Visibility LOW → Opaque mechanics acceptable

**Speed requirement:**

* Decision Frequency high → Need fast resolution (\<10 seconds per action)
* Decision Frequency moderate → Can afford slower resolution

**Granularity requirement:**

* Partial success important (Framework, Narrative) → Need ternary outcomes (fail/partial/success)
* Binary sufficient (Consistency, Challenge) → Success/fail works

**Player control requirement:**

* Agency Scope TACTICAL+ → Need modifiers, choices affecting roll
* Agency Scope MECHANICAL → Simple pass/fail sufficient

**Step 2: Match requirements to resolution mechanics**

### Resolution Mechanic Library

#### 2d6 + Modifiers (PbtA-style)

**Properties:**

* **Transparency:** HIGH (bell curve probabilities known)
* **Speed:** FAST (one roll, immediate result)
* **Granularity:** TERNARY (6-/7-9/10+ natural breakpoints)
* **Player control:** MODERATE (modifiers shift probabilities)
* **Variance:** MODERATE (2-12 range, 7 most common)

**Probabilities:**

* 10+ (success): 41.7% base, 58.3% with +1, 72.2% with +2
* 7-9 (partial): 41.7% base, 30.6% with +1, 25.0% with +2
* 6- (failure): 16.7% base, 11.1% with +1, 2.8% with +2

**Best for:**

* Framework paradigm (ternary outcomes support complications)
* Narrative aesthetic (partial success drives story)
* Moderate decision frequency (fast resolution)
* Risk visibility HIGH (players understand probabilities)

**Examples:** Blades in the Dark, Dungeon World, Apocalypse World, Monster of the Week

**When NOT to use:**

* Need high granularity (2d6 only gives 11 outcomes)
* Want very low variance (bell curve still has spread)
* Binary success/fail sufficient (wasting ternary structure)

#### d20 + Modifiers (D\&D-style)

**Properties:**

* **Transparency:** HIGH (linear probabilities, 5% increments)
* **Speed:** FAST (one roll for attack, second for damage)
* **Granularity:** HIGH (20 outcomes for hit, variable damage dice)
* **Player control:** HIGH (many modifiers possible)
* **Variance:** HIGH (flat distribution, any outcome equally likely)

**Probabilities:**

* Linear: Each +1 = +5% hit chance
* AC 14 with +5 to hit: Need 9+ = 60% hit chance
* AC 16 with +5 to hit: Need 11+ = 50% hit chance
* Crits (natural 20) = 5%, crit fails (natural 1) = 5%

**Best for:**

* Consistency paradigm (granular control over hit rates)
* Challenge aesthetic (tactical combat with calculable odds)
* High decision frequency in combat (each action resolved quickly)
* Need separation of hit/damage (tactical depth)

**Examples:** D\&D 5e, Pathfinder, 13th Age

**When NOT to use:**

* Want partial success natively (d20 is binary, need homebrew)
* Want bounded outcomes (nat 1 and nat 20 create extreme results)
* Players want less math (modifiers can stack extensively)

#### Dice Pool (Count Successes)

**Properties:**

* **Transparency:** LOW (hard to calculate probabilities mentally)
* **Speed:** MODERATE (roll multiple dice, count successes)
* **Granularity:** CONTINUOUS (0 to N successes)
* **Player control:** HIGH (build pool through choices)
* **Variance:** MODERATE to LOW (more dice = more consistent)

**Probabilities (d6, success on 5-6):**

* 1d6: 33% 1+ success
* 2d6: 55% 1+ success, 11% 2+ success
* 3d6: 70% 1+ success, 26% 2+ success, 4% 3+ success
* 4d6: 80% 1+ success, 40% 2+ success, 13% 3+ success

**Best for:**

* Framework paradigm (successes = Effect level)
* Resource-building mechanics (spend for dice)
* Want player control over risk (more dice = less variance)
* Narrative focus (drama of roll matters more than calculation)

**Examples:** Blades in the Dark (Position/Effect), World of Darkness, Shadowrun, Burning Wheel

**When NOT to use:**

* Need fast resolution (counting slower than single die)
* Want transparent odds (players can't calculate easily)
* Limited table space or digital implementation (many dice to track)

#### Simple d6 (OSR-style)

**Properties:**

* **Transparency:** HIGH (six outcomes, easy to remember)
* **Speed:** VERY FAST (one die, instant resolution)
* **Granularity:** LOW (only 6 outcomes)
* **Player control:** LOW to MODERATE (few modifiers)
* **Variance:** HIGH (16.7% per outcome)

**Probabilities:**

* Target number 4+: 50% success
* Target number 5+: 33% success
* Target number 6+: 16% success (only on 6)

**Best for:**

* Consistency paradigm (fast resolution)
* Minimal mechanical complexity (more brainspace for tactics)
* Old-school aesthetic (classic feel)
* Quick adjudication needed

**Examples:** Into the Odd, Maze Rats, Cairn, many OSR games

**When NOT to use:**

* Need granular control (only 6 outcomes)
* Want significant player control (limited modifier space)
* Need to distinguish small differences (not enough resolution)

#### Narrative/Token-Based (Fate-style)

**Properties:**

* **Transparency:** MODERATE (understand economy but not probabilities)
* **Speed:** FAST (spend tokens, narrate outcome)
* **Granularity:** NARRATIVE (success determined by fiction + tokens)
* **Player control:** VERY HIGH (players spend tokens to shape outcomes)
* **Variance:** LOW (outcomes negotiated, not random)

**Mechanics:**

* Players have tokens/points (Fate points, story tokens, bennies)
* Spend tokens to: succeed automatically, add details, reroll, invoke aspects
* GM gives tokens when: players accept complications, engage disadvantages
* Success/failure negotiated using tokens + dice or tokens alone

**Best for:**

* Framework paradigm (negotiation is core)
* Narrative aesthetic (story takes precedence over mechanics)
* High agency scope (players shape outcomes directly)
* Want to minimize randomness (tokens reduce variance)

**Examples:** Fate Core, Cortex Prime, various story games

**When NOT to use:**

* Challenge aesthetic (token spending replaces skill expression)
* Want objective difficulty (negotiation makes it subjective)
* Players prefer tactical/mechanical focus over narrative control

### Matching Requirements to Mechanics: Decision Table

\| Need | 2d6 | d20 | Dice Pool | d6 | Tokens |
\|------|-----|-----|-----------|----|----- --|
\| Transparent odds | ✓✓ | ✓✓✓ | ✗ | ✓✓✓ | ○ |
\| Fast resolution | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✓ | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓ |
\| Partial success | ✓✓✓ | ○ | ✓✓ | ○ | ✓✓✓ |
\| High granularity | ○ | ✓✓✓ | ✓✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
\| Player control | ✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓✓ | ○ | ✓✓✓ |
\| Low variance | ✓ | ✗ | ✓✓ | ✗ | ✓✓✓ |

**Legend:** ✓✓✓ = Excellent, ✓✓ = Good, ✓ = Adequate, ○ = Possible but not ideal, ✗ = Poor fit

### Step 3: Choose Your Mechanic

**For our Village Mystery + Boss Fight scenario:**

**Investigation phase requirements:**

* Transparent odds: HIGH (Framework requires risk visibility)
* Fast resolution: YES (12-15 actions in 3 hours = \~10 min each)
* Partial success: ESSENTIAL (Framework paradigm, Narrative aesthetic)
* Player control: MODERATE (modifiers from preparation)

**Match: 2d6 + modifiers**

* ✓✓ Transparent (players know 10+ = success)
* ✓✓✓ Fast (one roll)
* ✓✓✓ Partial success (7-9 built in)
* ✓ Player control (modifiers available)

**Boss fight requirements:**

* Transparent odds: HIGH (players need to calculate tactics)
* Fast resolution: YES (4 players × 6 rounds = 24 actions in 2 hours)
* Granularity: HIGH (need HP/damage tracking for 20+ round fight)
* Binary ok: SUCCESS/FAIL sufficient (hit/miss, damage rolled separately)

**Match: d20 + AC system**

* ✓✓✓ Transparent (linear probabilities)
* ✓✓ Fast (attack roll + damage roll)
* ✓✓✓ Granular (20 outcomes for hit, variable damage)
* Works for Consistency paradigm (fixed AC, learnable hit rates)

**Note: Different mechanics for different phases is valid hybrid approach.**

## Section 2: Setting Parameters Within Paradigms

Once you've chosen resolution mechanics, you can set actual numbers. The process differs by paradigm.

### Framework Paradigm: Setting Tier Ranges

**Framework doesn't set exact values—it sets ranges for each tier.**

#### Step 1: Define Framework Dimensions

**Choose your framework axes** (typically 2-3):

* **Risk axis:** How dangerous? (3 tiers typical)
* **Effect axis:** What's accomplished? (3 tiers typical)
* **Consequence types:** What goes wrong? (4-6 types)

**For Village Mystery investigation:**

* Risk: Low / Medium / High
* Information Gain: Minor / Major / Critical
* Consequences: Time lost, Alert raised, Path closed, Danger increased

#### Step 2: Set Ranges for Risk Tiers

**What does each risk level threaten?**

Using 2d6 resolution (6- = consequence occurs):

**Low Risk:**

* **Probability of consequence:** 16.7% base (6- on 2d6)
* **Typical consequence:** Minor (time lost, need different approach)
* **No catastrophic outcomes**

**Medium Risk:**

* **Probability of consequence:** 16.7% base, BUT consequence more severe
* **Typical consequence:** Moderate (alert raised +1, path closes, complication)
* **Can create problems but not end investigation**

**High Risk:**

* **Probability of consequence:** 16.7% base, BUT consequence severe
* **Typical consequence:** Major (danger level increases significantly, lose opportunity permanently)
* **Can make situation notably worse**

**Modifier ranges:**

* Low Risk: +1 to roll (reduces failure chance to 11.1%)
* Medium Risk: +0 to roll (16.7% failure)
* High Risk: -1 to roll (27.8% failure)

#### Step 3: Set Ranges for Effect Tiers

**What does each effect level provide?**

**Minor Information:**

* 1-2 preparation points (usable in boss fight)
* OR hint about boss (not full revelation)
* Useful but not game-changing

**Major Information:**

* 3-4 preparation points
* OR reveal one boss weakness/pattern
* OR unlock one tactical option
* Significantly helpful

**Critical Information:**

* 5-6 preparation points
* OR reveal major boss secret + unlock powerful tactical option
* Game-changing advantage

**Total available across investigation:**

* \~12-15 investigation actions possible
* Average yield if playing well: 25-30 preparation points, 3-4 tactical unlocks, knowledge of 3-4 boss properties
* This becomes input to boss fight parameters

#### Step 4: Create GM Guidance

**Not formulas, but principles for application:**

**Risk determination:**

* Low: You're prepared, opposition weak/unaware, safe location
* Medium: Standard danger, opposition capable, some exposure
* High: Outmatched, opposition strong, exposed position

**Effect determination:**

* Minor: Approach indirect, limited time/resources
* Major: Approach suited, adequate resources
* Critical: Perfect approach, excellent resources, ideal circumstances

**Consequence selection:**

* Choose consequence that drives story forward
* Match severity to Risk level
* Avoid dead ends (even High Risk consequences should create new situations)

#### Step 5: Test Framework Consistency

**Can GM apply framework consistently?**

Present same scenario to GM multiple times:

* Do they give same Risk/Effect?
* Present to multiple GMs: Do they agree within 1 tier?
* Do players understand framework well enough to predict stakes?

**If not:** Add more examples, clarify guidance, provide edge case rulings.

### Consistency Paradigm: Calculating Fixed Values

**Consistency sets exact numbers that enable pattern learning.**

#### Step 1: Define Power Baseline

**Choose your reference point** (player power level):

**For Village Mystery boss fight:**

* "Level 3" power equivalent (our design choice)
* Player HP: 20 (enough for mistakes, not infinite)
* Player to-hit: +5 to +7 (average +6)
* Player damage per hit: 8-10 (average 9)
* 4 players total

**Why this matters:** All other numbers derive from player baseline.

#### Step 2: Calculate Time-to-Kill Target

**From measurables (Part 5):**

* Target boss fight duration: 2 hours
* Players take turns, then boss acts: \~1 round per 5 minutes
* Target: 20-25 rounds total

**Player damage per round:**

* 4 players each attack
* Against boss AC (to be determined), let's assume 65% hit rate
* Average damage per hit: 9
* DPR (Damage Per Round) = 4 players × 9 damage × 65% hit = 23.4 damage

**Boss HP from DPR:**

* Target 23 rounds (middle of 20-25)
* Boss HP = 23 rounds × 23.4 DPR = **538 HP**
* Round to **540 HP** (clean number)

**Validation with investigation advantages:**

* Good investigation adds \~30-40% effective DPR (unlocks, preparation)
* Enhanced DPR = 23.4 × 1.35 = 31.6 DPR
* Fight duration with advantages: 540 / 31.6 = **17 rounds** (within target of 15-18)

#### Step 3: Set Threat Level

**From measurables:**

* Consequence Severity: HIGH
* Target: Boss can incapacitate player in 3-4 hits

**Player effective HP:**

* Raw HP: 20
* Assume some damage mitigation (armor, positioning): \~30% reduction
* Effective HP: 20 / (1 - 0.30) ≈ 28 effective HP

**Boss damage:**

* 28 effective HP / 3.5 hits = 8 damage per hit
* Using dice: 2d6+1 = 8 average (range 3-13)

**Boss attack frequency:**

* 2 attacks per round (threaten multiple players, require coordination)
* Total boss DPR = 2 × 8 = 16 damage per round
* Against team (80 HP total): Team can survive \~5 rounds of full boss damage

**This creates tension:** Boss deals 16 DPR, team deals 23.4 DPR. Team wins math but slowly—must play well.

#### Step 4: Set Hit Probabilities

**Boss AC calculation:**

**Target player hit rate: 60-70%** (frequent enough for progress, occasional misses for tension)

Using d20 + modifier:

* Player to-hit bonus: +6 average
* For 65% hit rate: Need to roll 8+ on d20
* 8+ on d20 = 13+ total with +6 bonus
* Boss AC = 13 becomes target

**But:** Boss is major threat, should be harder to hit

**Adjusted: Boss AC = 15**

* Player needs 9+ on d20 with +6 = 15 total
* Hit chance = 60% (12 outcomes of 20 succeed)
* Slightly harder, appropriate for boss

**Boss to-hit against players:**

Players have some defense. Assume player AC \~14 (light armor/decent Dex)

Boss to-hit bonus: +7 (skilled threat)

* Needs 7+ on d20 = 70% hit rate
* Boss is dangerous, hits most attacks
* But players have 30% chance to dodge (creates tension)

#### Step 5: Design Patterns

**From measurables:**

* Pattern Consistency: HIGH
* Patterns must be learnable

**Boss attack patterns** (fixed sequence):

**Pattern 1: Basic Attacks (Rounds 1-8)**

* Attack 1: Swipe (targets closest player, 2d6+1 damage)
* Attack 2: Stab (targets second-closest, 2d6+1 damage)
* Repeat until Phase 2

**Pattern 2: Charge Telegraph (Round 3, 6, 9...)**

* Every 3rd round: Roar and rear back (telegraph)
* Next round: Charge in line, 3d6+3 damage to first target hit (\~13.5 damage, very dangerous)
* **Learnable:** Players see telegraph, can reposition
* **Investigation unlock:** "Interrupt charge with heavy hit during roar"

**Pattern 3: Phase Transition (50% HP, 270 damage taken)**

* Visual change (eyes glow, stance shifts)
* Gains +1 attack per round (now 3 attacks)
* **Learnable:** Happens at HP threshold
* **Investigation unlock:** "Prepare defensive buffs at 50%"

**Pattern 4: AOE Sweep (Phase 2, every 4th round)**

* Wind-up: Weapon spins (1 round telegraph)
* Execute: All adjacent players take 2d6 damage
* **Learnable:** Players spread out after seeing telegraph
* **Investigation unlock:** "Boss off-balance after sweep, next attack has advantage"

**Pattern 5: Regeneration (Every 5 rounds if in moonlight)**

* Regains 30 HP (keeps fight from ending too early if players slow)
* **Learnable:** Pattern becomes obvious, environmental
* **Investigation unlock:** "Douse torches to block moonlight, stop regen"

**Total patterns: 5 major behaviors, all consistent and learnable**

#### Step 6: Validate Time-to-Kill

**Run simulation:**

Baseline (no investigation advantages):

* Players: 23.4 DPR
* Boss: 540 HP, regens 30 HP every 5 rounds
* Net boss HP = 540 + (6 HP per round regen) = 540 + 6×23 ≈ 680 effective
* Fight length: 680 / 23.4 ≈ 29 rounds

**Too long!** Exceeds 20-25 target.

**Adjustment:** Reduce regen to 20 HP every 5 rounds (4 HP per round)

* Effective HP: 540 + 92 = 632
* Fight length: 632 / 23.4 ≈ 27 rounds (better, high end of target)

**With investigation advantages (tactical unlocks used well):**

* Effective DPR: 31.6 (includes advantage on some attacks, interrupts, etc.)
* Boss regen partially countered (douse moonlight)
* Fight length: \~540 / 31.6 ≈ 17 rounds ✓

**Validated: Numbers hit targets.**

### Adaptive Paradigm: Setting Bounds and Rules

**Adaptive defines ranges and adaptation triggers, not fixed values.**

#### Step 1: Define Baseline Difficulty

**What's the default, before adaptation?**

**Example: 4-player co-op horde game**

Baseline parameters:

* Enemy spawn rate: 5 enemies per 30 seconds
* Enemy HP: 20 (die in 3-4 player shots)
* Enemy damage: 10 per hit
* Special enemy frequency: Every 45 seconds
* Item spawn chance: 40% at item locations

#### Step 2: Set Adaptation Ranges

**How much can each parameter vary?**

**Enemy spawn rate range:**

* Minimum: 2 enemies per 30 sec (help struggling team)
* Maximum: 10 enemies per 30 sec (challenge successful team)
* Ratio: 5x variation

**Special enemy frequency range:**

* Minimum: Every 90 seconds (give breaks)
* Maximum: Every 20 seconds (intense pressure)
* Ratio: 4.5x variation

**Item spawn chance range:**

* Minimum: 20% (items rare, must play well)
* Maximum: 80% (items common, help recovery)
* Ratio: 4x variation

**Enemy HP/damage:**

* HP range: ±30% (14-26 HP)
* Damage range: ±20% (8-12 damage)
* Keeps core feel while adjusting difficulty

#### Step 3: Define State Tracking

**What does system monitor?**

**Per player:**

* Current HP (0-100)
* Ammo remaining
* Deaths/incapacitations (last 5 minutes)
* Damage dealt (contribution to team)
* Distance from teammates (isolation tracking)

**Team aggregate:**

* Average HP across all players
* Progress rate (distance/objectives vs. expected)
* Time since last intensity peak
* Recent team deaths (last 2 minutes)

**Intensity tracking:**

* Current intensity level (0-100 scale)
* Time in current phase (build/peak/relax)
* Cumulative intensity (session total)

#### Step 4: Create Adaptation Rules

**When does system adjust?**

**Help struggling team:**

```
IF team_avg_HP < 40%
  THEN increase item_spawn_chance (40% → 60%)
  AND reduce_spawn_rate (5 → 3.5 enemies/30sec)

IF multiple_players_incapacitated_simultaneously
  THEN reduce_spawn_rate (5 → 2 enemies/30sec)
  AND delay_next_special (add 30 seconds to timer)
  AND spawn_health_items (guarantee at next location)

IF team_wiped_in_last_2_minutes
  THEN easier_enemy_composition (fewer specials)
  AND increase_item_spawns (+20% for next 5 minutes)
```

**Challenge successful team:**

```
IF no_deaths_last_5_minutes AND team_progress_fast
  THEN spawn_mini_boss (create challenge spike)
  AND increase_spawn_rate (5 → 7 enemies/30sec)

IF all_players_HP > 75% for 3+ minutes
  THEN reduce_item_spawns (40% → 25%)
  AND increase_special_frequency (45sec → 35sec)

IF one_player_far_ahead (lone_wolf behavior)
  THEN spawn_specials_targeting_them
  AND increase_spawns_in_their_area
```

**Pacing rules (independent of performance):**

```
Every 2-3 minutes:
  - Build phase (60-90 sec): Gradually increase spawn_rate (3 → 7)
  - Peak phase (15-30 sec): Maximum intensity (spawn_rate = 9-10)
  - Relax phase (30-45 sec): Minimal spawns (spawn_rate = 1-2)

Cycle varies in intensity:
  - Not every peak same strength
  - Occasionally very high peak (mini-boss spawn)
  - Relief phases sacred (never skip, needed for recovery)
```

#### Step 5: Set Hard Bounds

**What are absolute limits?**

**Never exceed:**

* Spawn rate: 12 enemies per 30 seconds (performance/overwhelming)
* Simultaneous specials: 3 maximum (more = chaos)
* Zero item spawns: Always 15% minimum
* Instant death situations: Boss attacks telegraphed, avoidable

**Always provide:**

* Winning chance: Even struggling team has path (help eventually enough)
* Revive mechanics: Can recover teammates
* Ammo: Won't run completely dry (stingier but never zero)
* Information: Dangers telegraphed (no invisible instant deaths)

#### Step 6: Test Adaptation Subtlety

**Can players notice the adaptation?**

**Good signs:**

* Players attribute difficulty changes to "good/bad luck"
* Players don't feel patronized or cheated
* Adaptation gradual (not sudden swings)

**Bad signs:**

* Players say "the game is helping me" (too obvious)
* Players intentionally trigger "help" states (exploitable)
* Players say "the game is cheating" (too aggressive)

**Tuning:**

* Make adjustments 10-20% at a time (not 50%+)
* Space adjustments (not every 30 seconds)
* Attribute to "wave variation" not "adaptation"

***

## Section 3: Integration Across Systems

When different subsystems use different paradigms (hybrid), you need integration layer.

### Integration Principle

**Two subsystems can only integrate if they share mechanical language.**

**Example: Investigation (Framework) + Boss Fight (Consistency)**

**Shared language options:**

1. **Resource pool:** Investigation generates points, boss fight spends points
2. **Unlocks:** Investigation reveals options, boss fight uses options
3. **State changes:** Investigation modifies boss fight parameters

**For Village Mystery, we use #1 and #2:**

### Integration Mechanism 1: Preparation Pool

**Investigation generates resource:**

* Minor information: 1-2 preparation points
* Major information: 3-4 preparation points
* Critical information: 5-6 preparation points
* Total available: \~25-30 points with good investigation

**Boss fight spends resource:**

* Reroll any d20: 5 points
* Gain advantage on roll: 3 points
* Take extra action this turn: 10 points
* Emergency heal (10 HP): 7 points
* Defensive stance (+2 AC until next turn): 5 points

**Why this works:**

* Converts abstract "investigation success" into concrete "tactical resource"
* Players understand what investigation gains
* Boss fight doesn't need to know HOW points were earned
* Resource scarcity maintains tension (can't spam)

**Tuning the economy:**

Points earned (25-30) vs points needed:

* 5 emergency heals = 35 points (would need excellent investigation + some choices)
* 5 rerolls + 5 advantages = 40 points (more than available, must choose)
* 2 extra actions + 3 heals + mixed = \~41 points (again, must prioritize)

**Result:** Enough to matter significantly but not enough to trivialize. Must make tough choices.

### Integration Mechanism 2: Tactical Unlocks

**Investigation reveals boss properties:**

**Knowledge system:**

* Boss has 6 discoverable properties (patterns, weaknesses, tactics)
* Each investigation success can reveal 0-1 property (based on Effect level)
* Average good investigation: Discover 3-4 of 6

**Boss properties to discover:**

1. **Charge Pattern:** Roar → Charge. Can interrupt with heavy hit during roar.
2. **Sweep Vulnerability:** After AOE sweep, boss off-balance. Next attack has advantage.
3. **Regeneration Condition:** Regens in moonlight. Douse torches to stop regen.
4. **Phase Threshold:** Enrages at 50% HP. Can prepare defensive buffs if known.
5. **Weak Point - Joints:** Called shots to joints (harder to hit but double damage if hit).
6. **Fear of Loud Noise:** Bang shields together to force miss on next attack (once per fight).

**Why this works:**

* Each unlock = meaningful tactical option
* Players who investigated have concrete advantages
* Players who didn't investigate face same patterns but without counters
* Doesn't break Consistency (patterns still consistent, players just know them)

**Alternative if no investigation:**

* Players learn patterns through dying (traditional Dark Souls method)
* But no time in single session
* Investigation replaces "learning through repetition" with "learning through exploration"

### Integration Tuning

**Question: How much should investigation matter?**

**Measure: Win rate variance**

Test scenarios:

* **No investigation:** Can skilled players win? (Should be very hard but possible)
* **Minimal investigation (20%):** 10 points, 1-2 unlocks (Should be hard)
* **Good investigation (60%):** 25 points, 3-4 unlocks (Should be manageable with skill)
* **Excellent investigation (90%):** 35 points, 5-6 unlocks (Should feel powerful but not trivial)

**Target win rates:**

* No investigation: 20% (very difficult, possible with excellent play)
* Minimal: 40% (challenging)
* Good: 70% (winnable with decent play)
* Excellent: 90% (likely win unless major mistakes)

**If investigation matters too much:**

* No investigation becomes impossible (bad—punishes player choice)
* Fix: Reduce boss HP or damage

**If investigation matters too little:**

* Excellent investigation still only 60% win rate (bad—wasted 3 hours investigating)
* Fix: More powerful tactical unlocks or more preparation points

***

## Section 4: Using LLMs to Assist Calibration

LLMs can help with number-setting, but require proper guidance.

### What LLMs Can Help With

**1. Simulating many playthroughs**

Ask LLM to simulate:

* 100 boss fights with given parameters
* Track win rate, average duration, cause of death
* Identify edge cases or dominant strategies

**2. Calculating probabilities**

Ask LLM to calculate:

* Expected damage per round given hit rates and damage rolls
* Probability distributions for fight duration
* Likelihood of specific outcomes (player death, boss phase transitions)

**3. Suggesting starting values**

Ask LLM to suggest:

* "Boss HP for 20-round fight given player DPR of 23.4"
* "Damage to incapacitate in 3-4 hits given player HP 20"
* Comparative values from similar games

**4. Identifying balance issues**

Ask LLM to critique:

* "Can players exploit this system?"
* "What happens if players focus-fire this pattern?"
* "Are there unintended interactions between these mechanics?"

### What LLMs Cannot Do (Need Human)

**1. Judge subjective "feel"**

* Does 65% hit rate feel good? (Need playtesting)
* Is this consequence satisfying? (Need player feedback)
* Does boss fight feel epic? (Aesthetic judgment)

**2. Understand your specific aesthetic goals**

* LLM doesn't know your Narrative vs Challenge priorities
* Can't weight measurables without explicit instruction
* Needs you to specify "more important: duration stability or difficulty accommodation?"

**3. Create content**

* LLM won't design interesting boss patterns
* Won't create flavorful consequences
* Won't generate compelling investigation clues

**4. Validate with real play**

* Math checks out ≠ actually fun
* Simulation ≠ human behavior
* Always playtest with real humans

### LLM Workflow Example

**Prompt structure for LLM number-checking:**

```
I'm designing a boss fight with these parameters:

CONTEXT:
- 4 players, "level 3" power (20 HP, +6 to hit, 9 damage average)
- Boss fight target: 20-25 rounds (2 hours real-time)
- Resolution: d20 + modifier
- Aesthetic: Challenge (Consistency paradigm)

CURRENT PARAMETERS:
- Boss HP: 540
- Boss AC: 15
- Boss damage: 2d6+1 (8 average), 2 attacks per round
- Boss regenerates 20 HP every 5 rounds
- Player hit chance: 60% (need 9+ on d20 with +6)
- Boss hit chance: 70% (need 7+ on d20 with +7 vs AC 14)

QUESTIONS:
1. Calculate expected fight duration with these parameters
2. What's the probability of player death (any player below 0 HP)?
3. If players have 25 preparation points to spend on advantages, how much does that change expected duration?
4. Are there edge cases or exploits I'm missing?
```

**What LLM can provide:**

* Math: Fight duration \~27 rounds baseline (need to reduce regen)
* Probability: \~40% chance at least one player incapacitated
* With advantages: Duration reduces to \~18 rounds (good)
* Potential exploit: "Players could all focus defensive stance, outlast boss regen" (need to test)

**What you decide:**

* Is 27 rounds acceptable or should reduce regen? (Judgment call)
* Is 40% incapacitation rate appropriate for Challenge aesthetic? (Aesthetic decision)
* Do tactical unlocks create interesting decisions or dominant strategy? (Playtest needed)

### LLM Prompt Templates

**Template 1: Expected value calculation**

```
Calculate expected damage per round:
- 4 players

## Section 5: Worked Examples

Let's see complete derivations using this process.

### Example 1: Framework Investigation System (Fully Worked)

**Context:**

* Tabletop, 1 GM, 4 players
* 3-hour investigation phase
* Aesthetic: Narrative + Discovery
* Paradigm: Framework

**Step 1: Choose resolution mechanic**

* Requirements: Transparent odds, Fast, Partial success essential
* Choice: 2d6 + modifiers

**Step 2: Define framework**

* Risk: Low (+1) / Medium (+0) / High (-1)
* Information: Minor (1-2 points) / Major (3-4 points) / Critical (5-6 points)
* Consequences: Time lost, Alert raised, Path closed, Danger increased

**Step 3: Set time budget**

* 3 hours = 180 minutes
* Target: 12-15 meaningful actions
* \~12 minutes per action (including RP, discussion, resolution)

**Step 4: Set total rewards available**

* 15 actions × average Major information (3.5 points) = 52 points theoretical maximum
* Realistic with mix of success/failure: \~25-30 points
* Plus: 3-4 tactical unlocks from specific investigations
* Plus: 3-4 boss properties revealed

**Step 5: Create GM guidance**

Risk assessment:

* Low: Sneaking past distracted guard, investigating safe area, well-prepared approach
* Medium: Confronting aware guard, investigating guarded location, standard risk
* High: Infiltrating heavily guarded area, confronting dangerous NPC, exposed position

Effect assessment:

* Minor: Indirect investigation, limited time, asking general questions
* Major: Direct investigation, adequate time, specific questions, good approach
* Critical: Perfect circumstance, excellent preparation, ideal approach, lucky break

**Step 6: Create example applications**

\[Include 5-10 examples like:]

*"Player wants to sneak past guard to reach study"*

* Risk: Medium (guard is alert but player has shadows to hide in)
* Effect: Standard (reaching study is full goal)
* On 10+: Reach study undetected
* On 7-9: Reach study BUT guard heard something, will investigate soon (time pressure added)
* On 6-: Don't reach study, guard spots you (alert raised)

**Step 7: Test with GM**

* Present scenarios, check GM assigns consistent Risk/Effect
* Calibrate if needed

### Example 2: Consistency Boss Fight (Fully Worked in Step-by-Step)

\[We did this above in Section 2, full derivation from baseline through validation]

### Example 3: Adaptive Difficulty for Co-op Horde Game

**Context:**

* Digital, 4-player co-op
* 45-minute sessions
* Aesthetic: Fellowship + Tension
* Paradigm: Adaptive

**Step 1: Define baseline**

* Enemy spawn: 5 per 30 seconds
* Enemy HP: 20 (3 shots to kill)
* Enemy damage: 10 per hit
* Special frequency: Every 45 seconds
* Item spawn: 40% chance

**Step 2: Set ranges (calculated above in Section 2)**

**Step 3: Define tracking**

* Monitor: Team avg HP, progress rate, deaths, isolation

**Step 4: Create adaptation rules**

* Help triggers: Avg HP \< 40%, multiple incaps, recent wipe
* Challenge triggers: No deaths 5 min, all HP > 75%, fast progress
* Pacing cycles: Independent 2-3 min cycles

**Step 5: Set bounds**

* Max spawn: 12 per 30 sec (performance limit)
* Min items: 15% (never zero)
* Always winnable (system provides path)

**Step 6: Validate subtlety**

* Playtest: Can players notice adaptation?
* Adjust if too obvious
* Check for exploits

## Quick Reference: Paradigm-Specific Workflows

### Framework Paradigm Checklist

1. ✓ Choose resolution mechanic (2d6 or dice pool recommended)
2. ✓ Define 2-3 framework dimensions (Risk, Effect, Consequences)
3. ✓ Set 3 tiers per dimension (more = too complex)
4. ✓ Define ranges for each tier (not exact values)
5. ✓ Create GM guidance (principles not formulas)
6. ✓ Write 5-10 example applications (calibrate intuition)
7. ✓ Test with GM (consistent application?)

### Consistency Paradigm Checklist

1. ✓ Choose resolution mechanic (d20 or simple d6 recommended)
2. ✓ Define player power baseline (HP, to-hit, damage)
3. ✓ Calculate time-to-kill target (from measurables)
4. ✓ Work backwards to enemy HP (DPR × rounds)
5. ✓ Set threat level (how many hits to kill player?)
6. ✓ Calculate hit rates (what AC/defense creates target percentages?)
7. ✓ Design 3-5 learnable patterns (consistent behaviors)
8. ✓ Validate time-to-kill (simulate or calculate)

### Adaptive Paradigm Checklist

1. ✓ Choose resolution mechanic (any works, typically d20 for precision)
2. ✓ Define baseline difficulty (before adaptation)
3. ✓ Set adaptation ranges (±30-50% typical)
4. ✓ Define state tracking (what to monitor)
5. ✓ Create adaptation rules (help and challenge triggers)
6. ✓ Design pacing cycles (build/peak/relax)
7. ✓ Set hard bounds (maximums and minimums)
8. ✓ Test subtlety (too obvious = bad)

## Common Pitfalls in Number-Setting

### Pitfall 1: Setting Numbers Without Resolution Mechanic

**Symptom:** "Boss has 500 HP" without knowing damage scale or hit rates
**Problem:** Can't validate if 500 is right without knowing how fast it depletes
**Fix:** Choose resolution mechanic first, then set HP based on DPR calculations

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Variance

**Symptom:** Calculations use average damage but ignore swingy results
**Problem:** 2d6 (2-12) has different feel than 7 flat damage even though average is 7
**Fix:** Consider variance in your calculations, test edge cases (low rolls, high rolls)

### Pitfall 3: Framework Too Complex

**Symptom:** 5+ tiers per dimension, 10+ consequence types
**Problem:** GM can't apply consistently, players can't predict
**Fix:** Simplify to 3 tiers, 4-6 consequence types

### Pitfall 4: Consistency Without Patterns

**Symptom:** Boss has fixed stats but random behavior
**Problem:** Can't learn patterns if behavior random
**Fix:** Create 3-5 clear, repeating patterns with telegraphs

### Pitfall 5: Adaptive Too Obvious

**Symptom:** Players notice difficulty changes, feel patronized or cheated
**Problem:** Breaks immersion, feels manipulative
**Fix:** Gradual adjustments (10-20%), space them out, attribute to natural variation

### Pitfall 6: Integration Mismatch

**Symptom:** Investigation results don't translate to boss fight advantages
**Problem:** Players wasted time investigating with no payoff
**Fix:** Create explicit integration (resource pool or unlocks)

### Pitfall 7: No Validation

**Symptom:** Set numbers based on intuition, never tested
**Problem:** Numbers often wrong by 50%+ until tested
**Fix:** Always calculate expected outcomes, then playtest
