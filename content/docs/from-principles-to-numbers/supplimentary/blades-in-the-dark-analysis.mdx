# Blades in the Dark - Balance Analysis

## 1. Game Overview

**Title:** Blades in the Dark\
**Designer:** John Harper\
**Publisher:** Evil Hat Productions (originally One Seven Design)\
**Year:** 2017\
**Platform:** Tabletop RPG\
**Players:** 2-6 (typically 1 GM + 3-5 players)\
**Session Length:** 2-6 hours\
**Campaign Length:** Ongoing series (episodic structure)

### Setting & Premise

Players are a crew of criminals in Doskvol, a haunted Victorian-era industrial city where the sun has died. The game focuses on performing "scores" (heists, assassinations, smuggling operations) while managing crew reputation, rival factions, and the consequences of criminal life.

### Core Loop

**Score → Downtime → Score**

* **Score Phase:** Perform the criminal operation (in media res, not planning)
* **Downtime Phase:** Recover stress, pursue long-term projects, indulge vices, handle consequences

**Core Loops Analysis** (Chapter 1, Section 4 Framework):

* **Micro Loop**: Describe action → GM determines position/effect → roll → immediate consequence/success → continue scene
* **Core Loop**: Accept score → gather information → plan approach → execute heist → deal with complications → handle heat/trauma → downtime → accept next score
* **Meta Loop**: Build crew reputation → expand territory → manage faction relationships → advance character playbooks → shape the city → eventually retire or fall

**Flow Profile**: Framework-based. Micro loop has instant feedback (roll immediately shows outcome). Core loop completes each session (episodic pacing). Meta loop creates campaign arc. Serves Narrative and Fellowship aesthetics.

***

## 2. Intended Aesthetic(s)

**Primary:** Narrative (desperate criminals making hard choices)\
**Secondary:** Fellowship (crew working together), Challenge (mastering Position/Effect negotiation)

**Design Goal:** Create the experience of being in a crime thriller film/TV show where:

* Characters are competent but constantly under pressure
* Plans go sideways and require improvisation
* Success comes at a cost (nothing is free)
* The crew gradually becomes hardened criminals through trauma
* Story emerges from play rather than pre-planning

**Aesthetic Success Markers:**

* Players feel tension even during successful scores
* Consequences feel meaningful and story-driven
* Players make interesting choices about risk vs. reward
* Character arcs emerge from mechanical choices (trauma, advancement)

***

## 3. Core Mechanical Systems

### Action Resolution

**Dice Pool System:**

* Roll d6s equal to action rating (0-4 dots typically)
* Read highest single die:
  * **6+:** Full success (multiple 6s = critical success with bonus advantage)
  * **4-5:** Partial success (success with consequence/complication)
  * **1-3:** Failure (don't achieve goal + consequences)
* **Zero dice:** Roll 2d6, take lowest result (cannot crit)

### Position/Effect Framework

**Position** (risk level - what happens on failure/partial):

* **Controlled:** Lower risk, milder consequences
* **Risky:** Moderate risk (default)
* **Desperate:** High risk, severe consequences

**Effect** (impact - what success achieves):

* **Limited:** Minor progress (1 tick on clock)
* **Standard:** Normal progress (2 ticks) (default)
* **Great:** Major progress (3 ticks)

**Crucially:** Position and Effect are negotiated between GM and player BEFORE the roll, creating explicit risk/reward transparency.

### Resource Systems

**Stress (Buffer Resource):**

* 9-point track
* Recovers during downtime (vice indulgence)
* Spend to:
  * Push yourself (+1d, +1 effect level, or take action when incapacitated)
  * Resist consequences (roll resistance, suffer 6-result stress)
  * Assist another character (+1d to their roll)
  * Activate flashbacks (0-2 stress depending on complexity)

**Harm (Consequence Resource):**

* 3 severity levels with limited slots:
  * **Lesser (Level 1):** 2 slots - minor penalties
  * **Moderate (Level 2):** 2 slots - -1d when relevant
  * **Severe (Level 3):** 1 slot - incapacitated unless you push yourself
  * **Fatal (Level 4):** Death/permanent consequence
* Harm escalates: if you take harm but that severity level is full, it increases one level
* Recovers slowly (requires downtime actions, healing clocks)

**Trauma:**

* Permanent when stress fills completely (9 points)
* Character gains permanent condition (Cold, Paranoid, Obsessed, etc.)
* 4 traumas = character retirement
* Does NOT recover

### Progress Clocks

* Segment circles (4, 6, or 8 segments typical)
* Track progress toward goals or dangers
* Fill based on Effect level achieved
* Used for everything: long-term projects, faction threat levels, infiltration progress, alarm systems, healing

### Other Systems

* **Load:** Pre-declared gear weight (affects starting position)
* **Flashbacks:** Pay stress to retroactively establish helpful preparation
* **Devil's Bargains:** Accept complication for +1d
* **Crew mechanics:** Shared resources, heat, wanted level, reputation

***

## 4. Balance Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Blades explicitly REJECTS mathematical power balance in favor of **framework-based dramatic balance**.

The game doesn't try to make challenges "fair" or "level-appropriate." Instead, it:

1. **Makes stakes transparent** (Position/Effect explicit before roll)
2. **Gives players agency** (can trade position for effect, resist consequences, use flashbacks)
3. **Maintains narrative consistency** (Position/Effect determined by fiction, not player level)
4. **Balances dramatic tension** (stress/harm create escalating pressure without instant death)

**Designer's Stated Intent:**
"The game's default position is that failure is inherently more interesting than success... deployed to encourage recklessness." (John Harper)

The Position/Effect framework is the game's primary balance mechanism - it creates **consistent adjudication principles** rather than numerical equivalence.

***

## 5. What Balance Problems Does This Solve?

### Problem 1: "My character wouldn't do something that stupid"

**Traditional approach:** Make challenges level-appropriate so players feel safe
**Blades approach:** Explicit Position/Effect lets players knowingly take desperate risks when it matters

### Problem 2: GM adjudication inconsistency

**Traditional approach:** GM makes rulings case-by-case, feels arbitrary
**Blades approach:** Position/Effect framework creates consistent principles everyone understands

### Problem 3: Planning paralysis

**Traditional approach:** Players spend hours planning to avoid failure
**Blades approach:** Flashbacks let you plan retroactively; stress/harm create pressure even on success

### Problem 4: Failure feels like story-stopping

**Traditional approach:** Failed roll = no progress, stalemate
**Blades approach:** Partial success = progress with complications; clocks ensure forward momentum

### Problem 5: Power escalation breaks fiction

**Traditional approach:** Characters become superhuman, setting no longer feels dangerous
**Blades approach:** Position/Effect tied to fiction not character power; a desperate situation stays desperate

***

## 6. Key Measurables

### Agency Scope

**How far decisions ripple:**

* **Immediate:** Single action resolution (one roll)
* **Score-level:** Consequences persist through current operation
* **Campaign-level:** Trauma, faction status, crew advancement permanent

**Measurement:** Trauma and crew tier changes are permanent; stress and harm temporary; individual roll outcomes matter but don't derail campaign

### Consequence Severity

**Harm levels explicitly tiered:**

* Level 1: Cosmetic/minor mechanical penalty
* Level 2: -1d when relevant (substantial)
* Level 3: Incapacitated (severe)
* Level 4: Death/permanent loss (catastrophic)

**Stress consequences:**

* 0-8 stress: Manageable
* 9+ stress: Trauma (permanent character change)
* 4 traumas: Character retirement (campaign-level consequence)

**Measurement:** Consequence severity scales with Position; GM explicitly announces position before roll

### Choice Reversibility

**Low reversibility:**

* **Cannot reverse:** Trauma, death, major faction status changes
* **Expensive to reverse:** Harm (requires downtime + recovery clocks)
* **Moderate cost to reverse:** Stress (vice indulgence, risk of overindulgence)
* **Cannot reverse but can work around:** Failed rolls (use flashbacks to reframe, but can't undo)

**Measurement:** The game creates meaningful consequences by making most choices stick. Resistance and flashbacks provide mitigation, not reversal.

### Resource Recovery Patterns

**Stress (fast recovery):**

* Recovers during downtime (1-2 per vice indulgence)
* Full recovery possible between scores
* BUT: Overindulgence creates complications
* **Recovery rate:** Per-session (renewable buffer)

**Harm (slow recovery):**

* Requires downtime actions + healing clocks
* Can take multiple sessions to recover level 3 harm
* Healing competes with other downtime activities
* **Recovery rate:** Multi-session (persistent consequence)

**Trauma (no recovery):**

* Permanent for character's lifetime
* Only "recovery" is retirement at 4 traumas
* **Recovery rate:** Never

**Design insight:** Two-tier consequence system (stress/harm) creates short-term pressure (stress) and long-term stakes (harm/trauma)

### Risk Visibility

**High visibility by design:**

* Position announced before roll (explicit risk level)
* Effect announced before roll (explicit reward level)
* Harm levels specified when threatened
* Players can negotiate position/effect before finalizing

**Measurement:** Players always know odds before committing. Transparency is feature, not bug.

### Tension Gradient

**Managed through interplay:**

* **Rising tension:** Stress accumulation during score
* **Falling tension:** Downtime recovery
* **Permanent pressure:** Harm doesn't clear quickly, trauma never clears
* **Escalation potential:** Position can worsen during score (controlled → risky → desperate)

**Measurement:** Session structure (score → downtime) creates rhythm; stress/harm create within-session and between-session tension curves

***

## 7. Balance Mechanisms in Detail

### Position/Effect Negotiation

**How it works:**

1. Player declares action and intended goal
2. GM assesses fictional situation
3. GM announces Position and Effect
4. Player can:
   * Accept
   * Trade Position for Effect (worse risk, better reward)
   * Trade Effect for Position (safer, less impact)
   * Spend stress to Push (improve effect without worsening position)
   * Propose different approach (changes action used)
5. Roll happens

**Balance function:** Creates explicit risk/reward calculation with player agency

**Example from SRD:**

* Fighting gang alone: Desperate/Limited (high risk, low impact)
* Fighting gang from chokepoint: Risky/Limited (medium risk, low impact)
* Sniping gang unaware: Controlled/Great (low risk, high impact)

### Stress as Pressure Valve

**Multiple uses:**

1. **Push yourself:** Improve outcome without worsening position (2 stress)
2. **Resist consequence:** Roll to reduce/avoid harm (0-5 stress, random)
3. **Assist ally:** Give them +1d (1 stress)
4. **Flashback:** Retroactively establish preparation (0-2 stress)

**Balance function:** Players always have options to improve situation at cost. No "I have no moves" situations.

**Key insight:** Stress spending is player-initiated. GM doesn't force stress spending; players choose when stakes matter enough.

### Resistance Rolls

**Mechanic:**

* When consequence would occur, player can resist
* Roll dice equal to relevant attribute (usually 1-3 dice)
* Suffer 6 minus result in stress (0-5 stress)
* Consequence is reduced or avoided (GM choice based on tone)

**Balance function:**

* Catastrophic outcomes avoidable but expensive
* Creates tension: "Do I spend stress now or save it?"
* Random cost creates uncertainty (can't perfectly calculate)

**Example:** Stabbed for Level 3 harm → resist with Prowess → roll 5 → take 1 stress → harm reduced to Level 2

### Harm Escalation

**Mechanic:**

* 3 severity levels with limited slots (2/2/1 slots)
* When you'd take harm but slots full, escalates one level
* Level 4 (fatal) = death/catastrophic permanent consequence

**Balance function:**

* Can't accumulate infinite small wounds
* Eventually forces hard choices (resist and take stress, or accept escalating harm)
* Death is possible but requires multiple escalations (not instant)

**Example:** Already have 2 Level 1 harms → take another Level 1 → becomes Level 2 instead

### Flashbacks

**Mechanic:**

* During score, pause and roleplay past preparation scene
* Cost: 0 stress (simple), 1 stress (complex), 2 stress (elaborate)
* Changes current situation retroactively

**Balance function:**

* Rewards cleverness without requiring planning phase
* Stress cost prevents abuse
* Enables "heist movie" pacing (reveal plans through action)
* Reduces analysis paralysis

**Example:** "Wait, I spent stress last week to research this building's layout. I know about the secret passage!" (1 stress flashback)

### Clocks for Non-Binary Progress

**Mechanic:**

* Goals/dangers represented as segmented circles
* Fill segments based on Effect level achieved
* Multiple approaches can contribute to same clock

**Balance function:**

* Failure doesn't mean no progress (partial success still ticks clock)
* Success isn't binary (great effect ≠ instant success, just faster progress)
* Creates momentum even through mixed results
* Makes "difficulty" visible (4-clock vs. 8-clock shows complexity)

***

## 8. How Different Player Types Experience Balance

### Challenge-Focused Players

**Experience:**

* Satisfaction from Position/Effect negotiation mastery
* Learning optimal stress spending patterns
* Understanding when to push vs. when to accept consequences
* Mastering action selection for best position/effect combos

**Potential issues:**

* System isn't about optimization (no "best build")
* Success with consequences can feel like failure
* Can't min-max way to safety

**System accommodation:** Deep tactical choices in moment-to-moment play, even if long-term optimization limited

### Narrative-Focused Players

**Experience:**

* Trauma creates automatic character development
* Consequences emerge from fiction, not arbitrary mechanics
* Position/Effect grounds stakes in story
* Flashbacks enable cool character moments

**Potential issues:**

* Mechanical weight can feel heavy for narrative game
* Position/Effect negotiation requires engagement with mechanics
* Stress/harm tracking takes mental bandwidth

**System accommodation:** Mechanics serve story (trauma changes character, harm describes injuries narratively)

### Fellowship-Focused Players

**Experience:**

* Assist action creates mechanical teamwork
* Crew advancement shared goal
* Downtime provides character interaction
* Devil's bargains can be suggested by other players

**Potential issues:**

* Individual stress/harm management can feel isolating
* Spotlight distribution needs active GM management
* Not all playbooks equally social

**System accommodation:** Crew-level mechanics, explicit teamwork actions, shared consequences (heat, wanted level)

***

## 9. Common Balance Problems & Solutions

### Problem: Stress Death Spiral

**Issue:** Players take stress to resist consequences, run out of stress, then can't resist worse consequences, leading to trauma or death

**Design solution:**

* Downtime phase breaks scores, allows recovery
* Multiple stress recovery opportunities (vice, long-term project rewards)
* Trauma is character-changing, not character-ending (until 4th trauma)

**Remaining issues:** Some groups report stress accumulation faster than recovery, especially with frequent flashbacks

### Problem: Position/Effect Negotiation Slowdown

**Issue:** Stopping to discuss Position/Effect before every roll disrupts flow

**Design solution:**

* Default to Risky/Standard (reduces negotiation frequency)
* Framework becomes intuitive with practice
* GM can announce position/effect proactively for common situations

**Remaining issues:** Learning curve steep for groups used to simpler resolution

### Problem: Harm Can Feel Arbitrary

**Issue:** Level of harm assigned by GM can seem inconsistent or unclear

**Design solution:**

* Position explicitly sets harm level expectations before roll
* Examples in book provide guidance
* Resistance always available as player agency

**Remaining issues:** Still requires GM judgment; different tables have different tone preferences (gritty vs. cinematic)

### Problem: Flashback Cost Confusion

**Issue:** Unclear when flashback should cost 0, 1, or 2 stress

**Design solution:**

* Guidelines provided (simple/complex/elaborate)
* Cost based on how much it strains credibility, not success/failure

**Remaining issues:** Still requires judgment call; some groups house-rule to flat cost or unlimited flashbacks

***

## 10. LLM Integration Possibilities

### Where LLM Could Enhance

**Position/Effect Adjudication:**

* LLM could implement framework consistently
* Takes burden off GM for every roll
* Could track fictional factors (scale, quality, potency) automatically
* **Implementation:** LLM maintains situation model, applies Position/Effect framework rules

**Proposal:**

```
System prompt includes:
- Full Position/Effect framework rules
- Current fictional situation state
- Character capabilities and circumstances
When player declares action:
1. LLM assesses factors (scale, quality, potency, fictional positioning)
2. Determines Position and Effect
3. Explains reasoning
4. Offers trade-off options
5. Player confirms or negotiates
```

**Challenge:** Requires LLM to understand fiction consistently, not just mechanics

**Clock Management:**

* LLM could track multiple clocks (score progress, danger, faction clocks)
* Suggests appropriate clock ticks based on Effect level
* Reminds GM of clock consequences when filled
* **Implementation:** Structured state tracking with trigger conditions

**Consequence Generation:**

* LLM generates appropriate complications for partial successes
* Suggests Devil's Bargains relevant to situation
* Creates consequences matching Position level
* **Implementation:** Few-shot prompting with consequence examples at each Position

**Example Prompt Structure:**

```
Position: Desperate
Effect: Standard
Action: Prowl (stealth past guards)
Result: Partial success (4-5)

Generate a consequence that:
- Matches Desperate position (severe consequence)
- Relates to the fiction (guards, infiltration)
- Provides difficult choice or complication
- Doesn't simply negate success

Example consequences:
- You get past, but guard captain recognizes you from wanted poster (complication)
- You make it through, but your partner doesn't (separate failure)
- You succeed but leave evidence behind (future danger)
```

### Where LLM Might Struggle

**Tone Consistency:**

* Blades has specific noir/Victorian/supernatural aesthetic
* LLM might generate consequences that don't fit tone
* **Mitigation:** Heavy prompt engineering with tone examples, feedback loop for player/GM to accept/reject

**Trauma and Character Arc:**

* Long-term character development through trauma
* Requires remembering character's trauma choices and personality evolution
* **Challenge:** Context window limits across multiple sessions
* **Mitigation:** Structured character state tracking, trauma as explicit tags in prompt

**Negotiation vs. Dictation:**

* Position/Effect is negotiated, not dictated
* LLM might seem authoritative rather than collaborative
* **Challenge:** Social dynamic, not just mechanical
* **Mitigation:** Always present LLM suggestions as proposals, encourage player input

### What LLM Should NOT Do

**Replace Player Agency:**

* Players MUST choose whether to accept position, trade, push, or resist
* LLM should inform, not decide
* **Why:** Player choice is core to Blades' balance model

**Remove Stress/Harm Resource Management:**

* LLM shouldn't soften consequences automatically
* Must maintain scarcity and tough choices
* **Why:** Tension comes from limited resources and permanent consequences

**Eliminate GM Judgment:**

* Some calls require tone preferences (reduce vs. avoid on resistance)
* Group-specific calibration needed
* **Why:** Balance is about consistent adjudication, not removing human judgment entirely

***

## 11. Balance Lessons for LLM-Enhanced Games

### Lesson 1: Explicit Frameworks > Implicit Fairness

**Blades shows:** Position/Effect framework creates consistent adjudication without requiring mathematical balance
**For LLM design:** Encode explicit decision frameworks in system prompts, not vague "be fair" instructions

### Lesson 2: Player Agency Requires Transparency

**Blades shows:** Players make good choices when they know stakes before rolling
**For LLM design:** LLM should make consequences visible before player commits, allow negotiation

### Lesson 3: Two-Tier Resource System Manages Tension

**Blades shows:** Stress (renewable) and Harm (persistent) create different types of pressure
**For LLM design:** Short-term and long-term consequence resources both needed, LLM must respect both

### Lesson 4: Consequences That Stick Create Stakes

**Blades shows:** Trauma is permanent, harm is slow to heal, meaningful choices require non-reversibility
**For LLM design:** LLM must not provide easy outs for consequences, maintain scarcity

### Lesson 5: Framework Enables Adaptation

**Blades shows:** Position/Effect adapts to any situation while maintaining consistency
**For LLM design:** Good framework lets LLM handle novel situations without breaking balance

***

## 12. What Makes This Balance Approach Work

### Success Factors

**1. Framework Is Teachable:**

* Position/Effect can be learned and internalized
* Players develop intuition for what Position/Effect combo applies
* Not dependent on designer/GM secret knowledge

**2. Consequences Are Interesting:**

* Partial success (4-5) most common result
* Creates "success with complication" rather than binary pass/fail
* Complications drive story forward

**3. Player Agency Maintained:**

* Multiple ways to modify situation (push, assist, flashback, resist)
* Choice points before and after rolls
* Never truly stuck with no options

**4. Resources Create Meaningful Choices:**

* Spending stress now means less ability to resist later
* Taking harm now means longer recovery in downtime
* Trauma accumulation creates character retirement pressure
* Decisions matter because resources scarce and don't fully recover

**5. Fiction Integrated With Mechanics:**

* Position/Effect determined by fictional situation
* Harm described narratively, not just numbers
* Trauma manifests as personality changes
* Mechanics reinforce setting (criminals under pressure)

### Why It Could Fail

**High GM Cognitive Load:**

* Position/Effect judgment every roll
* Tracking multiple clocks
* Generating appropriate consequences
* Maintaining tone consistency
* Balancing spotlight across crew

**Learning Curve:**

* Position/Effect framework not intuitive initially
* Multiple resource systems to track
* Flashback timing unclear
* Devil's Bargain generation difficult

**Tone Calibration Required:**

* How harsh should consequences be?
* Reduce vs. avoid on resistance?
* How much harm for which Position?
* Requires group consensus

**Stress System Can Break:**

* If stress accumulates too fast, death spiral
* If recovery too easy, no tension
* Flashbacks can drain stress quickly
* Balance requires calibration per group

***

## 13. Comparison to Alternative Approaches

### vs. D\&D-Style Level-Appropriate Balance

**D\&D:** Challenges scaled to party level, CR system, HP as main resource\
**Blades:** Challenges based on fiction not power level, Position/Effect based on situation, Stress/Harm as dual resources

**Advantage of Blades:** Setting stays dangerous regardless of character advancement, consequences more varied than HP damage\
**Disadvantage of Blades:** No clear power curve, character advancement less satisfying for some players

### vs. Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA)

**PbtA:** 2d6+modifier, moves with specific triggers, partial success built-in\
**Blades:** Dice pool (variable), actions with flexible application, Position/Effect adds granularity

**Advantage of Blades:** More tactical depth (position/effect trade-offs, stress spending), explicit risk/reward transparency\
**Disadvantage of Blades:** More complex, higher cognitive load, less immediately accessible

### vs. Traditional GM Fiat

**Fiat:** GM decides consequences case-by-case based on intuition\
**Blades:** Framework guides GM decisions, Position/Effect creates consistency

**Advantage of Blades:** Players can predict consequences, adjudication feels fair and consistent\
**Disadvantage of Blades:** Less flexibility for GM to adjust on fly, requires learning framework

***

## 14. Extractable Design Principles

### Principle 1: Make Stakes Transparent Before Commitment

**Application:** Players should know risk before taking action. Explicit Position/Effect announcement before roll reduces "gotcha" moments and enables informed choice.

**How to implement:**

* Announce consequence severity before roll
* Specify what success/failure mean mechanically
* Allow player to change approach based on stakes
* Create vocabulary for risk levels

### Principle 2: Separate Renewable and Permanent Consequences

**Application:** Two-tier resource system (stress/harm) creates different pressure types. Short-term resources enable tactical spending; long-term resources create campaign stakes.

**How to implement:**

* Buffer resource: recovers quickly, spend for immediate advantage
* Consequence resource: recovers slowly or not at all, creates lasting impact
* Make recovery patterns explicit and predictable
* Ensure both resources actually scarce

### Principle 3: Framework Beats Fiat for Consistency

**Application:** Explicit adjudication framework creates predictable, fair rulings without eliminating judgment. Better than either pure math (too rigid) or pure GM discretion (inconsistent).

**How to implement:**

* Define decision factors (Position/Effect uses scale, quality, potency)
* Create vocabulary for outcomes
* Make framework public (in rules, not GM-only)
* Show example applications
* Allow framework to be learned and mastered

### Principle 4: Partial Success Should Be Common

**Application:** Binary pass/fail creates stalemates and frustration. Partial success (success with complication) maintains momentum while creating interesting situations.

**How to implement:**

* Make partial success most probable outcome (in Blades: \~44% on 2d6)
* Define what partial success means (not just "half effect")
* Complications should complicate, not negate success
* Train GM to generate interesting complications

### Principle 5: Player Agency Requires Multiple Levers

**Application:** Players need multiple ways to influence outcomes or they feel helpless. Stress spending, assistance, flashbacks, resistance, and position/effect trade-offs all provide agency.

**How to implement:**

* Before roll: Let players modify approach, trade position for effect, spend resources to improve chances
* After roll: Let players spend resources to reduce consequences
* Retroactively: Let players reframe situation (flashbacks)
* Make all options costly but available

***

## 15. Open Questions & Areas for Further Research

### Question 1: Optimal Stress/Harm Recovery Rate

**Issue:** Different groups report wildly different experiences with stress accumulation\
**Variables:** Flashback frequency, resistance usage, GM consequence harshness, session length\
**Research needed:** What's the "correct" balance, or is variability intentional?

### Question 2: Position/Effect Calibration Across GMs

**Issue:** Different GMs assign Position/Effect differently for same situation\
**Question:** Is this variance acceptable (table preference) or problematic (inconsistency)?\
**Research needed:** Study how experienced vs. new GMs use framework, whether consensus emerges with experience

### Question 3: LLM Implementation of Position/Effect

**Issue:** Can LLM consistently apply framework across varied situations?\
**Challenge:** Requires understanding fiction, not just mechanics\
**Research needed:** Prototype LLM Position/Effect adjudicator, test against human GM decisions, measure consistency and player satisfaction

### Question 4: Scaling Without Power Creep

**Issue:** Blades characters advance (better actions, special abilities) but setting stays dangerous\
**Question:** Does this create satisfying progression or frustrating treadmill?\
**Research needed:** Long-term campaign analysis, compare player satisfaction at Tier 0 vs. Tier 3

### Question 5: Framework Teachability

**Issue:** Position/Effect has learning curve; how steep and how to reduce?\
**Question:** What teaching methods work best? Can tooling help?\
**Research needed:** Compare learning outcomes with different teaching approaches, test digital GM aids

***

## 16. Key Takeaways for "From Principles to Numbers"

### For Game Designers

**1. Frameworks create consistency without rigidity:**
Blades shows that explicit adjudication principles can replace mathematical balance while maintaining fairness. Position/Effect creates shared language and expectations.

**2. Transparency enables agency:**
When players know stakes before committing, they can make meaningful choices. Hidden difficulty checks and surprise consequences undermine player agency.

**3. Resource scarcity creates tension:**
Two-tier resource system (stress/harm) works because both are genuinely scarce. Buffer resources must actually deplete; consequence resources must actually persist.

**4. Consequences must stick:**
Trauma doesn't heal, harm heals slowly. Meaningful choices require consequences you can't easily undo. Resistance provides agency without removing consequences entirely.

**5. Partial success is your friend:**
Most interesting outcomes are "yes, but..." not "yes" or "no". Design probability distributions to make partial success common.

### For LLM Integration

**1. Frameworks are LLM-implementable:**
Position/Effect could be encoded in system prompts and consistently applied. Framework's explicitness makes it programmable.

**2. LLM needs constraints:**
Unconstrained LLM will drift toward "yes and" (see AI Dungeon failure). Position/Effect framework provides needed boundaries.

**3. Transparency still critical:**
LLM should announce Position/Effect before player commits, explain reasoning, allow negotiation. Don't hide stakes.

**4. Resource tracking essential:**
LLM must respect stress/harm scarcity, not magically provide outs. Consequence permanence must be maintained.

**5. Human judgment still valuable:**
Tone calibration (how harsh?), group preference (reduce vs. avoid?), social dynamics (when to push player?) - these require human GM.

### For Testing Framework

**When we test balance framework on scenario, we should measure:**

* How clearly could Position/Effect be determined? (transparency)
* Did stress/harm create meaningful pressure? (resource scarcity)
* Were consequences reversible or sticky? (consequence persistence)
* Could players make informed risk/reward choices? (agency)
* Did framework handle unusual situations? (adaptability)
