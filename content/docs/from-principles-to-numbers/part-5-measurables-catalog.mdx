# Part 5: Measurables Catalog

This is your reference section. When you know your paradigm and aesthetic, come here to identify which measurables to optimize.

Each measurable includes:

* **Definition:** What this measures
* **Scale:** How to quantify it
* **Paradigm behavior:** How each paradigm typically handles this
* **Primary aesthetics:** Which aesthetics care most
* **Common targets:** Typical values for different contexts

This isn't exhaustive—you might identify additional measurables for your specific design. But these cover the vast majority of balance considerations.

***

## Component 1: Temporal Dynamics

How experience unfolds over time.

**Note on Pacing:** Many temporal dynamics measurables relate to **pacing**—the rhythm and flow of experience. Pacing is not a single mechanism but an emergent property of how your systems interact. When do resources deplete? How often do decisions occur? When do consequences arrive? How do tension and release alternate? These questions determine your game's temporal feel.

### Understanding Pacing Patterns

Before diving into individual measurables, understand that different designs create different pacing patterns:

**Attrition Pacing:**

* Pressure builds gradually across multiple encounters
* Resources deplete slowly, recovery limited
* Example: Old-school D\&D (daily spells, slow healing), HoMM3 (permanent losses)
* Best for: Challenge (strategic), Tension aesthetics
* Feel: "Being ground down, every decision matters"

**Episodic Pacing:**

* Each encounter/scene self-contained, resources reset
* Fresh start each time
* Example: Modern D\&D short rests, Fate scenes, most video game levels
* Best for: Challenge (tactical), Narrative (scene-based), Fellowship
* Feel: "Each scene is new opportunity, failure doesn't compound"

**Wave Pacing:**

* Alternating intensity: build-up → climax → recovery → repeat
* Multiple cycles per session
* Example: Blades in the Dark scores, L4D2 AI Director cycles
* Best for: Most aesthetics, engagement management
* Feel: "Natural rhythm, tension rises and falls"

**Continuous Pacing:**

* Steady state without clear breaks
* Real-time pressure or seamless flow
* Example: Real-time strategy, action games, some narrative games
* Best for: Challenge (execution), Immersion, Flow state
* Feel: "In the zone" or "Can't put this down"

**Punctuated Pacing:**

* Long calm periods interrupted by sudden intense moments
* Example: Horror games, open-world exploration
* Best for: Discovery, Tension (anticipation), Narrative surprise
* Feel: "Calm exploration then sudden terror"

**Your paradigm influences pacing:**

* Framework often creates Wave pacing (stake negotiation → resolution → consequence cycles)
* Consistency often creates Episodic or Continuous (encounter-based or seamless execution)
* Adaptive explicitly manages Wave pacing (build/peak/relax cycles)

**The measurables below help you target and measure your intended pacing pattern.**

### 1.1 Time-to-Kill (TTK)

**Definition:** How long it takes to defeat an opponent or overcome a challenge.

**Measurement scale:**

* Seconds/minutes for real-time combat
* Number of turns/rounds for turn-based
* Number of player actions required

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** TTK varies based on Position/Effect negotiation (wide range acceptable)
* **Consistency:** TTK should be predictable within ±20% (enables planning)
* **Adaptive:** TTK adjusted based on player performance (struggling → faster, skilled → longer)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: TTK must feel earned (not too fast, not too slow)
* Tension: Short TTK creates urgency and danger
* Fellowship: Coordinated TTK prevents one player dominating

**Common targets:**

* Trash enemies: 5-15 seconds (1-3 player actions)
* Elite enemies: 30-60 seconds (5-10 player actions)
* Mini-bosses: 2-5 minutes (15-30 player actions)
* Major bosses: 5-10 minutes (40-80 player actions)
* Raid bosses: 10-20 minutes (multi-phase, 100+ actions)

**Red flags:**

* Below 3 seconds: Might feel trivial, no time for tactics
* Above 15 minutes: Risk tedium unless mechanically interesting throughout
* High variance (±50%+): Feels random, prevents planning

### 1.2 Session Duration

**Definition:** How long a typical play session lasts.

**Measurement scale:**

* Minutes for short sessions
* Hours for medium/long sessions
* Can measure actual vs. intended duration

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Session can end at any dramatic moment (flexible)
* **Consistency:** Session ends at checkpoints/victories (structured)
* **Adaptive:** System can compress/extend to hit target duration

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Submission: Short sessions (\<30 min) for casual play
* Challenge: Medium sessions (1-3 hours) for focused mastery
* Narrative: Flexible (end at narrative beats, 2-4 hours typical)
* Discovery: Long sessions (3-6 hours) to explore thoroughly

**Common targets:**

* Mobile/casual: 5-15 minutes
* Single sitting: 30-90 minutes
* Campaign session: 2-4 hours
* Marathon session: 4-8+ hours (supported but not required)

**Red flags:**

* Forced sessions over 4 hours without good stopping points
* No session shorter than 1 hour (excludes casual players)
* Can't save/checkpoint within first 30 minutes

### 1.3 Decision Frequency

**Definition:** How often players make meaningful choices.

**Measurement scale:**

* Decisions per minute (real-time)
* Decisions per turn (turn-based)
* Time between significant choices

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Moderate (time for stake negotiation, \~1 decision per 5-15 min)
* **Consistency:** High in combat (action every turn), low in planning (thoughtful preparation)
* **Adaptive:** Varies (system can increase/decrease decision pressure)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: High frequency tests skill under pressure
* Narrative: Moderate frequency allows contemplation of choices
* Tension: High frequency creates time pressure
* Submission: Low frequency reduces cognitive load

**Common targets:**

* Real-time action: 10-30 decisions per minute (high intensity)
* Real-time tactics: 2-5 decisions per minute (thoughtful)
* Turn-based tactics: 1 decision per 10-30 seconds
* Narrative choices: 1 major decision per 10-15 minutes

**Red flags:**

* More than 60 decisions/minute (overwhelming, impossible to deliberate)
* Fewer than 1 decision per 5 minutes in "active" play (boring, watching not playing)
* Inconsistent (sometimes 20/min, sometimes 1/hour without clear mode shift)

### 1.4 Tension Gradient

**Definition:** How intensity/pressure varies over time.

**Measurement scale:**

* Flat: Constant intensity
* Cyclical: Build-up → peak → relief → repeat
* Escalating: Steadily increasing intensity
* Declining: Steadily decreasing intensity

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Naturally cyclical (stakes negotiation creates peaks)
* **Consistency:** Manually designed (bonfire placement, enemy density)
* **Adaptive:** Actively managed (AI Director-style pacing)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Tension: Cyclical with high peaks (adrenaline spikes)
* Challenge: Escalating or consistent high (sustained difficulty)
* Narrative: Cyclical matching story beats (drama → resolution)
* Submission: Flat or declining (relaxation, no stress)

**Common targets:**

* Action games: 2-3 minute cycles (60-90s build, 15-30s peak, 30-45s relax)
* Horror: Long builds (5-10 min), short peaks (15-30s), medium relax (2-3 min)
* Puzzle: Flat intensity (consistent engagement)
* Campaign narrative: Session-long arcs (build over 2-3 hours, climax, resolution)

**Red flags:**

* No relief phases in high-tension game (exhausting)
* No peaks in tension-focused game (boring)
* Random intensity (jarring, no rhythm)

### 1.5 Cycle Length

**Definition:** Duration of one complete pacing cycle (build → resolution → recovery).

**Measurement scale:**

* Micro-cycles: \<1 minute (individual actions)
* Short cycles: 1-5 minutes (combat rounds, quick scenes)
* Medium cycles: 5-15 minutes (encounters, scene complexes)
* Long cycles: 15-60 minutes (quest arcs, mission structures)
* Macro-cycles: 60+ minutes (session arcs, campaign chapters)

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Medium cycles (negotiate → roll → consequence → recover)
* **Consistency:** Short to Medium (encounter → victory/defeat → regroup)
* **Adaptive:** Designed explicitly (L4D2: 2-3 minute build/peak/relax cycles)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge (tactical): Short to Medium (clear feedback loops)
* Challenge (strategic): Long to Macro (decisions compound)
* Narrative: Medium to Long (scene and act structure)
* Fellowship: Medium (space for discussion between cycles)
* Tension: Variable (builds anticipation)

**Common targets:**

* Real-time action: Micro (constant action-reaction)
* Turn-based combat: Short (3-5 minute encounters)
* Investigation/scenes: Medium (10-15 minute scenes)
* Story arcs: Long (30-60 minute sequences)
* Session structure: Macro (2-4 hour session arc)

**Pacing pattern relationships:**

* Attrition: Long cycles or no distinct cycles (pressure continuous)
* Episodic: Short to Medium cycles (clear resolution each time)
* Wave: Medium cycles repeated (multiple peaks per session)
* Continuous: Micro cycles or none (seamless flow)
* Punctuated: Long cycles with sudden short spikes

**Red flags:**

* Cycles too short for meaningful decisions (rushed)
* Cycles too long without sub-cycles (monotonous)
* No cycles at all when aesthetic needs rhythm (flat)
* Cycle length mismatched to session duration (only 1-2 cycles in 4-hour session)

* Action games: Every 5-10 minutes (between encounters)
* Narrative games: Every 10-20 minutes (between scenes)
* Fellowship games: Every 5-15 minutes (discussion breaks)
* Relaxed games: Constant low pressure

**Relationship to Wave Pacing:**

* Wave pacing requires regular recovery (the "relax" phase)
* Recovery frequency determines wave frequency
* Too frequent recovery → no tension builds
* Too rare recovery → exhaustion

**Red flags:**

* Never in multi-hour session (player exhaustion)
* Constant when Tension aesthetic intended (no stakes)
* Mismatched to Cycle Length (recovery doesn't align with cycles)

### 1.7 Recovery Speed

**Definition:** How quickly players can restore lost resources (HP, ammo, etc.).

**Measurement scale:**

* Instant: Immediate full recovery
* Fast: Recovers in seconds/minutes
* Slow: Recovers in 10+ minutes or between sessions
* Permanent: Never recovers (permadeath, permanent loss)

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Varies by consequence type (stress fast, harm slow, trauma permanent)
* **Consistency:** Typically slow (raises stakes for pattern learning)
* **Adaptive:** Varies (system grants fast recovery to struggling players)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: Slow recovery (resource management matters)
* Tension: Slow recovery (danger persists)
* Submission: Fast recovery (minimize frustration)
* Narrative: Variable (stress fast, trauma slow for story purposes)

**Common targets:**

* HP in Challenge game: Slow (1-2 HP per minute out of combat)

**Measurement scale:**

* **None:** No progression (pure skill-based)
* **Skill:** Player gets better (Dark Souls pattern learning)
* **Character:** Stats/abilities improve
* **Meta:** Account-wide unlocks
* **Narrative:** Story advances
* **Collection:** Acquire items/achievements

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Skill + Narrative (learn system + story progresses)
* **Consistency:** Skill primary (pattern mastery)
* **Adaptive:** Character + Meta (power compensates for skill gaps)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: Skill (player improvement is achievement)
* Mastery: Skill (deep system understanding)
* Narrative: Narrative (story is progress)
* Progression: Character + Meta (becoming powerful)
* Collection: Collection (completionism)

**Common targets:**

* Pure skill: Fighting games, challenge platformers
* Character: Traditional RPGs (levels, stats)
* Meta: Roguelikes (permanent unlocks across runs)
* Narrative: Story games (unlock story beats)
* Hybrid: Most modern games (multiple types)

**Red flags:**

* Challenge aesthetic with only Character progression (power not skill)
* Narrative aesthetic with no Narrative progression (story stagnant)
* Too many types simultaneously (overwhelming)

### 6.2 Power Curve

**Definition:** How does power change over time?

**Measurement scale:**

* **Flat:** No power increase
* **Linear:** Constant growth rate
* **Exponential:** Accelerating growth
* **S-curve:** Fast early, then flattens
* **Stepped:** Discrete jumps (level-ups)

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Flat to Linear (skill improvement, not stat scaling)
* **Consistency:** Flat (pure skill-based) to Stepped (gear upgrades)
* **Adaptive:** Linear to S-curve (system compensates at top end)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: Flat (pure skill testing)
* Progression: Exponential to S-curve (feeling of growth)
* Tension: Flat to Linear (consistency in stakes)
* Submission: Linear (steady comfortable growth)

**Common targets:**

* Skill-based: Flat (player skill only variable)
* RPG early: Linear (levels 1-10)
* RPG mid: Exponential (levels 10-20, accelerating)
* RPG late: S-curve (flattens at cap)

**Red flags:**

* Exponential without cap (breaks balance at high level)
* Flat in Progression-focused game (no advancement feeling)
* Too steep early (trivializes content too fast)

### 6.3 Mastery Curve

**Definition:** How does player capability improve with practice?

**Measurement scale:**

* **None:** No improvement possible (pure randomness)
* **Slow:** Small improvements over long practice
* **Moderate:** Noticeable improvement per session
* **Fast:** Rapid improvement within hours
* **Perfect:** Can master completely

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Moderate (learn system, doesn't cap)
* **Consistency:** Fast to Perfect (pattern learning enables mastery)
* **Adaptive:** Slow (system adjusts, prevents ceiling)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: Fast to Perfect (mastery is goal)
* Mastery: Perfect (complete understanding possible)
* Tension: Moderate (some improvement, always challenging)
* Submission: None to Slow (not focused on mastery)

**Common targets:**

* Fighting games: Perfect (frame-perfect execution possible)
* Dark Souls: Fast (bosses that took 20 attempts now take 1-2)
* L4D2: Moderate (better coordination over time)
* Casual games: Slow to None (consistent difficulty)

**Red flags:**

* Challenge aesthetic with None/Slow curve (frustration)
* Mastery aesthetic without Perfect capability (ceiling too low)
* Adaptive canceling out improvement (feels patronizing)

### 6.4 Unlock Pacing

**Definition:** How quickly do new options become available?

**Measurement scale:**

* Unlocks per hour
* Percentage of total content per session
* Time to 100% unlock

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** N/A (all options available from start typically)
* **Consistency:** Slow (focus on mastery before new complexity)
* **Adaptive:** Moderate to Fast (maintain variety)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Discovery: Fast (2-5 unlocks per hour)
* Progression: Moderate (1-2 per hour)
* Challenge: Slow (master before adding complexity)
* Mastery: Slow (depth before breadth)

**Common targets:**

* Early game: Fast (unlock core systems in first hour)
* Mid game: Moderate (1-2 unlocks per hour)
* Late game: Slow (most content available, occasional surprise)
* Total time to 100%: 20-100 hours depending on game scope

**Red flags:**

* Discovery game unlocking 100% in first 10 hours
* Challenge game adding complexity faster than can master
* No unlocks after early game (nothing new to discover)

## Component 7: Emotional Dynamics

What feelings are evoked.

### 7.1 Emotional Stakes

**Definition:** How much do players care about outcomes personally?

**Measurement scale:**

* **None:** Emotionally uninvested
* **Low:** Mild preference for winning
* **Moderate:** Care about outcomes
* **High:** Deeply invested in results
* **Extreme:** Real emotional impact

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** High (narrative investment)
* **Consistency:** Moderate to High (achievement investment)
* **Adaptive:** Varies (system can manage intensity)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Narrative: High to Extreme (story matters personally)
* Challenge: Moderate to High (achievement matters)
* Fellowship: Moderate (team bonding)
* Submission: None to Low (relaxation)

**Common targets:**

* Story-driven: High (care about characters, outcomes)
* Challenge-driven: Moderate (care about overcoming)
* Casual: Low (light investment)
* Competitive: High to Extreme (ego involvement)

**Red flags:**

* Narrative game with Low stakes (story doesn't land)
* Submission game with High stakes (anxiety not relaxation)
* Extreme stakes without support systems (toxic)

### 7.2 Frustration Tolerance

**Definition:** How much frustration is acceptable?

**Measurement scale:**

* **None:** Zero frustration acceptable
* **Low:** Minor frustration okay
* **Moderate:** Some frustration expected
* **High:** Significant frustration tolerated
* **Extreme:** Designed to frustrate

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Low to Moderate (GM manages)
* **Consistency:** High (death teaches)
* **Adaptive:** Low to Moderate (system helps before extreme frustration)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: High (frustration → mastery → satisfaction)
* Submission: None (relaxation)
* Fellowship: Low to Moderate (team frustration spreads)
* Narrative: Low (don't want frustration blocking story)

**Common targets:**

* Challenge games: High (Dark Souls: die 20+ times acceptable)
* Narrative: Low (stuck = can't see story = bad)
* Casual: None to Low (frustration = quit)
* Puzzle: Moderate (want challenge without helplessness)

**Red flags:**

* Submission aesthetic with High frustration (contradicts goal)
* High frustration without clear path forward (helpless not challenged)
* Extreme frustration (almost always toxic)

### 7.3 Achievement Satisfaction

**Definition:** How rewarding does success feel?

**Measurement scale:**

* **None:** No satisfaction (random or trivial)
* **Low:** Mild satisfaction
* **Moderate:** Noticeable satisfaction
* **High:** Significant sense of achievement
* **Extreme:** Major life accomplishment feeling

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Moderate to High (story victories feel earned)
* **Consistency:** High to Extreme (mastery satisfaction deep)
* **Adaptive:** Low to Moderate (if help obvious, satisfaction reduced)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: High to Extreme (achievement is core goal)
* Mastery: Extreme (perfection satisfaction)
* Narrative: Moderate (story resolution satisfaction)
* Submission: None to Low (not focused on achievement)

**Common targets:**

* Challenge games: High (beat Dark Souls boss)
* Competitive wins: High (beat other players)
* Story resolution: Moderate (completed narrative)
* Casual victories: Low (pleasant not profound)

**Red flags:**

* Challenge aesthetic with Low satisfaction (hollow victories)
* High satisfaction from trivial wins (participation trophy feeling)
* Adaptive help so obvious it reduces satisfaction

### 7.4 Flow State Frequency

**Definition**: How often players achieve flow state during play sessions.

**Framework Reference**: Chapter 1, Section 4 defines flow state as optimal challenge-skill balance and identifies aesthetic-specific flow profiles.

**Aesthetic-Specific Targets**:

* **Challenge aesthetic**: Frequent flow at edge of ability
  * Target: 60-80% of combat encounters in flow zone
  * Measurement: Player self-report + difficulty curve analysis

* **Fellowship aesthetic**: Flow through social engagement, not mechanical challenge
  * Target: Low mechanical load throughout (allows conversation during play)
  * Measurement: Can players talk while playing?

* **Submission aesthetic**: Gentle, predictable flow (meditation-like state)
  * Target: Consistent, uninterrupted flow for extended periods (30+ minutes)
  * Measurement: Lack of disruption, smooth progression

* **Mastery aesthetic**: Flow emerges as load decreases with practice
  * Target: Flow increases as skill increases (inverted beginner curve)
  * Measurement: Track flow across repeated play sessions

**Key Principle**: Flow isn't universal. Design loops for your aesthetic's flow profile, not "maximum flow" generically.

**Paradigm behavior:**

* **Framework:** Moderate (negotiation breaks flow, resolution can create it)
* **Consistency:** Frequent to Constant (skill-challenge balance enables flow)
* **Adaptive:** Frequent (system maintains flow channel)

**Primary aesthetics:**

* Challenge: Frequent (flow is goal state)
* Mastery: Frequent (deep engagement)
* Tension: Moderate (too much tension breaks flow)
* Submission: Frequent (relaxed engagement)

**Common targets:**

* Action games: Frequent (good challenge-skill balance)
* Puzzle games: Moderate to Frequent
* Narrative games: Moderate (story moments create flow)
* Badly balanced: Never (too hard or too easy)

**Red flags:**

* Challenge game with Never/Rare flow (wrong difficulty)
* Too many interruptions (breaks flow state)
* Flow only achievable at extreme skill (excludes most players)

### Paradigm → Required Measurables

**Framework paradigm requires:**

* Risk Visibility (HIGH) - stakes must be transparent
* Agency Scope (TACTICAL+) - choices must shape outcomes
* Information Transparency (PARTIAL+) - enough to make informed decisions
* Consequence Severity (MODERATE+) - stakes must matter

**Consistency paradigm requires:**

* Pattern Consistency (HIGH) - predictable outcomes
* Time-to-Kill Consistency (within ±20%) - plannable
* Mastery Curve (EXISTS) - improvement through practice
* Recovery Speed (SLOW) - stakes persist

**Adaptive paradigm requires:**

* Comeback Possibility (MODERATE+) - must be recoverable
* Tension Gradient (MANAGED) - system controls intensity
* Skill Gap Tolerance (HIGH) - accommodate variance
* Subtlety (NOT TOO OBVIOUS) - adaptation shouldn't feel manipulative

### How to Use This Catalog

**Step 1:** Identify your primary aesthetic (from earlier chapters)

**Step 2:** Find that aesthetic's priority measurables (quick reference above)

**Step 3:** Check your paradigm's required measurables (add to list)

**Step 4:** Look up each measurable in catalog for:

* Definition (what it means)
* Common targets (starting point values)
* Red flags (what to avoid)

**Step 5:** Use these measurables to guide your parameter setting (Part 6)

**Example workflow:**

* Aesthetic: Challenge
* Paradigm: Consistency
* Priority measurables: Consequence Severity (HIGH), Pattern Consistency (HIGH), Mastery Curve (steep), Recovery Speed (SLOW), Time-to-Kill Consistency (±20%)
* Look up each → get target values → use in Part 6 calculations

**Part 6 will show you how to turn measurable targets into actual numbers.**
