# Game Design Scenarios: Real Problems, Real Solutions

## Purpose of This Document

This document contains 6 realistic scenarios for game design, particularly considering LLM-enabled systems. Each scenario represents a real request from real people (or composite of common requests), not abstract design exercises.

**These scenarios serve as:**

1. **Design criteria** - If a system can't handle these, it's not meeting real needs
2. **Test cases** - Ways to validate that designs actually work
3. **Thought exercises** - Concrete problems to solve, not abstract possibilities

**Reality check:** Each scenario should pass the test: "Could I recruit players for this?" If you can't pitch it in one sentence and get interest, it's not real enough.

## SCENARIO 1: Busy Adults Want Consistent Campaign

### WHO ASKS FOR THIS

**Role:** Three professionals in their 30s-40s who were friends in college

**Exact Request:**
"We want to play D\&D like we did in college, but we have jobs and kids now. We can only meet once a month for 2 hours. Last time we tried, we spent half the session remembering what we were doing and looking up rules. Can you run something that actually works with our schedule?"

**Real Motivation:**

* Nostalgia and friendship maintenance
* Creative outlet and escape from work stress
* Want the campaign experience (not just one-shots)
* Limited time is non-negotiable

### DESIGN FREEDOM

* **Fixed constraints:**
  * 2 hours per session, once per month (time is non-negotiable)
  * 3 players with limited availability
  * Must feel complete each session (can't have 6-week cliffhangers)

* **Negotiable constraints:**
  * Genre/setting (fantasy preferred but flexible)
  * System complexity (willing to learn new system if it solves the problem)
  * Campaign vs episodic (want long-term story but each session must satisfy)

* **Open questions:**
  * What system best handles monthly gaps?
  * How to pace 2-hour sessions to feel complete?
  * How to maintain continuity across long gaps?

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Time:** 2 hours per session, once per month (sometimes 6+ weeks between sessions if someone cancels)
* **Players:** 3 people, played D\&D 15 years ago, rusty on current edition rules
* **Setting:** Fantasy preferred but flexible if another genre works better for time constraints
* **Tone:** Fun and collaborative, not grimdark or competitive. Want to feel like heroes.

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**What Players Experience:**

* Each session feels complete (accomplished something) even if part of larger story
* Can remember what happened last session without 30-minute recap
* Rules don't get in the way of fun
* Feel like their characters matter and are growing

**Observable Success:**

* Players schedule next session enthusiastically
* Less than 10 minutes needed to get from "hello" to actively playing
* Players reference events from multiple sessions ago (world feels persistent)
* No one pulls out phone during play due to boredom/confusion

### FAILURE MODES

* "Wait, what were we doing again?" every session start
* 30+ minutes spent on rules lookups in 2-hour session
* Cliffhanger endings where resolution is 4-6 weeks away
* Players forget their character's abilities/personality
* Someone stops showing up because it's not worth the time

### CURRENT SOLUTIONS & GAPS

**What People Do Now:**

* Play D\&D anyway, accept long recaps and forgotten threads
* Switch to simpler systems (still doesn't solve memory problem)
* Play only one-shots (no campaign satisfaction)
* Take extensive notes (requires homework between sessions)
* Record sessions (no one has time to listen)

**Why Insufficient:**

* Time problem isn't solved by simpler rules
* Memory problem requires active maintenance
* One-shots feel shallow, don't satisfy campaign desire
* Note-taking is homework (defeats "limited time" requirement)

### IDEAL VS PRACTICAL (Two-Stage Design)

**Stage 1: Optimal System (Questioning D\&D)**

**If we ignore "we want D\&D" and ask "what system best serves this need?":**

**The Core Problem:**

* Monthly 2-hour sessions with memory gaps
* Need episodic completeness + long-term continuity
* Quick start (no 30-min recap)

**D\&D's Weaknesses for This:**

* Combat takes forever (one fight can be entire session)
* Complex rules require reference (wastes precious time)
* Assumes weekly play (pacing doesn't work for monthly)
* Character advancement assumes frequent play
* No built-in recap or continuity tools

**Better System Candidates:**

**Option A: Blades in the Dark**

* Sessions naturally structured as "scores" (complete heists)
* Downtime actions between sessions (cover the monthly gap narratively)
* Fast-paced (2 hours is plenty for a score)
* Consequences carry forward (stress, heat, trauma)
* Character advancement through play, not XP grinding
* **Why better:** Built for episodic-but-connected play

**Option B: Powered by the Apocalypse (Dungeon World, The Sprawl)**

* Faster combat than D\&D (narrative-first, not tactical)
* Built-in momentum (failures move story forward, not stall)
* Session structure naturally episodic
* Character advancement tied to bonds/beliefs (easier to remember)
* **Why better:** "Play to find out what happens" suits infrequent play

**Option C: Fate Accelerated**

* Extremely rules-light (learn in 10 minutes)
* Aspects serve as built-in character/story memory
* Flexible pacing (can do complete story in 2 hours)
* Players contribute to worldbuilding (reduces GM prep)
* **Why better:** Minimal rules overhead, maximum story time

**Optimal Choice Analysis:**
For "busy adults, monthly, 2-hour sessions" → Blades in the Dark or Fate Accelerated probably serve better than D\&D 5e. Trade tactical combat complexity for narrative efficiency and episodic structure.

**Stage 2: If They Insist on D\&D (Practical Adaptation)**

**Given that players say "but we invested in D\&D characters and we like it":**

**What LLM Enables for D\&D Adaptation:**

* **Perfect session memory:** Complete recap in 5 minutes (what happened, what NPCs know, what's unresolved)
* **Adaptive pacing:** LLM structures each session as complete mini-arc while advancing long-term plot
* **Rules assistance:** Handle lookups instantly without breaking flow
* **Character continuity:** Remember each PC's personality, goals, relationships from months ago
* **Smart encounter design:** Create appropriately-sized encounters that fit exactly 2 hours

**Specific Adaptations Needed:**

1. **Session Structure:** LLM ensures each session has: clear objective at start, challenge/complication in middle, resolution by end (even if larger plot continues)
2. **Recap System:** Not boring summary - interactive questions: "What was your character doing? What did you learn about the villain? What decision did you make?"
3. **Encounter Scaling:** Dynamically adjust encounter complexity based on remaining time (don't start big fight with 20 minutes left)
4. **Character Investment:** LLM remembers what each player cares about, ensures everyone gets spotlight
5. **Rule Streamlining:** Auto-handle bookkeeping (encumbrance, rations, etc), only surface interesting rules decisions

**Tradeoffs by Keeping D\&D:**
**What You Keep:**

* Familiar system (no learning curve)
* Tactical combat they enjoy
* Invested characters and relationships
* "D\&D feel"

**What You Lose:**

* Combat will still dominate time (system's core design)
* Pacing will always be retrofitted, not native
* Rules overhead can't be fully eliminated
* System doesn't naturally support monthly episodic play

**Honest Assessment:**
D\&D can be made to work with LLM assistance, but you're fighting against the system's design. A system built for episodic play would serve this group better. But if they value their investment in D\&D, that's a legitimate choice - just acknowledge the tradeoffs.

### DESIGN CHALLENGES

**Technical:**

* Session pacing: guarantee complete arc in exactly 2 hours
* Recap system: engaging summary, not boring reading
* Long-term plot tracking: meaningful progress despite monthly gaps
* Character development: advancement feels satisfying with limited playtime

**Social:**

* Three players: everyone needs spotlight time (can't have "your character does nothing this session")
* Missing player problem: what if only 2 of 3 show up?
* Investment: keep players caring about world across multi-week gaps

**Ethical:**

* Time respect: never go over 2 hours without player consent
* Not exploitative: don't create artificial cliffhangers to force attendance

### VALIDATION

**How to Test:**

* Run 3-session arc with 4-week gaps between sessions
* Track recap time (should be \<10 minutes)
* Survey: "Did you feel this session accomplished something?" (target: 100% yes)
* Survey: "Could you remember the major plot points from last session?" (target: 80%+ yes)
* Observation: Did players reference past events naturally in conversation?

**Who to Test With:**

* Actual busy adults (not students)
* Must have real scheduling constraints
* Mix of experienced and rusty players

## SCENARIO 2: Mystery Fans Want Complex Investigation

### WHO ASKS FOR THIS

**Role:** Group of 3-5 friends who love mystery media (Knives Out, Only Murders in the Building, Agatha Christie)

**Exact Request:**
"We want to play a murder mystery where we actually investigate and figure it out. Not just roll Investigation checks and get told the answer. Everyone should have secrets, and we need to figure out who's lying about what. Some lies might not even be about the murder - just people hiding their own stuff."

**Real Motivation:**

* Love puzzle-solving and deduction
* Want "aha!" moments when pieces click
* Enjoy interrogation/social deduction
* Want fair-play mystery (clues exist, no gotchas)

### DESIGN FREEDOM

* **Fixed constraints:**
  * Must be fair-play mystery (solvable from clues given)
  * Complex deception (everyone has secrets, not just killer)
  * Investigation-focused (not combat)

* **Negotiable constraints:**
  * Setting/genre (flexible - could be mansion, space station, historical, etc.)
  * System (open to learning new system if it supports mystery better)
  * Length (one-shot vs short campaign)

* **Open questions:**
  * What setting best supports complex social mystery?
  * What system handles investigation + deception well?
  * How to make secrets interesting beyond just "whodunit"?

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Time:** One-shot (4-6 hours) or short campaign (3-5 sessions)
* **Players:** 3-5 people, enjoy mysteries and social interaction
* **Setting:** Flexible (classic mansion, small town, space station, historical)
* **Tone:** Mystery/suspense, can be cozy or noir depending on group preference

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**What Players Experience:**

* Genuine "aha!" moment when pieces connect
* Feel like they solved it (not told the solution)
* Satisfying confrontation of culprit with evidence
* Red herrings are interesting (not just padding)

**Observable Success:**

* Players actively theorize and debate solutions during play
* Players take notes voluntarily (engaged in puzzle)
* When solution revealed, players say "oh, that makes sense!" not "how were we supposed to know that?"
* Players reference specific clues/testimony in their reasoning

### FAILURE MODES

* Players get stuck, can't find critical clue (investigation stalls)
* Solution is arbitrary or unsolvable from clues given
* Too much information, players overwhelmed and lost
* Everyone's lying but inconsistencies are just GM mistakes, not meaningful
* Players just accuse everyone until they get it right

### CURRENT SOLUTIONS & GAPS

**What People Do Now:**

* Pre-written mystery modules (players can look up answers online, or module has railroad solution)
* GM improvises mystery (hard to maintain consistency, easy to create contradictions)
* Gumshoe system (automatic clue finding, but still single-solution mysteries)
* Simple mysteries with obvious culprit (not satisfying for mystery fans)

**Why Insufficient:**

* Hard for human GM to track complex web of lies consistently
* If NPC lies during interrogation, GM must remember that lie in future interactions
* Creating genuinely solvable but non-obvious mysteries is time-intensive prep
* Players can "break" investigation by asking questions GM didn't anticipate

### IDEAL VS PRACTICAL (Two-Stage Design)

**Stage 1: Optimal System for Complex Mystery**

**The Design Question:** What system best supports "everyone's lying" mystery investigation?

**D\&D 5e's Weaknesses:**

* Investigation is skill check (can fail = story stops)
* Insight checks binary (they're lying or not)
* No mechanics for tracking complex information
* Combat-focused character sheets (investigation is afterthought)
* Social interaction is mostly roleplay (no systematic support)

**Better System Candidates:**

**Option A: Gumshoe (Trail of Cthulhu, Night's Black Agents)**

* **Core mechanic:** Automatic clue finding (if you have the skill, you find core clues)
* **Investigative spend:** Use points for extra info, insights, special benefits
* **Focus:** What you DO with clues, not whether you find them
* **Pros:** Guarantees forward momentum, prevents "missed clue" stall
* **Cons:** Still single-solution mysteries traditionally, deception not built-in
* **For this scenario:** Good foundation but needs enhancement for "everyone's lying"

**Option B: Brindlewood Bay**

* **Core mechanic:** Collaborative mystery solving - players invent solution from clues
* **No predetermined killer:** GM presents clues, players construct theory, game determines if it's true
* **Pros:** Creative, empowering, can't "guess wrong"
* **Cons:** Might feel arbitrary, not "fair-play" in traditional sense
* **For this scenario:** Interesting but wrong for players who want pre-determined solution

**Option C: Custom PbtA (Take 'Strings' from Monsterhearts)**

* **Core mechanic:** Investigation moves reveal information + relationships
* **Strings/Leverage:** Track what you know about NPCs, spend for advantage
* **Pros:** Social dynamics built-in, relationships mechanical
* **Cons:** Need custom design work, no off-the-shelf solution
* **For this scenario:** Could work well but requires design effort

**Option D: Fate (with Investigation extras)**

* **Core mechanic:** Create Advantages = discover aspects/clues
* **Aspects:** Can represent both clues ("Suspicious Timeline") and NPC secrets ("Hiding an Affair")
* **Pros:** Flexible, players contribute to investigation through aspects
* **Cons:** Very narrative-focused, might lack structure some players want
* **For this scenario:** Depends on group's preference for structure vs flexibility

**Optimal Choice Analysis:**

**For "fair-play, complex deception mystery":**

* **Best foundation:** Gumshoe (guarantees clue finding, focuses on interpretation)
* **Enhancement needed:** Add tracking for NPC secrets, lies, motivations
* **Specific implementation:**
  * Core clues automatic (Gumshoe)
  * Each NPC has 2-3 secrets (tracked systematically)
  * Interrogation reveals secrets through Insight spends or clever questions
  * Some secrets relevant to murder, some are red herrings
  * Players deduce from pattern of lies

**Recommended Optimal Design:**

* **System:** Gumshoe base + secret tracking + relationship web
* **Setting:** Choose based on group preference (classic mansion, corporate espionage, space station)
* **Structure:**
  * Crime scene investigation (automatic clue finding)
  * NPC interrogation (reveal secrets through investigation spend or roleplay)
  * Theory building (players assemble evidence)
  * Confrontation (players present case)
* **Why this works:** Combines guaranteed progress (Gumshoe) with complex social deception (custom additions)

**Stage 2: If They Want D\&D (Practical Adaptation)**

**Given that players say "but we only know D\&D":**

**D\&D Mystery Adaptation with LLM:**

**LLM Capabilities:**

* **Complex deception tracking:** Each NPC has consistent personality, secrets, alibis, lies
* **Natural language interrogation:** No "roll Insight" - players ask questions, NPCs respond based on their secrets
* **Clue management:** Ensures core clues are discoverable, tracks what players know
* **Contradiction detection:** When players notice inconsistencies in testimony
* **Fair-play guarantee:** LLM can't accidentally create unsolvable mystery

**Specific Implementation in D\&D:**

**Replace Skill Checks with Investigation Moves:**

* Don't roll to find clues in crime scene (you find them, LLM describes)
* Don't roll Insight to detect lies (players notice through questioning, not dice)
* DO roll for: chasing suspects, breaking into places, dangerous investigations
* Keep D\&D structure, change investigation resolution

**NPC Secret System:**
Each NPC has:

* **Public story:** What they tell everyone
* **Private secrets:** 2-3 things they're hiding
* **Lies:** Specific false statements about timeline, relationships, whereabouts
* **Truth trigger:** What makes them reveal secrets (evidence, leverage, empathy)

Example NPC:

* **Public:** "I was in my room all night"
* **Secret 1:** Was having affair with victim's spouse (not murderer, but hiding it)
* **Secret 2:** Saw someone else near victim's room (relevant clue)
* **Lie:** Timeline (says 10pm, was actually 11pm)
* **Truth trigger:** If confronted with evidence of affair, might reveal seeing someone

**Investigation Flow:**

1. **Crime scene:** Players automatically find core clues (no roll failure)
2. **Interrogation:** Players question NPCs in natural language
3. **LLM maintains consistency:** Each NPC's responses follow their secrets/lies
4. **Pattern recognition:** Players notice contradictions, follow up
5. **Theory building:** Players assemble evidence and present case

**Tradeoffs by Keeping D\&D:**

**What You Keep:**

* Familiar system (no learning curve)
* D\&D structure (stats, skills, levels)
* Combat available if needed (can have action scenes)
* Easy to recruit players

**What You Lose:**

* System doesn't support investigation (you're overriding core mechanics)
* Character sheets focused on combat (investigation is add-on)
* No mechanical framework for secrets/lies (you're building it manually)
* "Roll to investigate" instinct hard to break

**Honest Assessment:**
D\&D can be made to work for mysteries with heavy LLM support, but you're fighting the system. Gumshoe is purpose-built for this and would serve better. But if players absolutely won't learn new system, LLM can compensate by:

* Removing roll-to-find-clue failures
* Maintaining complex NPC deception
* Ensuring fair play through consistency

**Recommendation:** Try to convince group to try Gumshoe for one-shot. If they refuse, use D\&D with modifications above.

### DESIGN CHALLENGES

**Technical:**

* Clue distribution: ensure solvable without being obvious
* Deception modeling: NPCs lie convincingly but not impossibly
* Investigation tracking: system knows what players have discovered
* Solution validation: when players have enough evidence to solve

**Social:**

* Spotlight balance: investigation shouldn't be "one player questions everyone"
* Cooperative deduction: encourage players to share theories
* Frustration management: hints if truly stuck, not full solutions

**Ethical:**

* Fair play: players can solve this from available information
* Content warnings: murder mystery, lies, betrayal
* No unsolvable gotchas or arbitrary solutions

### VALIDATION

**How to Test:**

* Run mystery with 5+ NPCs, each with secrets
* Track: How many interrogations before players identify inconsistencies
* Track: Did players solve it? How long did it take?
* Survey: "Did you feel the mystery was fair?" (target: 100% yes)
* Survey: "Did you feel like you solved it vs were told the answer?" (target: 80%+ "I solved it")

**Who to Test With:**

* Mystery fans (read/watch mysteries regularly)
* Mix of experienced TTRPG players and newcomers
* At least one person who takes notes compulsively

***

## SCENARIO 3: Can't Find Group - Solo Play

### WHO ASKS FOR THIS

**Role:** Person who wants to play TTRPGs but doesn't have access to a group

**Exact Request (Multiple Variants):**

**Variant A - Geographic Isolation:**
"I just moved to a new city and don't know anyone yet. I miss playing D\&D. Is there something I can play solo while I find a group?"

**Variant B - Social Anxiety:**
"I'm interested in TTRPGs but group play is overwhelming. Can I try this solo first, in a lower-pressure way?"

**Variant C - Creative Tool:**
"I'm a writer. I use Tarot cards and journaling prompts for character development. Could a game system help me explore my story world?"

**Real Motivation:**

* Variant A: Temporary solution until finding group
* Variant B: Safe practice space, lower stakes
* Variant C: Creative/worldbuilding tool

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Time:** Flexible, can play in short bursts (30 mins) or longer sessions
* **Players:** 1 person, no GM
* **Setting:** Depends on variant (fantasy, sci-fi, contemporary, or custom world for writers)
* **Tone:** Varies - A wants adventure, B wants safe/gentle, C wants exploratory

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**What Player Experiences:**

* Variant A: Scratches the TTRPG itch until finding group
* Variant B: Builds confidence, feels safe to experiment
* Variant C: Generates creative insights, expands story world

**Observable Success:**

* Player returns for multiple sessions (not just one-off)
* Player makes meaningful choices (not just clicking through)
* Player emotionally engages with outcomes
* Variant A: Successfully transitions to group play later
* Variant C: Player incorporates discoveries into their writing

### FAILURE MODES

* Feels like interactive fiction (not a game)
* No meaningful choices (just random events)
* Too much bookkeeping (defeats "solo" simplicity)
* Feels lonely/empty without other players
* Variant B: Becomes overwhelming instead of safe space

### CURRENT SOLUTIONS & GAPS

**What People Do Now:**

* Solo RPG books (Thousand Year Old Vampire, Ironsworn)
* Journaling games with oracle/tarot draws
* Play both sides of a traditional TTRPG (unsatisfying)
* Video game RPGs (different feel from TTRPGs)
* AI Dungeon / Novel AI (often shallow, inconsistent)

**Why Insufficient:**

* Journal games require heavy player creativity (intimidating for B, not enough structure for A)
* Playing both sides removes surprise and challenge
* Video games don't have TTRPG's flexibility/creativity
* Current AI games often feel random, lack mechanical structure

### LLM OPPORTUNITY

**What Becomes Possible:**

* **Responsive without being adversarial:** LLM provides challenges/NPCs without "winning against player"
* **Surprise and discovery:** Player doesn't know what's coming (vs solo games where you see the oracle table)
* **Adaptive difficulty:** System can sense frustration and adjust
* **Multiple modes:** Can be adventure (A), gentle (B), or exploratory (C) based on player needs
* **Memory without bookkeeping:** LLM tracks world state, player just plays

**Specific Constraint Removed:**
Solo games require heavy creativity (journal games) or remove surprise (playing both sides). LLM provides opposition/world without requiring second player.

### DESIGN CHALLENGES

**Technical:**

* Balance: challenging but not unfair (no one to houserule)
* Pacing: maintain interest without group social energy
* Save/resume: must work in short bursts

**Social (paradoxically still applies):**

* Loneliness mitigation: NPCs feel alive enough to care about
* Safety (Variant B): gentle escalation, clear content controls
* Creative support (Variant C): prompt interesting directions without dictating

**Ethical:**

* Not replacement for human connection (especially B)
* Clear about limitations (this is not therapy for B)
* Variant B needs robust safety tools, content warnings, opt-outs
* Variant C respects player's creative ownership (LLM suggests, doesn't prescribe)

### VALIDATION

**How to Test:**

* Each variant needs separate testing
* Track: Session length and frequency (engagement metric)
* Track: Player choices (are they meaningful or just clicking?)
* Survey: "Did you feel engaged?" (target: 75%+)
* Survey: Variant A: "Did this satisfy TTRPG desire?" (target: 60%+, it's temporary solution)
* Survey: Variant B: "Did you feel safe?" (target: 90%+)
* Survey: Variant C: "Did this help your creative work?" (target: 70%+)

**Who to Test With:**

* Variant A: Experienced TTRPG players in transition (moved cities, group disbanded)
* Variant B: People with social anxiety interested in TTRPGs (recruit carefully, with therapist consultation)
* Variant C: Writers who already use creative tools (Tarot, writing prompts)

## SCENARIO 4: Ordinary People, Subtle Powers, Familiar Setting

### WHO ASKS FOR THIS

**Role:** Game designer or GM with a specific vision

**Exact Request:**
"I want to create a game about ordinary people discovering they have subtle powers in a familiar, realistic setting. Not superheroes - powers that could plausibly exist without being noticed. Powers that solve problems creatively, not just combat. Maybe set in my hometown, or the players' actual city. How do I design this from scratch?"

**Real Motivation:**

* Personal connection to setting (hometown nostalgia, local knowledge)
* Interest in "what if" speculation about hidden world
* Want creative problem-solving over combat
* Urban fantasy without the usual tropes

### DESIGN FREEDOM

* **Fixed constraints:**
  * Powers must be subtle (not obvious superpowers)
  * Setting must be realistic/familiar (not fantasy or sci-fi)
  * Powers have social consequences if revealed

* **Negotiable constraints:**
  * Specific city/location (could be hometown, or let players choose)
  * Tone (could be thriller, mystery, slice-of-life, or dark)
  * Group vs solo play

* **Open questions:**
  * What setting best serves "hidden powers in familiar world"?
  * What system creates right power level (subtle but meaningful)?
  * What genre/tone makes this most engaging?
  * What mechanics make secrecy matter?

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Time:** Variable - could be campaign or one-shot depending on design
* **Players:** 3-5 people, mix of experience levels
* **Setting:** This is the design question - modern? Historical? Near-future? Specific city?
* **Tone:** To be determined - what tone best serves the concept?

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**What Players Experience:**

* Feel grounded in familiar setting (recognize places, use local knowledge)
* Powers feel plausible and exciting (not just combat tools)
* Secrecy creates tension and meaningful choices
* Creative problem-solving rewarded
* Setting choice feels purposeful (not arbitrary)

**Observable Success:**

* Players use powers creatively for non-combat solutions
* Players worry about exposure/discovery (secrecy matters)
* Players reference real-world knowledge of setting
* System supports the concept (mechanics match intention)
* Designer can articulate why each design choice serves the vision

### FAILURE MODES

* Powers feel like regular superpowers (not subtle)
* Setting is generic (could be anywhere, no specificity)
* Secrecy doesn't matter mechanically or narratively
* Devolves into combat game (missing the point)
* System doesn't support the concept (wrong tools for the job)
* Design choices arbitrary (can't explain why modern vs historical, etc.)

### CURRENT SOLUTIONS & GAPS

**What People Do Now:**

* Use World of Darkness (Mage, Changeling) - but too high-powered and complex
* Homebrew D\&D in modern setting - system fights you (combat-focused)
* Fate/PbtA hacks - can work but often lack structure for subtle powers
* Existing urban fantasy games (Dresden Files RPG) - but often default to combat solutions

**Why Insufficient:**

* Most systems assume combat is primary conflict resolution
* "Subtle" is hard to mechanize - either becomes combat power or feels pointless
* Secrecy often just a narrative constraint, not mechanically interesting
* Generic modern setting lacks specificity and local flavor
* Haven't designed system and setting together for this specific purpose

### IDEAL VS PRACTICAL (Two-Stage Design)

**Stage 1: Optimal Design (Unconstrained)**

**Design Questions to Answer:**

1. **What setting best serves "hidden powers in familiar world"?**
   * Modern day (players' actual city)? Most familiar, easiest to verify
   * Historical (1920s, 1950s)? Adds period flavor, different social constraints
   * Near-future (10-20 years)? Familiar + speculation, tech considerations

2. **What makes powers feel "subtle"?**
   * Scale: Affects small area/few people, not city-destroying
   * Plausibility: Could be coincidence, luck, skill (not obviously magic)
   * Cost: Using power has price (exhaustion, risk, resource)
   * Examples: Perfect timing, minor probability manipulation, enhanced perception, temporary minor physical enhancement, empathy reading, memory manipulation (small scale)

3. **What tone serves this best?**
   * Thriller: Powers as tools for espionage, investigation
   * Mystery: Powers help solve crimes or uncover conspiracies
   * Slice-of-life: Powers make ordinary life interesting
   * Dark: Powers attract dangerous attention, come with price

4. **What system architecture?**
   * Skill-based (powers enhance normal abilities)?
   * Resource management (limited uses, must be strategic)?
   * Trigger-based (powers activate in specific situations)?
   * Narrative-first (describe what you do, system adjudicates)?

**Optimal Design Example:**

* **Setting:** Players' actual city, modern day (maximum familiarity and local knowledge)
* **Powers:** Small-scale probability manipulation, enhanced perception, minor physical enhancement, emotional reading - all explainable as luck/skill/intuition
* **Tone:** Mystery-thriller (use powers to investigate conspiracies, corporate espionage, or crime)
* **System:** Resource-based (limited power uses per session, must choose when to reveal abilities) + Consequence tracking (who notices? who suspects?)
* **Core Mechanic:** Powers give advantage in normal situations, but each use risks exposure (tracks accumulate, eventually someone investigates you)
* **Why this works:** Familiar setting maximizes player knowledge and immersion, subtle powers force creative problem-solving, exposure risk creates meaningful choices, mystery tone gives clear purpose for powers

**Stage 2: LLM Enhancement**

**What LLM Enables:**

* **Living city simulation:** NPCs remember interactions, city responds realistically to player actions
* **Exposure tracking:** System maintains complex web of "who saw what" without spreadsheet
* **Adaptive mystery:** Can generate investigations that use player powers meaningfully
* **Consequence propagation:** Power use has realistic social ripples (witness tells friend, security footage reviewed, pattern noticed)
* **Local knowledge database:** Can answer "what's actually at this address?" or "what would happen if..." using real geography

**Specific Constraint Removed:**
Human GM can't maintain consistent city-wide state (who knows what, who suspects, what patterns are visible). LLM tracks everything naturally.

### DESIGN CHALLENGES

**For Optimal Design:**

* **Conceptual:** Defining "subtle" (where's the line?)
* **Mechanical:** Making subtle powers feel impactful (not useless)
* **Narrative:** Secrecy creates tension (make exposure matter)
* **Setting:** Specific vs generic (too specific might alienate players)

**Technical (LLM-specific):**

* City simulation: maintain consistency across locations/NPCs
* Exposure modeling: track suspicion levels realistically
* Mystery generation: create solvable investigations that use powers meaningfully

**Social:**

* Player knowledge asymmetry: some know city better than others
* Power balance: subtle powers might feel weak compared to traditional games
* Creative problem-solving: system must reward non-combat solutions

**Ethical:**

* Real locations: be respectful of actual places/people
* Power fantasy: avoiding "superior hidden people" tropes
* Surveillance implications: tracking/exposure mechanics could feel creepy

### VALIDATION

**How to Test Optimal Design:**

* Build prototype system with example city (real or fictional)
* Define 3-5 example "subtle powers"
* Create test scenario (mystery to solve using powers)
* Track: Do players use powers creatively (non-combat)?
* Track: Do players worry about exposure?
* Survey: "Did setting feel specific and alive?" (target: 70%+)
* Survey: "Did powers feel too weak/too strong/just right?" (target: 60%+ "just right")
* Survey: "Could you explain why design choices (modern vs historical, this city, etc.)?" (designer should be able to)

**Who to Test With:**

* Mix of experienced and new TTRPG players
* People who know the chosen city/setting well
* People interested in urban fantasy but not traditional fantasy
* Creative problem-solvers (not just combat-focused players)

**Design Validation Questions:**

* Can designer justify every major choice (setting, tone, power scale, mechanics)?
* Do choices serve the core concept (subtle powers in familiar setting)?
* Is there coherent vision, or arbitrary decisions?

## SCENARIO 5: Sci-Fi Fans Want Truly Alien Cognition

### WHO ASKS FOR THIS

**Role:** Science fiction enthusiasts frustrated with "humans in rubber suits" aliens

**Exact Request:**
"I'm tired of aliens in sci-fi RPGs that are just humans with different cultures. Vulcans are logical humans. Klingons are warrior humans. I want aliens that THINK differently - that perceive reality differently. Can we play something where other perspectives are actually alien, not just foreign?"

**Alternative Variant - Neuroscience Student:**
"I want to run a game where characters have different neurological conditions - synesthesia, prosopagnosia, aphantasia, savant syndrome - not as disabilities but as different ways of perceiving the world. What would it be like to see sounds as colors, or be unable to recognize faces?"

**Real Motivation:**

* Intellectual challenge and novelty
* "Hard sci-fi" interest in actual cognitive differences
* Want to experience perspective-taking at deep level
* Frustrated with shallow "exotic culture" aliens

### DESIGN FREEDOM

* **Fixed constraints:**
  * Must involve genuinely different cognition (not just "different culture")
  * Must be playable (players can engage, not just frustrated)

* **Negotiable constraints:**
  * Genre (sci-fi aliens vs neuroscience vs fantasy fae)
  * Setting specificity (space exploration vs near-future Earth vs fantasy realm)
  * Scale (everyone is different vs one player vs NPCs only)

* **Open questions:**
  * What setting best explores cognitive difference?
  * How much difference is playable vs overwhelming?
  * What mechanics support experiencing different perception?

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Time:** Short campaign (4-8 sessions) or one-shot (6+ hours)
* **Players:** 3-4 people, interested in sci-fi/neuroscience, comfortable with experimental play
* **Setting:** Sci-fi (space exploration, first contact) or near-future (neurological diversity)
* **Tone:** Exploratory and wonder-focused, not horror (though unsettling is okay)

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**What Players Experience:**

* Genuine sense of "thinking differently"
* Moments of "oh, this perspective would solve/see this problem completely differently"
* Empathy through perspective-taking
* Intellectual satisfaction from grappling with alien logic

**Observable Success:**

* Players describe solutions using their character's unique perception
* Players struggle (productively) to "get into" alien mindset
* Players have "aha" moments when alien perspective makes sense
* Players continue thinking about it after session

### FAILURE MODES

* Too confusing (players frustrated, can't engage)
* Too shallow (just different words for same human thinking)
* Feels like disability simulation in bad way (othering, inspiration porn)
* "Superintelligence" problem: trying to play smarter-than-human character feels fake

### CURRENT SOLUTIONS & GAPS

**What People Do Now:**

* Traditional sci-fi RPGs with "cultures" (Star Trek Adventures, Traveller)
* GM describes alien perspective, players play humans (doesn't achieve goal)
* Players read descriptions of conditions/alien thought, try to roleplay it (inconsistent)
* Powered by the Apocalypse hacks (Impulse Drive) - better but still limited

**Why Insufficient:**

* Human GM can't actually think like alien or with different neurology
* Players default to human cognition with window dressing
* Descriptions don't create experience of thinking differently
* "Just roleplay it" is too freeform, needs structure/support

### IDEAL VS PRACTICAL (Two-Stage Design)

**Stage 1: Optimal Setting for Cognitive Difference**

**The Design Question:** What setting best lets players experience genuinely different cognition?

**Option A: Science Fiction (Space Aliens)**

* **Pros:** Expected genre for "alien" thinking, freedom to invent
* **Cons:** No baseline to compare against, hard to make feel real vs arbitrary
* **Examples:** Heptapods (Arrival), Solaris's ocean-mind, Blindsight's vampires
* **Challenge:** Creating alien that's comprehensible enough to play

**Option B: Neuroscience (Human Neurodiversity)**

* **Pros:** Real conditions we can research, players can verify against reality
* **Cons:** Must be respectful, avoid ableism, not all conditions are "interesting" to play
* **Examples:** Synesthesia, prosopagnosia, aphantasia, savant syndrome, split-brain
* **Challenge:** Making it experiential, not just descriptive

**Option C: Fantasy/Mythological (Fae, Spirits, Non-Human)**

* **Pros:** Can use established mythology + invention, less rigid than hard sci-fi
* **Cons:** Easy to fall into "exotic culture" not genuinely different cognition
* **Examples:** Fae with non-linear time perception, spirits with collective consciousness
* **Challenge:** Distinguishing "different cognition" from "different values"

**Option D: Psychological/Philosophical (Altered Human Perception)**

* **Pros:** Relatable baseline with specific change, can explore "what if" safely
* **Cons:** Needs careful framing to avoid trivializing real conditions
* **Examples:** Perceiving time differently, seeing probability clouds, experiencing others' emotions
* **Challenge:** Making philosophical speculation feel concrete

**Optimal Choice Analysis:**

**For "genuinely alien cognition that's playable":**

* **Best:** Option B (Neurodiversity) or D (Altered perception)
* **Why:** Grounded in reality → easier to maintain consistency and player buy-in
* **Specific approach:** Start with ONE altered perception (synesthesia), let players experience it for a session before adding complexity

**For "exploring Blindsight-style superintelligence":**

* **Best:** Option A (Sci-fi) but with realistic near-future frame
* **Why:** Need speculative freedom, but grounding in neuroscience makes it credible
* **Specific approach:** Not "play the vampire" but "encounter the vampire" - NPCs are superintelligent, players experience being out-thought

**Recommended Optimal Design:**

* **Setting:** Near-future (20-30 years) where neurological enhancement/modification exists
* **Concept:** Players have undergone different enhancement procedures (synesthesia implant, time-perception alteration, emotional-reading augmentation)
* **Tone:** Cyberpunk investigation - use your enhanced perception to solve problems
* **Why this works:** Grounded enough to feel real, speculative enough for freedom, clear purpose for different perception (investigation tools)

**Stage 2: If They Insist on Space Opera Sci-Fi**

**Given that players want "space exploration, alien contact, Blindsight vibes":**

**LLM Capabilities for Sci-Fi Aliens:**

* **Simulation of alien cognition:** LLM maintains consistent alien perspective across all interactions
* **Describe through alien lens:** Present scenes from alien POV (they don't see "faces," they see "pheromone signatures")
* **Translation problems:** Alien concepts that don't map to human language
* **Superintelligence handling:** LLM tracks patterns/information beyond player capacity, reveals alien is ahead of players

**Specific Implementation:**

**Example 1: Time-Perceiving Aliens (Heptapod-style)**

* LLM describes events non-linearly: "The alien gestures at what will be the explosion site" (future-tense for present action)
* Communication requires players to think non-causally
* Players slowly realize aliens experience time differently

**Example 2: Collective Intelligence (Hive Mind)**

* No individual identity - LLM refers to aliens as "we/us" even in singular
* Decision-making is instantaneous consensus, players can't negotiate with individuals
* Players must think about how to communicate with collective entity

**Example 3: Solipsistic Aliens (Only Their Experience Exists)**

* Aliens don't acknowledge external reality - everything is their mental state
* LLM describes interactions where aliens treat players as hallucinations/mental constructs
* Communication requires players to work within alien's reality-model

**Tradeoffs by Choosing Sci-Fi:**

**What You Keep:**

* Freedom to invent without real-world constraints
* "Cool" factor of space opera
* Ability to explore Blindsight-specific ideas (vampires, consciousness)
* Genre expectations of sci-fi fans

**What You Lose:**

* Grounding (harder to verify if alien cognition is consistent vs arbitrary)
* Accessibility (neurodiversity frame would be more relatable)
* Research base (can't consult neuroscience papers, must invent)
* Risk of "exotic culture" slippage (values vs cognition)

**Making Sci-Fi Work:**
To avoid "humans in rubber suits" in sci-fi frame:

1. **Root in actual neuroscience speculation:** "What if consciousness evolved for X instead of Y?"
2. **Consistency above coolness:** Alien cognition must follow rules, not be random
3. **One big difference, not many:** Heptapods are "just" non-linear time perceivers, but that's profound
4. **LLM maintains it:** Human GM would slip into human thinking; LLM can maintain alien frame

**Honest Assessment:**
Sci-fi is the expected genre but not necessarily the best. Near-future neuroscience frame would be more grounded and playable. But if players want space opera, you can make it work - just commit fully to alien cognition, don't compromise back to "exotic humans."

### DESIGN CHALLENGES

**Technical:**

* Simulation fidelity: alien perspective must be consistent and logical
* Accessibility: different enough to be interesting, similar enough to be playable
* Gradual introduction: start simple, add complexity as players acclimate
* Superintelligence problem: how to handle "smarter than players" without feeling fake

**Social:**

* Not ableist: neurological differences as variations, not deficits
* Not othering: aim is empathy and understanding, not "look how weird"
* Player frustration: challenging but not impossible
* Group coherence: if everyone perceives differently, how do they communicate?

**Ethical:**

* Consultation: neurodivergent people should be involved in design
* Respectful representation: not inspiration porn or tragedy
* Not claiming therapeutic value: this is perspective-taking exercise, not treatment
* Content warnings: some people may find simulation of their condition uncomfortable

### VALIDATION

**How to Test:**

* Start simple: one player has one different perception (synesthesia)
* Track: Can player describe their perspective consistently?
* Track: Do other players understand and engage with it?
* Survey: "Did you feel like you were thinking differently?" (target: 60%+, this is hard)
* Survey: "Was this respectful/interesting vs othering?" (target: 90%+)
* Consult: Have neurodivergent people review/play-test

**Who to Test With:**

* Sci-fi fans comfortable with experimental play
* Mix of neurotypical and neurodivergent players
* People interested in "hard sci-fi" cognitive speculation
* Include consultant from neuroscience/psychology field

**Note:** This scenario is intellectually ambitious and may need significant iteration. Start small (one altered perception) before attempting fully alien cognition.

## SCENARIO 6: Designer Ethics Challenge - Handling Difficult Topics

### WHO ASKS FOR THIS

**Role:** Game designer wanting to create game about difficult subject matter

**Exact Request:**
"I want to make a game about \[war/trauma/grief/discrimination/mental health]. I want it to be meaningful and honest, not exploitative. But I'm worried about doing it wrong. Where's the line between meaningful exploration and trauma porn? How do I design responsibly?"

**Real Motivation:**

* Artistic integrity and representation
* Personal experience they want to process/share
* Educational/empathy-building goal
* Fear of causing harm

### CONSTRAINTS

* **Time:** N/A (this is design framework, not specific game)
* **Players:** Varies by specific topic
* **Setting:** Varies by specific topic
* **Tone:** Respectful, not exploitative

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**What Designer Achieves:**

* Clear understanding of ethical boundaries
* Framework for testing "is this harmful?"
* Consultation process with affected communities
* Safety tools integrated from start, not added later

**Observable Success:**

* Playtesters from affected community approve
* No one traumatized during playtesting
* Players report meaningful experience, not just "dark" or "edgy"
* Designer can articulate why specific design choices are ethical

### FAILURE MODES

* Trauma porn (exploitation for shock/drama)
* Inspiration porn (disabled/traumatized people as objects of pity)
* Saviorism (designer thinks they're "helping" without consulting)
* Triggering content without warnings/tools
* False claims of therapeutic value

### CURRENT SOLUTIONS & GAPS

**What People Do Now:**

* X-Card and other safety tools (good but not sufficient alone)
* Content warnings (good but reactive, not proactive design)
* "Consult marginalized people" (good advice, but how? when? how much?)
* Avoid difficult topics entirely (safe but limits medium)

**Why Insufficient:**

* Safety tools address symptoms, not root design issues
* Content warnings don't make exploitative content ethical
* Consultation can be tokenistic if done wrong
* Avoidance means important stories don't get told

### FRAMEWORK FOR RESPONSIBLE DESIGN

**Stage 1: Interrogate Your Motivation**

* Why this topic? Personal experience? Ally work? Curiosity?
* Who is this for? People with experience? People learning? Both?
* What do you want players to feel/understand?
* Are you the right person to make this? (Honest answer required)

**Stage 2: Research and Consultation**

* Read extensively from affected communities (first-person accounts, not just academic)
* Identify consultants early (paid, credited, with authority to veto)
* Understand the diversity within the community (no monolithic "disabled perspective")
* Learn existing safety tools and why they exist

**Stage 3: Design Principles**

* **Agency:** Players must have control (opposite of real trauma)
* **Not Surprise:** Telegraph difficult content, never spring it without warning
* **Opt-out always available:** X-card, lines/veils, safe words
* **Purpose over shock:** Every difficult moment must serve experiential/educational goal
* **Consultation checkpoints:** Show consultants before, during, after playtesting

**Stage 4: Safety Tools (Integrated, Not Added)**

* Pre-game discussion: What topics are in scope? What's off limits for this group?
* Lines and Veils: Hard limits vs "happens off-screen"
* X-Card: Stop this content immediately, no questions
* Open Door: Players can leave without explanation
* Debrief: After session, check in with everyone

**Stage 5: Playtesting Ethics**

* Recruit playtesters from affected community (paid, if possible)
* Clear informed consent: "This game explores \[topic]. It may be difficult."
* Debrief thoroughly: "How did that feel? Was anything harmful?"
* Iterate based on feedback: Be willing to cut content
* Don't playtest on people more vulnerable than your target audience

**Stage 6: Publication Ethics**

* Clear content warnings (specific, not vague "mature themes")
* Credit consultants prominently
* Acknowledge limitations ("this is one perspective")
* Don't claim therapeutic value (not therapy, not treatment)
* Provide resources if appropriate (hotlines, organizations)

### SPECIFIC TOPIC CONSIDERATIONS

**Mental Health (Anxiety, Depression, PTSD):**

* **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER:** This is not therapy. Not treatment. If you're in crisis, here are real resources.
* Consult mental health professionals and people with lived experience
* Avoid: "Just talk about it and you'll feel better" or other treatment trivializations
* Consider: "For people with experience" vs "for people learning about it" are different designs
* Mechanics should not punish players for character's mental health (no "lose turn because depressed")

**War and Violence:**

* Distinguish: action movie violence vs realistic trauma of war
* If exploring PTSD/combat trauma, see mental health section
* Avoid: glorification, "cool" violence that ignores consequences
* Consider: Whose perspective? Soldier? Civilian? Medic? All different.

**Discrimination (Racism, Sexism, etc.):**

* Consult affected communities extensively
* Avoid: Asking marginalized people to relive trauma for your game
* Consider: Is the game FOR marginalized people or ABOUT educating privileged people? (Very different designs)
* Never force players to roleplay receiving discrimination without explicit consent

**Grief and Loss:**

* More universal than other topics (everyone experiences loss)
* But: Some losses are more charged (child loss, suicide, sudden violence)
* Safety tools essential: some players may have recent trauma
* Can be cathartic or retraumatizing depending on design and player state

### THE LINE: Meaningful vs Exploitative

**Exploitative (Don't Do This):**

* Shock value without purpose
* "Dark and edgy" for the sake of being dark
* Disabled/traumatized characters as inspiration or pity objects
* Designer's curiosity at expense of affected people's comfort
* Claiming therapeutic benefits without clinical basis

**Meaningful (Aim For This):**

* Clear experiential or educational purpose
* Agency and control for players
* Consultation with affected communities throughout
* Safety tools integrated from design start
* Honest about limitations and perspective
* Respects player boundaries absolutely

**The Test:**
Can you explain to someone from the affected community:

1. Why you're making this
2. What you want players to understand
3. Why your design choices serve that goal
4. How you've protected player safety

If you can't answer all four, you're not ready to design this yet.

### LLM CONSIDERATIONS

**Opportunities:**

* Adaptive content: Can adjust difficulty/intensity based on player comfort
* Safety monitoring: Can watch for signs of player distress (disengagement, short responses)
* Personalization: Can tailor experience to player's stated comfort level

**Risks:**

* No human judgment: LLM can't make ethical calls about "is this player okay?"
* Unpredictability: LLM might generate content outside safety parameters
* False safety: Appearance of infinite adaptability might make designer complacent

**Requirements for LLM systems handling difficult topics:**

* Hard-coded safety boundaries (content that never appears)
* Human oversight during playtesting (not just "let LLM handle it")
* Clear escalation paths: "This is harder than X-card, here are real resources"
* Consultation about what LLM should/shouldn't be able to generate

### VALIDATION

This scenario is different - validation is about the FRAMEWORK, not a specific game.

**How to Test Framework:**

* Apply to multiple sensitive topics
* Does it catch obviously harmful designs?
* Does it provide actionable guidance?
* Do consultants find it useful and respectful?

**Red Flags That Framework Failed:**

* Designer proceeds without consultation
* Designer dismisses safety concerns as "too sensitive"
* Designer claims game is "therapeutic" without clinical basis
* Playtesters report harm
* Designer prioritizes their vision over player safety

### CONCLUSION

**Making games about difficult topics is not inherently wrong.** But it requires:

* Rigorous self-interrogation
* Extensive consultation
* Prioritizing player safety over designer vision
* Humility about limitations
* Willingness to not make the game if you can't do it ethically

**Some topics you should not design without lived experience or very extensive consultation.** This is not censorship - it's recognizing that some stories require insider knowledge to tell responsibly.

**The goal is not to avoid difficult topics.** The goal is to handle them with the care they deserve.

## Understanding the Two-Stage Design Framework

Several scenarios in this document use a **two-stage analysis**: Ideal vs Practical. This framework helps you think about design in two different modes.

### Why Two Stages?

**The Problem:**
Real people come with constraints: "I want this, but only in D\&D" or "I want sci-fi specifically." As a designer, you need to understand:

1. What's the optimal solution (unconstrained thinking)?
2. How do I work within real constraints (practical adaptation)?
3. What am I sacrificing by accepting those constraints?

**The Goal:**

* **Learn to design optimally** (Stage 1: "What system/setting BEST serves this purpose?")
* **Learn to adapt practically** (Stage 2: "Given constraints, what's the best solution?")
* **Understand tradeoffs** (What do you lose? What do you keep?)

### When to Use Each Stage

**Stage 1 - Ideal Design (Unconstrained):**

Use when:

* Starting a new project from scratch
* Players are open to suggestions
* You have freedom to choose system/setting
* You want to learn optimal design thinking

Questions to ask:

* What experiential goal am I serving?
* What setting best supports that goal?
* What system architecture fits that experience?
* Why this choice over alternatives?

**Stage 2 - Practical Adaptation (Constrained):**

Use when:

* Players insist on specific system ("but we love D\&D")
* Setting is predetermined ("must be sci-fi")
* You're adapting existing campaign
* Switching systems has high cost

Questions to ask:

* What constraints are truly fixed vs negotiable?
* How do I work within these limits?
* What LLM capabilities compensate for system weaknesses?
* What tradeoffs am I making?

### Learning from Both Stages

**For Students:**

* Stage 1 teaches you system selection and purpose-driven design
* Stage 2 teaches you practical adaptation and working with constraints
* Comparing stages teaches you to recognize tradeoffs

**For Experienced Designers:**

* Stage 1 helps you question assumptions ("Why D\&D? Because we always use D\&D")
* Stage 2 helps you be realistic about what's achievable
* Both together help you know when to push back vs when to adapt

### The Tradeoff Section

Each two-stage scenario includes "What You Keep / What You Lose" analysis.

**Purpose:**

* Make tradeoffs explicit (not hidden)
* Help you explain to players why system matters
* Inform your adaptation strategy

**Example:**
If players insist on D\&D for mystery game:

* **Keep:** Familiar system, easy recruitment, tactical combat available
* **Lose:** System doesn't support investigation, fighting against mechanics, investigation always feels secondary

**Knowing this helps you:**

* Explain why Gumshoe might be better (but respect their choice)
* Focus adaptation efforts on biggest weaknesses
* Set appropriate expectations

### When to Push Back on Constraints

**You should question constraints when:**

* The constraint directly conflicts with the goal ("D\&D for political intrigue")
* A better solution exists and is learnable ("Try Blades for one session")
* The tradeoffs are severe (fundamental mismatch)

**You should accept constraints when:**

* Switching cost is too high (ongoing campaign)
* Player investment is deep (love their D\&D characters)
* Constraint is non-negotiable (time limits)
* Adaptation is viable (LLM can compensate)

**How to push back effectively:**

* "D\&D works, but have you considered \[system] which is built for this?"
* "Let's try \[system] for a one-shot. If you hate it, we adapt D\&D."
* "Here's what we'd gain vs what we'd lose by switching."

### Scenarios by Type

**Constrained (Accept realistic limits):**

* Scenario 1: Busy Adults - Time constraint is real and fixed
* Scenario 3: Mystery (Stage 2) - If they insist on D\&D
* Scenario 2: Alien Cognition (Stage 2) - If they insist on space opera

**Two-Stage (Question then adapt):**

* Scenario 1: Busy Adults - Maybe not D\&D?
* Scenario 2: Alien Cognition - Maybe not sci-fi?
* Scenario 3: Mystery - Maybe not D\&D?

**Unconstrained (Design from scratch):**

* Scenario 4: Subtle Powers - Everything is open
* Scenario 5: Solo Play - Choose best format for purpose
* Scenario 6: Designer Ethics - Framework, not specific game

### Using This Framework

**When designing:**

1. Start with Stage 1 (Ideal) - think unconstrained
2. Identify what you'd choose and why
3. Move to Stage 2 (Practical) - apply real constraints
4. Analyze tradeoffs explicitly
5. Make informed decision (push back or adapt)

**When talking to players:**

1. Show them the ideal solution
2. Explain why it's better for their goal
3. Respect their constraints if they insist
4. Be clear about tradeoffs
5. Adapt system to mitigate weaknesses

### The Meta-Lesson

**The framework itself teaches:**

* Purpose determines optimal system (not tradition)
* Constraints are real but should be questioned
* Adaptation is possible but has costs
* Informed choices beat default choices

**For LLM-enabled design:**

* LLMs can help adapt suboptimal systems
* But they can't make D\&D into Gumshoe fundamentally
* LLMs work best when system and purpose align
* Use LLM capabilities for enhancement, not complete replacement

***

## Using These Scenarios

### As Design Criteria

For each system you design, ask:

* Which of these scenarios could it handle?
* Which would it fail at?
* What modifications would make it work?

### As Test Cases

When you have a prototype:

* Pick relevant scenario
* Recruit appropriate playtesters
* Run validation tests
* Iterate based on results

### As Thought Exercises

Even if you never build these specific games:

* They force you to think about real constraints
* They reveal what's genuinely hard vs theoretically interesting
* They ground abstract design thinking in reality

### Reality Check

If you can't explain why someone would want to play your design:

* Refer back to these scenarios
* Find the real human need
* Design for that, not for abstraction

***

## Appendix: Scenario Selection Notes

**Why These Six?**

1. **Coverage:** Technical challenges, social dynamics, ethical boundaries
2. **Realism:** All based on real requests or common problems
3. **Difficulty range:** From straightforward (#1) to extremely complex (#6)
4. **LLM relevance:** Each tests different LLM capabilities
5. **Groundedness:** Can recruit players and actually test these

**What's Not Included (And Why):**

* **Kids' introduction to TTRPGs:** Important but different constraints (safety, simplicity). Deserves separate deep dive.
* **Educational games for specific subjects:** Too broad, needs per-subject analysis.
* **Therapeutic applications:** Explicitly avoided except as ethical boundary case. Games are not therapy.
* **MMO-style persistent worlds:** Technical complexity deserves separate treatment.

**How to Expand This Set:**

If you encounter a real request that doesn't fit these scenarios:

1. Write it up using the template
2. Test against reality check ("Can I recruit players?")
3. Identify what new thing it tests
4. Add to set if it reveals new design challenges

The goal is not comprehensive coverage - it's representative, testable, real scenarios that drive good design thinking.
