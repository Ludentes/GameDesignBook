# What is a Game System?

## Introduction: Beyond "The Rules"

A game system is not simply "the rules." It's not a resolution mechanic (d20, 2d6, cards). It's not a collection of subsystems bolted together.

**A game system is the designed interplay between mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing that creates a reproducible experience through player interaction with internal rules.**

This definition emerges from examining how actual game systems—both foundational and experimental—have evolved, failed, and succeeded. Rather than theoretical ideal, it's grounded in how designers have solved concrete problems across fifty years of game design history.

## Part 1: The Foundational Systems

### Why D\&D and Civilization Matter

D\&D and Civilization are foundational for a reason: they **defined categories** and showed designers what's possible at scale. They're not the only important systems, but they're historically necessary.

**D\&D** (1974 to present) demonstrates:

* How systems survive radical redesign (five complete editions)
* What must stay constant (six attributes, levels, hit points)
* How mechanical changes cascade into different experiences (3e vs. 5e)
* The limits of complexity (3.5e's baroque optimization vs. 5e's elegant simplicity)
* That player identity matters more than mechanical elegance

**Civilization** (1991 to present) demonstrates:

* How systems manage complexity over time (Civ I simple → Civ IV complex → Civ V simplified → Civ VI smartly complex)
* That spatial/visual complexity feels different from numerical complexity
* How feedback loops create compulsion ("one more turn")
* That multiple paths to success creates replayability
* How interface IS part of the system (adjacency bonuses in Civ VI changed strategy)

These aren't equal to all other systems—they're foundational because they showed categories of problems and solutions that every other designer builds from or reacts against.

### D\&D's 50-Year Evolution: What Systems Must Manage

**The core pattern:** D\&D shows how designers respond to specific problems each edition identifies.

**OD\&D → AD\&D (1974-1977):** Players needed consistent rulings for tournament play. Solution: Codify everything. Lesson: Systematization enables markets but constrains emergent play.

**AD\&D 2e → 3e (1989-2000):** Every resolution mechanic was different (Thac0 for combat, ability checks variable, saves on tables). Solution: Unified d20 system. Lesson: One elegant core mechanic unifies experience, but invites endless expansion.

**3.5e → 4e (2008):** Martial classes were underpowered compared to casters; system had grown baroque. Solution: Powers system for everyone, tactical grid emphasis. Result: Technically superior but commercially failed (Pathfinder outsold it). Lesson: Mechanical excellence alone is insufficient; you must preserve what players love.

**4e → 5e (2014):** 4e felt like a board game, not D\&D. Solution: Return to tradition with modern design (advantage/disadvantage, bounded accuracy). Result: Most successful edition ever. Lesson: Sometimes simplification > innovation.

**What D\&D teaches about systems:**

* Core identity matters more than mechanical perfection (six attributes remained constant through five editions)
* Can't fix problems by violating identity (4e proved this)
* Simplicity, carefully designed, beats complex optimization
* Accessibility expands audiences (5e's triumph)
* Systems evolve in response to specific problems, but solutions must preserve purpose

### Civilization's 25-Year Progression: Complexity and Pacing

**The parallel evolution:** Civilization shows what happens when you manage complexity in a computed medium (no human adjudication required).

**I → II → III → IV:** Each added systems. Depth increased, tedium increased.

**IV → V:** Radical simplification. Removed Religion, Espionage, Corporations. Changed fundamental interaction (One Unit Per Tile instead of stacking). Hexagonal grid instead of square. Reception: Divisive. Hardcore players hated simplification. New players loved accessibility.

**V → VI:** Managed complexity return. Districts (spatial complexity) instead of numerical optimization. Eureka moments (guiding progression instead of pure freedom). Result: Depth without tedium.

**What Civilization teaches about systems:**

* Complexity is a budget; spend wisely
* Spatial/visual complexity (districts) feels better than numerical complexity (spreadsheets)
* Positive feedback loops create compulsion (cities grow → more production → faster growth)
* Near-miss losses drive replays ("if only I'd built that three turns earlier")
* Short-term goals (units finishing soon) + long-term planning (fifty turns to victory) creates "one more turn" feeling
* UI/interface matters as much as mechanics

## Part 2: The Revolutionary Systems

### PbtA's Different Model: Same Engine, Different Implementations

**Where D\&D evolves one system, PbtA proves that one engine supports many purposes.**

Powered by the Apocalypse (2010) introduced a fiction-first resolution model:

```
When you [specific action in fiction], roll 2d6 + stat:
- 10+: Success
- 7-9: Success with cost/complication
- 6-: Failure, GM makes a move
```

This created an engine that spawned descendants, each reconfiguring the same core for different purposes:

| Game             | Purpose                   | Key Reconfiguration                                           | Result                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Apocalypse World | Post-apocalyptic survival | Resources scarce, threats constant, morally ambiguous         | Gritty, harsh, player agency                   |
| Dungeon World    | D\&D fantasy              | Traditional classes, forgiving HP, treasure focus             | Heroic, adventurous, clear goals               |
| Monsterhearts    | Teen supernatural drama   | Labels (not fixed stats), Strings (social capital), sex moves | Intimate, social warfare, fluid identity       |
| The Sprawl       | Cyberpunk heists          | Mission structure, corporate threats, hacker subsystem        | Tactical, organized, team-based                |
| Masks            | Teen superheroes          | No stats (Labels shift), emotional conditions, coming-of-age  | Identity-focused, dependent-to-independent arc |

**Same 2d6 + stat core. Completely different games.**

What changed:

* What moves exist (triggered by fiction)
* What resources matter (Barter vs. Strings vs. Influence)
* What stats represent (survival skills vs. social identity vs. how others see you)
* What playbooks embody (survival roles vs. fantasy classes vs. teen archetypes)
* What success looks like (freedom vs. heroism vs. social validation vs. mission completion vs. maturity)

**Why PbtA matters:** It proves that identical mechanics can serve opposite experiences through configuration, not mechanics. It also proves this principle works at scale (dozens of PbtA games, thriving community).

**What PbtA teaches:**

* Simple core mechanics enable more variation than complex ones
* Configuration (moves, stats, resources, playbooks) determines experience more than resolution mechanic
* Purpose determines moves; moves determine play
* Same engine can serve niche audiences (heist thriller, teen drama) that demand different experiences

## Part 3: The Academic Framework

### MDA (Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics)

The MDA framework, formalized by Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek (2004), provides essential vocabulary:

**Mechanics:** The rules, data, algorithms (what designers directly control)

**Dynamics:** The runtime behavior (what emerges when mechanics interact and players engage)

**Aesthetics:** The emotional responses players experience (what players actually feel)

**Critical insight:** Design flows **Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics** (cause to effect), but designers should **START with Aesthetics** (desired experience), then work backward to design mechanics that create it.

Most failed designs reverse this: "I have cool mechanics (cards! timers! powers!) → what experience can I make?" This is backwards. Successful designs start: "I want players to feel X → what mechanics create that?"

**How D\&D 5e used this correctly:**

1. Desired aesthetic: Accessible, heroic fantasy that feels traditionally D\&D
2. Designed mechanics: Advantage/disadvantage (simple), bounded accuracy (elegant), backgrounds (narrative)
3. Result: Perfect alignment between intended experience and mechanics

**How D\&D 4e failed this:**

1. Desired aesthetic: Balanced, tactical combat
2. Designed mechanics: Powers system, grid-mandatory, roles
3. Problem: Mechanics screamed "board game" while context said "D\&D"
4. Result: Mechanics-first design, aesthetics didn't match

### Ludology and Emergence

Ludology (the academic study of games as rule-based systems) identifies that **systems with relatively simple rules can produce complex, emergent behaviors** that designers don't explicitly program.

Examples:

* **Chess:** Simple rules (how pieces move), infinitely complex emergent play
* **Minecraft:** Simple core (place/break blocks), emerges as storytelling engine, engineering platform, creative canvas
* **Dwarf Fortress:** Thousands of simple rules interact, producing legendary stories (and catastrophes)
* **Emergent Narrative in Deus Ex:** Designer surprised when players used wall-mounted mines as climbing pitons

**Key insight:** Emergence happens when simple rules interact without designers prescripting all outcomes. This is powerful but risky—you must test extensively because you can't predict everything.

### Player Types (Bartle and Evolution)

Richard Bartle's player taxonomy (1996) identifies four types of players:

| Type       | Wants                                 | Example Behavior                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Achiever   | Points, status, completion            | Collecting achievements, optimizing builds |
| Explorer   | Discovery, new things, secrets        | Exploring maps, finding hidden areas       |
| Socializer | Interaction, community, relationships | Joining guilds, playing with friends       |
| Killer     | Competition, dominance, victory       | PvP, defeating others, proving superiority |

**Systems serve different player types.** A system optimized for Achievers (leaderboards, rankings, clear progression) may alienate Explorers (who want mystery, not optimization).

This explains why **same mechanic, different context** serves different players:

* Weather Factory's Cultist Simulator serves Explorers (discovery) and suits Socializers (mysterious community)
* Book of Hours serves Explorers (gentle discovery) and Achievers (library cataloging progression)
* Competitive games serve Killers and Achievers
* Narrative-heavy games serve Socializers and Explorers

**Key insight:** No system serves all player types equally. Successful design targets specific player types and builds mechanics, resources, and context around them.

## Part 4: Parameters, Not Just Mechanics

### The Configuration Model

The deepest design insight doesn't come from inventing new mechanics. It comes from understanding that **mechanics are configured through parameters to serve specific purposes.**

**Parameters are the "how much / how fast / how dangerous / how forgiving" variables.**

Example: Both D\&D's Short Rest and traditional game rests use identical mechanics (wait, recover resources), but parameters differ:

| Parameter     | Short Rest (5e)                           | Traditional Rest                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Duration      | 1 hour                                    | 8 hours                                |
| Recovery      | Partial (hit dice)                        | Full                                   |
| Frequency     | Multiple per day                          | Once per day                           |
| Pacing effect | Multiple encounters → resource management | Encounter-per-rest → different tension |

Same mechanic (rest), different parameters, completely different experience.

**Weather Factory Example (Where It Fits Properly):**

Weather Factory's three games (Cultist Simulator, Exile, Book of Hours) use identical core mechanics (card + verb + timer) but reconfigure parameters:

| Parameter     | Cultist Simulator            | Exile                  | Book of Hours       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Scarcity      | Extreme                      | Finite                 | Abundant            |
| Time pressure | Death drain every 60s        | Pursuit escalation     | None                |
| Threat        | Constant (Dread, Starvation) | Relentless (Reckoners) | Practically none    |
| Board size    | Unlimited (overwhelm)        | Tiny (forced travel)   | Organized locations |
| Recovery      | Expensive, slow              | Impossible             | Free, instant       |
| Result feel   | Psychological horror         | Action thriller        | Cozy meditation     |

**Why this example is useful:** It clearly demonstrates that parameters matter as much as mechanics. Same core, opposite experiences through tuning.

**Why it's not foundational:** Only three games, niche audience, recent (2017-2023). Useful as proof of concept, not as the foundation of understanding systems.

**Better grounding:** Civilization shows this across 25 years and millions of players. D\&D shows this across 50 years. These prove the principle at scale.

## Part 5: What Makes Systems Work (And Fail)

### Core Criteria

**1. Purpose Clarity**

Successful systems know what they're optimizing for. This drives every decision.

**D\&D 5e:** Optimizing for accessible heroic fantasy → bounded accuracy (math stays manageable), advantage/disadvantage (simple decision mechanic), backgrounds (narrative identity)

**PbtA games:** Optimizing for genre emulation → moves triggered by fiction (genre-specific), playbooks (genre archetypes), partial success default (genre-typical complications)

**Civilization:** Optimizing for "one more turn" compulsion → feedback loops (growth rewards growth), near-term goals (units finishing soon), long-term planning (victory goals)

**When purpose is unclear:** Results are incoherent. Systems feel like they don't know what they want to be.

**2. Internal Coherence**

Do all components work together toward the same purpose? Or do they work at cross-purposes?

**Coherent:** D\&D 5e - mechanics (d20+mod), parameters (bounded accuracy), context (heroic fantasy), pacing (combat-rest cycles) all reinforce each other

**Incoherent:** D\&D 4e - mechanics said "tactical board game" (powers, grid-mandatory), context said "D\&D RPG" (dragons, dungeons, heroism), resources said "MMO" (healing surges, at-will powers). Players experienced mixed messages.

**3. Appropriate Complexity**

Is complexity justified by purpose? Or is it tedious?

**Too much complexity (justified):** Chess, Go, Magic: The Gathering - complexity enables infinite depth
**Too much complexity (unjustified):** D\&D 3.5e late-game - feat chains, prestige classes, splat books created optimization barriers without serving the core "heroic adventure" purpose

**Too little complexity (justified):** Tic-tac-toe, Rock Paper Scissors - simplicity serves their purpose
**Too little complexity (unjustified):** Simplified game that removed meaningful decisions - now feels hollow

**The insight:** Complexity should scale with decision-making depth, not feature count. More systems ≠ better game.

**4. Feedback and Transparency**

Do players understand cause and effect? Can they learn from failure?

**Clear:** XCOM - "I missed the 90% shot; I'll position better next time" or "I need more armor on this unit"
**Unclear:** Cryptic mechanics - players can't understand why they failed, so they can't improve

**Opaque on purpose:** Cultist Simulator deliberately withholds mechanics (mystery IS the game). Works because it's the intended experience.

**Inadvertently opaque:** System that's just poorly explained or has unintuitive consequences. Players get frustrated.

**5. Meaningful Decisions**

Do choices matter? Are there interesting trade-offs?

**Meaningful:** D\&D 5e - "Do I use my bonus action now or save it for next turn?" or "Do I help the party or pursue my character goal?"
**Meaningful:** Civilization - "Do I rush military (risky but expands borders) or tech (safer but slower)?"
**Meaningful:** Cultist Simulator - "Do I combine these cards hoping for something new, or save them for what I know works?"

**Hollow:** No real choices - one path is obviously optimal, or decisions don't affect outcomes

## Part 6: The Design Process

### Start with Experience, Work Backward

**Step 1: Define Intended Experience**

Not mechanics. Experience.

**Ask:**

* What should players feel? (tension? wonder? competence? fear? flow?)
* What should they want to do? (explore? optimize? create? compete? cooperate?)
* What should they remember? (close calls? discoveries? stories? mastery moments?)

**Step 2: Choose Mechanics to Enable That**

**Not:** "Cards are cool, let's use cards"
**Instead:** "I want discovery → cards hide information until revealed"

**Not:** "2d6 is elegant"
**Instead:** "I want partial success to keep story moving → 2d6 gives 58% probability for 7-9, perfect"

**Step 3: Set Parameters to Tune**

Same mechanic, different parameters = different experience.

**Ask:**

* How scarce should resources be? (extreme vs. abundant)
* How fast should things happen? (constant pressure vs. meditative pacing)
* How dangerous should failure be? (deadly vs. forgiving)
* What board/inventory limits exist? (overwhelming vs. organized)
* How quickly do things recover? (expensive healing vs. instant recovery)

**Step 4: Add Context**

Setting, tone, goal. Not cosmetic—systemic. Context frames what mechanics mean.

**Step 5: Test If Experience Emerges**

Playtest. Ask: Did players actually feel what you intended?

If not: Iterate on steps 2-4. Don't blame players. Adjust system.

## Part 7: How Systems Fail

### The Classic Mistakes

**1. Starting with Mechanics Instead of Experience**

**Symptom:** "I have cool mechanics, what can I do with them?"

**Result:** Mechanics are interesting but serving no purpose. System feels disconnected.

**Example:** Early card game prototypes often had "cool interactions" but no reason to exist.

**Fix:** Start with experience. "I want players to feel X → what mechanics create that?"

**2. Adding Complexity Without Purpose**

**Symptom:** "Let's add a crafting system! And religions! And more resources!"

**Result:** System becomes baroque. Unmotivated complexity becomes tedium.

**Example:** D\&D 3.5e's feat chains. Technically deep, but optimization became burden, not joy.

**Fix:** Every system must serve the core experience. If you can't connect it back, cut it.

**3. Ignoring Parameters**

**Symptom:** Designers focus on mechanics and ignore tuning. "The game feels off but the mechanics are right."

**Result:** Parameters are wrong. Same mechanic, wrong configuration.

**Example:** Resource scarcity too low → nothing threatens you → tension gone. Could be fixed by parameter change, not mechanics redesign.

**Fix:** Before redesigning mechanics, try tuning parameters: scarcity, speed, pressure, limits, recovery.

**4. Treating Context as Cosmetic**

**Symptom:** "We'll add story/flavor later."

**Result:** Context should frame what mechanics mean. Without it, mechanics are abstract, unfelt.

**Example:** Same card game with "researching magic" theme vs. "managing resources" theme feels completely different.

**Fix:** Choose context first. It determines what mechanics mean.

**5. Violating Core Identity**

**Symptom:** Trying to fix problems by changing fundamental nature.

**Result:** You alienate core audience. See D\&D 4e.

**Example:** "Barbarians feel weak compared to spellcasters" → "Let's give everyone powers" → Now barbarians are spellcasters, which isn't what players wanted.

**Fix:** Know what your system IS. Problems should be solved within identity, not by violating it.

**6. No Feedback Loop**

**Symptom:** Players can't understand causality. Why did they lose? What would work better?

**Result:** Frustration. Players can't improve. Retention plummets.

**Example:** Opaque mechanics without explanation. (Exception: Cultist Simulator does this intentionally as discovery mechanic)

**Fix:** Most games need clear feedback. Players should understand cause and effect.

**7. Wrong Investment Level for Audience**

**Symptom:** Designed for exhausted casual players, but demands high-attention play.

**Result:** Burnout. Game is wonderful when rested, miserable when tired.

**Example:** Complex optimization-heavy game presented as relaxing cozy game.

**Fix:** Know your audience's energy state. Design for it. Don't try to serve everyone.

## Part 8: Resources as System Elements

Resources aren't just "what you manage." They're **systemic indicators of what matters.**

**What you track = what matters in the game.**

### Examples

**D\&D:**

* HP (survival pressure)
* Spell slots (tactical decisions for casters)
* Action economy (what you can accomplish per turn)
* Gold/treasure (reward motivation)
* Each resource serves a purpose

**Civilization:**

* Production (what cities build)
* Gold (economic power)
* Science (technological advancement)
* Culture (expansion and victory)
* Faith (religious influence)
* Each resource is a victory path

**PbtA (varies by game):**

* Apocalypse World: Barter (survival economy)
* Monsterhearts: Strings (social leverage)
* Masks: Influence (independence struggle)
* Each resource tells you what game is about

**Key insight:** Don't track things just because they're realistic. Track what creates meaningful decisions.

### Resource Management Over Time

Different games create different pacing through resources:

**D\&D adventuring day:** Multiple encounters deplete resources → rest fully recovers → repeats. Creates "raid economy" pacing.

**Civilization:** City production compounds (more cities → more production → faster growth). Creates "snowball economy" pacing with catch-up mechanics (diplomatic penalties on warmongers, cultural pressure on weak civilizations).

**PbtA:** Resources often immediate (7-9 results are complications, not resource pools). Creates "narrative momentum" pacing.

## Part 9: The Future: What LLMs Change

Large Language Models don't create new design principles, but they enable what was previously impossible:

**What becomes feasible:**

* Emergent narrative (LLM tracks context, generates contextual situations)
* Dynamic difficulty (LLM adjusts based on player performance)
* Natural language mechanics (players describe intent, LLM adjudicates)
* Personalized content (LLM customizes systems to player choices)
* Complex state tracking (LLM maintains intricate world state)

**What must be preserved:**

* Player agency (LLM generates context, players decide)
* Dice rolling ritual (uncertainty, tension)
* Transparency (players understand outcomes)
* Design intent (LLM follows principles, not just generates)

**The trap:** "We can automate everything, so let's automate everything." This kills what makes games work: player agency, meaningful decisions, anticipation.

**The opportunity:** Use LLM to hide complexity, present simple choices. Players experience coherent world without needing to understand the back-end.

## Conclusion: Systems as Purpose

A game system is not its mechanics. It's the **designed interplay of mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing configured to serve a specific intended experience.**

**What we learned from studying actual systems:**

**From D\&D:** Identity matters. Systems survive if they know what they are. Mechanical "improvements" fail if they violate identity.

**From Civilization:** Complexity must be managed. Spatial complexity feels better than numerical. Feedback loops create compulsion. Multiple victory paths create replayability.

**From PbtA:** Simple core mechanics enable more variation. Configuration matters more than mechanics. Same engine can serve opposite genres through reconfiguration.

**From MDA:** Start with aesthetics (experience goal), work backward to mechanics. Not mechanics-first.

**From Ludology:** Simple rules can produce complex emergent behavior. Systems interact in unpredictable ways. Test extensively.

**From Player Types:** Different players want different things. No system serves all equally. Target specific types.

**From Parameter Analysis:** Mechanics are configured, not invented. Same mechanic, different parameters = different experience.

**The Design Process:**

1. Define intended experience (not mechanics)
2. Choose mechanics to enable it
3. Set parameters to tune feel
4. Add context to frame meaning
5. Test if experience emerges
6. Iterate

**The Core Insight:**

Systems that fail start with mechanics and look for uses. Systems that succeed start with experience and build mechanics to serve it.

Purpose before mechanics. Always.

Everything else is details.
