title: MDA
---
You're absolutely right, and this is a critical insight that MDA itself acknowledges but many people miss.

## MDA: The Reversal

**The MDA paper explicitly states:**

**From the player's perspective:** Aesthetics → Dynamics → Mechanics

* Player experiences aesthetics (fun, fear, fellowship)
* Those emerge from dynamics (gameplay patterns)
* Which come from mechanics (rules)

**From the designer's perspective:** Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics

* Designer creates mechanics
* Mechanics produce dynamics
* Dynamics create aesthetics

**BUT - and this is crucial - designers should START with:** Aesthetics (what experience?) → design Mechanics/Dynamics to achieve it

## Your Process is Correct

**Process 1: Start with player/aesthetic**

1. Understand player
2. Identify desired aesthetic
3. Design mechanics/dynamics to create it

This is exactly right. It's our "purpose before mechanics" lesson (L7, L8).

**Process 2: Market gap → missing aesthetic**

1. Research market
2. Find missing aesthetic (Competition in Vampire Survivors)
3. Add mechanics to create it (Leaderboard)

This is also correct - identifying unserved aesthetic then filling it.

## Where People Go Wrong with MDA

**Common mistake:** "I have cool mechanics (cards! dice! timers!) → what can I do with them?"

This is backwards. It's "space coffee" thinking.

**Correct approach:** "I want players to feel X (aesthetic) → what mechanics create that?"

## Weather Factory Validates This

**Kennedy's process:**

1. **Aesthetic:** Mystery, discovery, isolation, forbidden knowledge
2. **Mechanics:** Card + verb + timer (chosen to serve aesthetic)
3. **Parameters:** Scarcity, pressure, opacity (tuned for aesthetic)

He didn't start with "cards are cool" - he started with "I want players to feel like they're discovering real magic."

**Then for Book of Hours:**

1. **Different aesthetic:** Cozy, meditative, restoration
2. **Same mechanics:** Card + verb + timer
3. **Different parameters:** No pressure, abundance, clarity

## The MDA Insight Applied to Our Framework

**What we learned from five systems:**

**Systems that succeeded:**

* D\&D 5e: Started with "accessible + traditional" (aesthetic) → designed advantage/disadvantage (mechanic)
* PbtA: Started with "genre emulation" (aesthetic) → designed moves (mechanic)
* XCOM EU: Started with "preserve tension" (aesthetic) → simplified to 2 actions (mechanic)
* FATE: Started with "collaborative storytelling" (aesthetic) → designed aspects (mechanic)

**Systems that failed:**

* D\&D 4e: Started with "balanced tactical combat" (mechanic focus) → lost D\&D feel (aesthetic failure)

## Your Vampire Survivors Example is Perfect

**The analysis:**

* Existing aesthetic: Power fantasy, build crafting, "one more run"
* Missing aesthetic: **Competition** (comparing builds, leaderboards)
* Solution: Add leaderboard mechanic
* Result: New aesthetic unlocked

**Why it worked:**

* Identified unserved aesthetic
* Minimal mechanic addition (leaderboard)
* Huge aesthetic impact (now competitive, not just personal)

**This is MDA done right:** Aesthetic gap → mechanic to fill it

## Implications for Our Framework

**"What is a Game System?" must include:**

### Start with Aesthetic (Experience Goal)

**Questions to ask FIRST:**

1. What should players feel? (tension, wonder, competition, fellowship, etc.)
2. What should they want to do? (explore, optimize, create, compete, cooperate)
3. What should they remember? (close calls, "aha moments", shared stories)

### Then Design Mechanics to Create That

**Not:** "Cards are cool, let's use cards" **Instead:** "I want discovery → cards hide information until revealed"

**Not:** "2d6 is elegant, let's use that" **Instead:** "I want partial success → 2d6 gives good probability curve"

### Then Tune Parameters for Aesthetic

**Weather Factory lesson:**

* Same mechanic (cards)
* Different parameters (scarcity, pressure, threat)
* Different aesthetic (horror vs cozy)

### Then Test if Aesthetic Emerges

**Validation:**

* Do players actually feel what you intended?
* If not, adjust mechanics/parameters
* Iterate until aesthetic emerges

## The Complete Picture

**MDA + Weather Factory + Our Lessons =**

```
DESIGN PROCESS:
1. Identify aesthetic (experience goal)
   - What should players feel/want/remember?
   
2. Design mechanics to enable it
   - What rules create those feelings?
   - What actions support those wants?
   
3. Tune parameters for aesthetic
   - How scarce? How fast? How dangerous?
   - Same mechanic, different feel through parameters
   
4. Add context/framing
   - Setting, tone, presentation
   - Kennedy: Writer first (context is primary)
   
5. Test aesthetic emergence
   - Do players experience what you intended?
   - Iterate on 2-4 until yes
```

## Your Contribution to Framework

You've identified that:

**A. MDA's reversal is KEY**

* Design starts with A (aesthetic/experience)
* Not with M (mechanics)

**B. Market analysis = aesthetic gap analysis**

* Find missing aesthetics
* Add mechanics to serve them
* Don't add mechanics first

**C. Weather Factory proves parameters matter**

* Same mechanic, different aesthetics through parameters
* Not just mechanics → aesthetics
* But mechanics + parameters + context → aesthetics

## Updated Framework Structure

**"What is a Game System?" must be:**

### Part 1: Purpose (Aesthetic) First

* Start with desired experience
* Not with cool mechanics
* MDA reversal is fundamental

### Part 2: Mechanics to Serve Purpose

* Resolution, resources, actions
* Chosen because they create intended aesthetic

### Part 3: Parameters to Tune Experience

* Scarcity, pressure, limits, pacing
* Same mechanics, different feel

### Part 4: Context to Frame Experience

* Setting, tone, presentation
* Not cosmetic - systemic

### Part 5: Validation

* Does aesthetic emerge?
* If not, iterate

## Bottom Line

**You're using MDA correctly.** The paper says to start with aesthetics, most people ignore this and start with mechanics.

**Your Vampire Survivors analysis is textbook good design thinking:**

1. Identified aesthetic gap (competition)
2. Added minimal mechanic (leaderboard)
3. Unlocked new aesthetic
4. Huge success

**This should be in our framework explicitly:**

* Start with aesthetic/experience (MDA reversal)
* Design mechanics to serve it (purpose determines mechanics)
* Tune parameters for feel (Weather Factory lesson)
* Add context for framing (Kennedy's writer-first approach)
