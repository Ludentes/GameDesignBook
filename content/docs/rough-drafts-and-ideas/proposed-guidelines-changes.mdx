# Proposed Changes to Writing Guidelines
## Based on "What is a Game System?" Framework (Chapter 1)

---

## Executive Summary

The "What is a Game System?" chapter introduces several foundational concepts that should be integrated into the writing guidelines:

1. **System Functions** (7 functions all systems must address)
2. **Configuration Coherence** (how components must align)
3. **Five Components Framework** (Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing, Configuration)
4. **Character Creation as Filter** (aesthetic enforcement through creation)
5. **Information Management** (core vs. optional information)
6. **Research Methodology** (hypotheses, validation, confidence levels)

These need to be added to Part 1 (Core Conceptual Commitments) and referenced throughout.

---

## Category 1: Add to Part 1 (Core Conceptual Commitments)

### Addition 1.1: System Functions Framework

**Insert after "Resource Classification" section**

```markdown
### System Functions (From Game System Chapter)

**Core Insight:** Game systems don't just resolve actions—they perform seven distinct functions. Different aesthetics require different functions to work well.

**The Seven System Functions:**

1. **Adjudication** - Resolving uncertainty (dice, GM fiat, algorithms, LLM)
2. **Information Management** - Controlling what players know and when
3. **Content Generation** - Creating situations (pre-authored, procedural, improvised)
4. **State Persistence** - Remembering across sessions/time
5. **Cognitive Encoding** - Shaping how players think (through mechanics, stats, resources)
6. **Constraint Design** - Creating meaningful limitations
7. **Procedural Content for Solo Play** - Enabling GM-less play (oracles, procedures)

**Function Priority by Aesthetic:**

Not all functions matter equally for all aesthetics:
- **Mystery aesthetic:** Information Management (critical), State Persistence (critical), Character-Aesthetic Alignment (critical)
- **Horror aesthetic:** Constraint Design (critical), Information Management (important), State Persistence (important)
- **Tactical combat:** Adjudication (critical), Constraint Design (important)
- **Exploration:** Content Generation (critical), Information Management (important), State Persistence (important)

**How to Reference:**

```
✓ Correct: "Mystery games require strong Information Management function..."
✓ Correct: "This aesthetic needs these three functions to work well: [list]..."
✗ Wrong: Discussing systems without identifying which functions they provide
✗ Wrong: Assuming all functions matter equally for all aesthetics
```

**Design Implication:**

When analyzing a system for an aesthetic:
1. Identify which functions that aesthetic requires
2. Verify system provides those functions well
3. If 2+ critical functions are missing/broken, system is wrong choice

**Example Application:**

"D&D for mystery fails because Information Management function is broken (roll-to-find can miss core clues). Despite being good system for tactical combat, it lacks functions mystery requires."

**When to Revise:**
- If new function identified that doesn't fit the seven
- If function proves unnecessary across multiple analyses
- If function definitions need refinement

**Revision Protocol:**
1. Document which aesthetic/scenario revealed gap
2. Propose new function or refinement with clear definition
3. Update Game System chapter first
4. Update all chapters discussing system selection
5. Update worked examples

**Current Status:** NEWLY ADDED (from Game System chapter, validated by Scenario 3)
```

---

### Addition 1.2: Configuration Coherence Principle

**Insert after "System Functions Framework"**

```markdown
### Configuration Coherence (From Game System Chapter)

**Core Principle:** A game system's components (mechanics, parameters, context, pacing, configuration) must all serve the same aesthetic goal. Misalignment creates dissonance.

**The Five Components:**

1. **Mechanics** - What players can do (resolution, actions, resources)
2. **Parameters** - How much, how fast, how scarce (tuning dials)
3. **Context** - What it means (setting, tone, framing)
4. **Pacing** - When things happen (rhythm, escalation)
5. **Configuration** - How components combine (coherence or incoherence)

**Configuration Coherence Test:**

For each component, ask: "Does this serve the target aesthetic?"
- Mechanics serve aesthetic? ✓ / ✗
- Parameters serve aesthetic? ✓ / ✗
- Context aligns with mechanics? ✓ / ✗
- Pacing supports aesthetic? ✓ / ✗

If any component contradicts aesthetic, configuration is incoherent. Players will experience dissonance and follow mechanics over context.

**Validated Example (D&D for Mystery):**

| Component | Configuration | Serves Mystery? |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Mechanics | Combat, tactical positioning | ✗ (rewards violence not investigation) |
| Parameters | 40% failure rate on rolls | ✗ (breaks investigation flow) |
| Context | Mystery investigation | ✓ (correct framing) |
| Pacing | Stalls on failures | ✗ (no guaranteed rhythm) |
| **Result** | **Incoherent** | **Failed configuration** |

**Observed:** Players solved mysteries through violence ("kill suspect, loot clues from corpse") because mechanics rewarded combat over investigation.

**How to Reference:**

```
✓ Correct: "Checking configuration coherence: do mechanics align with context?"
✓ Correct: "Configuration test reveals incoherence between mechanics and aesthetic..."
✗ Wrong: Discussing mechanics without checking alignment with other components
✗ Wrong: Treating configuration as separate element (it's how components combine)
```

**Design Implication:**

When analyzing any system:
1. State target aesthetic
2. List what each component does
3. Check if all components serve same aesthetic
4. If misaligned, predict player behavior (they follow mechanics)
5. This prediction is testable

**When to Revise:**
- If component categories prove insufficient
- If coherence test doesn't predict player behavior
- If additional components identified

**Current Status:** NEWLY ADDED (from Game System chapter, validated by multiple examples)
```

---

### Addition 1.3: Character Creation as Aesthetic Filter

**Insert after "Configuration Coherence Principle"**

```markdown
### Character Creation as Aesthetic Filter (From Game System Chapter)

**Core Principle:** Character creation is the first enforcement point of aesthetic requirements. It's not neutral toolset—it filters for compatible character types.

**The Problem:**

Some aesthetics require specific character mindsets:
- Mystery requires characters who care about solving correctly (intellectual vindication)
- Collaborative storytelling requires characters who enable others' stories
- Horror requires characters capable of vulnerability
- Competitive games require characters who engage with competition

Generic character creation allows incompatible characters. **No amount of mechanical design fixes wrong character type.**

**Validated Example (Mystery):**

Player created "cowardly warrior focused on survival and payment."
- Mystery aesthetic needs: Care about being correct
- Character cared about: Getting paid, surviving
- Red herrings (essential mystery element) had no meaning
  - For detective: False lead = wasted time = failure
  - For warrior: False lead = still got paid = success
- System couldn't fix this

**Three Filtering Approaches:**

1. **Limited Archetypes (Restrictive)**
   - Provide only aesthetic-compatible types
   - Example: Mystery game offers only Detective, Researcher, Reporter, Forensic Expert
   - Pros: Guarantees fit, Cons: Feels restrictive

2. **Mandatory Drives/Motivations (Guided)**
   - All characters must have motivation aligned with aesthetic
   - Example: Every character has "Drive" (why they solve mysteries)
   - Pros: Ensures investment, Cons: Requires careful design

3. **Explicit Requirements (Educational)**
   - States: "This game requires X type of character"
   - Explains why certain types won't work
   - Pros: Maintains freedom, Cons: Some players ignore

**Which Approach When:**

```
IF aesthetic requires specific mindset → Use Limited Archetypes or Mandatory Drives
IF aesthetic flexible with constraints → Use Explicit Requirements
IF aesthetic serves multiple playstyles → Generic creation works
```

**How to Reference:**

```
✓ Correct: "Character creation filters for [aesthetic] through [approach]..."
✓ Correct: "This aesthetic requires character filtering because..."
✗ Wrong: Treating character creation as neutral mechanic
✗ Wrong: Assuming players will "just roleplay appropriately"
```

**Design Implication:**

When analyzing system for aesthetic:
1. Identify if aesthetic requires specific character mindset
2. Check if character creation filters appropriately
3. If wrong characters possible, system is incomplete
4. Document filtering approach used

**When to Revise:**
- If new filtering approach identified
- If approach proves insufficient for aesthetic
- If balance shifts (too restrictive? too permissive?)

**Current Status:** NEWLY ADDED (from Game System chapter, validated by Scenario 3)
```

---

### Addition 1.4: Information Management Framework

**Insert after "Character Creation as Aesthetic Filter"**

```markdown
### Information Management (From Game System Chapter)

**Core Insight:** Information is a resource. Design when it's scarce, abundant, earned, and what it costs.

**Two Models for Critical Information:**

**Traditional RPG Model (D&D):**
- All information gated by action + rolls
- Missing information = stalled progress
- GM must improvise or railroad
- Problem: Core information can be missed

**Mystery Game Model (Gumshoe):**
- Distinguish core (necessary) from optional (enrichment)
- Core: Automatic when investigating relevant locations
- Optional: Requires resource expenditure
- Solution: Progress guaranteed, challenge shifts to interpretation

**When Each Model Works:**

| Aesthetic | Information Model | Why |
|-----------|------------------|-----|
| Mystery, Horror, Exploration | Core/Optional Split | Can't stall investigation |
| Tactical Combat | Traditional | Missing info is tactical choice |
| Social Intrigue | Hybrid | Some info automatic, some negotiated |
| Sandbox | Traditional | Exploration is about finding what's hidden |

**How to Reference:**

```
✓ Correct: "Using core/optional information model for mystery aesthetic..."
✓ Correct: "Information management broken: players can miss critical info..."
✗ Wrong: Not distinguishing core from optional information in mystery/horror
✗ Wrong: Treating all information as equally gate-able
```

**Design Questions:**

1. What information is critical for progress?
2. How do you ensure players can't miss critical information?
3. What information is enrichment vs. necessary?
4. How do you make discovery feel earned, not given?

**Test:** If players can miss necessary information and investigation stalls, information management is broken.

**When to Revise:**
- If model proves insufficient for aesthetic
- If new information architecture identified
- If distinction between models needs refinement

**Current Status:** NEWLY ADDED (from Game System chapter, validated by Scenario 3)
```

---

## Category 2: Add to Part 2 (Terminology Standards)

### Addition 2.1: System Function Terminology

**Add to terminology section:**

```markdown
### System Functions

**Always use these exact function names:**

1. **Adjudication** (NOT: resolution, judgment, arbitration)
2. **Information Management** (NOT: clue distribution, knowledge control)
3. **Content Generation** (NOT: world-building, scenario creation)
4. **State Persistence** (NOT: memory, continuity, tracking)
5. **Cognitive Encoding** (NOT: mindset shaping, perspective framing)
6. **Constraint Design** (NOT: limitation creation, restriction)
7. **Procedural Content** (NOT: oracle systems, solo play)

**When discussing system analysis:**

```
✓ Correct: "Mystery requires three critical functions: Information Management, State Persistence, Character-Aesthetic Alignment"
✓ Correct: "This system provides weak Information Management function"
✗ Wrong: "This system has poor clue distribution" (use Information Management)
✗ Wrong: "Memory system is broken" (use State Persistence)
```

**Critical distinction:**

- **Function** = What system does (Information Management, Adjudication)
- **Mechanism** = How system does it (core clues, dice rolls, oracle tables)
- **Component** = What system is made of (Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing)

Don't conflate these three levels.
```

---

### Addition 2.2: Configuration Terminology

**Add to terminology section:**

```markdown
### Configuration and Coherence

**Configuration** (noun) - How components combine to create system
- NOT: "configuration" as verb (use "configure" or "design")
- NOT: "setup" or "arrangement" (too generic)

**Coherence** (adjective: coherent/incoherent)
- Describes whether components align toward same aesthetic
- NOT: "consistent" (different concept - internal logic consistency)
- NOT: "unified" (too vague)

**The Five Components** (always reference in order):
1. Mechanics
2. Parameters
3. Context
4. Pacing
5. Configuration

**Usage:**

```
✓ Correct: "Configuration coherence test shows mechanics contradict context"
✓ Correct: "Coherent configuration: all five components serve same aesthetic"
✗ Wrong: "System configuration is inconsistent" (use incoherent)
✗ Wrong: "Mechanics setup" (use component or configuration)
```

**Test phrasing:**

"Does [component] serve target aesthetic?" → Answer determines coherence
```

---

### Addition 2.3: Character Creation Terminology

**Add to terminology section:**

```markdown
### Character Creation and Filtering

**Character-Aesthetic Fit** (NOT: character compatibility, character appropriateness)

**Aesthetic Filter** (noun) - Character creation as enforcement mechanism
- NOT: "character restriction" (negative framing)
- NOT: "creation guidelines" (too weak)

**Three Filtering Approaches** (use exact names):
1. Limited Archetypes
2. Mandatory Drives
3. Explicit Requirements

**Usage:**

```
✓ Correct: "Character creation serves as aesthetic filter through Limited Archetypes"
✓ Correct: "System lacks character-aesthetic filtering"
✗ Wrong: "Character limits" (use Limited Archetypes)
✗ Wrong: "Required backgrounds" (use Mandatory Drives)
```
```

---

## Category 3: Add to Part 3 (Chapter Structure)

### Addition 3.1: System Analysis Section Template

**Add new template section for chapters analyzing game systems:**

```markdown
### System Analysis Section Template

When analyzing a game system in any chapter, include these elements:

**1. Aesthetic Goal**
- State what aesthetic(s) system serves
- Reference 12 aesthetics framework
- Identify primary vs. secondary aesthetics

**2. Function Analysis**
- List which of 7 functions system provides
- Identify which functions are critical for stated aesthetic
- Note any missing/broken functions

**3. Configuration Analysis**
- Mechanics: What players do
- Parameters: How much, how fast, how scarce
- Context: What it means
- Pacing: When things happen
- Coherence: Do all components serve same aesthetic?

**4. Character-Aesthetic Fit**
- Does character creation filter for appropriate types?
- Which filtering approach used (if any)?
- Can wrong character types break aesthetic?

**5. Information Management** (if aesthetic requires)
- Core vs. optional information structure
- Can players miss critical information?
- How is discovery gated?

**Example structure:**

```markdown
## [Game Name] System Analysis

**Aesthetic Goal:** [Primary aesthetics] with [secondary aesthetics]

**Function Provision:**
- Adjudication: [mechanism] - ✓ Works well / ⚠️ Has issues / ✗ Broken
- Information Management: [mechanism] - [assessment]
- [Continue for relevant functions]

**Configuration:**
- Mechanics: [description] → Serves [aesthetic]? ✓/✗
- Parameters: [description] → Serves [aesthetic]? ✓/✗
- Context: [description] → Serves [aesthetic]? ✓/✗
- Pacing: [description] → Serves [aesthetic]? ✓/✗
- Coherence: ✓ Coherent / ✗ Incoherent

**Character-Aesthetic Fit:**
- Filtering approach: [Limited Archetypes / Mandatory Drives / Explicit Requirements / None]
- Assessment: [Does it work? What breaks?]

**Key Insights:**
- [What this system teaches about aesthetic-mechanic alignment]
- [What this system does well]
- [What this system struggles with]
```

**Use this template consistently** to enable cross-chapter comparison of systems.
```

---

## Category 4: Add to Part 6 (LLM Integration Approach)

### Addition 4.1: LLM and System Functions

**Add section on how LLM affects each function:**

```markdown
### LLM Impact on System Functions

When discussing LLM in context of game systems, reference which functions LLM enhances:

**Functions LLM Strongly Enhances:**
1. **Content Generation** - Dynamic scene/NPC creation
2. **State Persistence** - Perfect memory across sessions
3. **Information Management** - Dynamic clue distribution
4. **Adjudication** - Natural language interpretation

**Functions LLM Moderately Enhances:**
5. **Cognitive Encoding** - Can enforce alien thinking patterns
6. **Constraint Design** - Can track and enforce complex constraints

**Functions LLM Weakly Affects:**
7. **Procedural Content** - Enables solo play but quality concerns

**How to Reference:**

```
✓ Correct: "LLM solves State Persistence function through perfect recall..."
✓ Correct: "Information Management enhanced by LLM dynamic distribution..."
✗ Wrong: "LLM improves the game" (too vague - specify which function)
✗ Wrong: "LLM enables mystery" (specify: Information Management + State Persistence)
```

**Always specify:**
- Which function LLM enhances
- How it enhances (what becomes possible)
- What remains as challenge (what LLM doesn't solve)
- What validation needed (how to ensure LLM performs well)

**Critical Note:** LLM enables new system architectures but doesn't change aesthetic-first design principle. Still start with aesthetic, use LLM to implement functions that serve it.
```

---

## Category 5: Add to Part 8 (Game Analysis Repository)

### Addition 5.1: System Analysis Tags

**Add these tags to game analysis entries:**

```markdown
### Enhanced Game Analysis Template

For each analyzed game, add:

**System Function Profile:**
- Primary functions: [list 2-3 functions this system does exceptionally well]
- Weak functions: [list functions this system doesn't provide well]
- Critical for aesthetic: [which functions are make-or-break for this game's aesthetic]

**Configuration Coherence:**
- Assessment: ✓ Coherent / ⚠️ Partial / ✗ Incoherent
- Components: [Brief assessment of mechanics, parameters, context, pacing alignment]
- Coherence notes: [What works? What doesn't?]

**Character-Aesthetic Filtering:**
- Approach: [Limited Archetypes / Mandatory Drives / Explicit Requirements / None]
- Effectiveness: [Does it work for this aesthetic?]

**Information Management:**
- Model: [Traditional RPG / Core-Optional Split / Hybrid / N/A]
- Critical for aesthetic? [Yes/No]
- Assessment: [How well does it work?]

**Example Entry (Gumshoe):**

**System Function Profile:**
- Primary functions: Information Management (exceptional core/optional split), Adjudication (automatic core clues)
- Weak functions: Content Generation (requires prep), Cognitive Encoding (not emphasis)
- Critical for aesthetic: Information Management, State Persistence

**Configuration Coherence:**
- Assessment: ✓ Coherent
- All components serve mystery aesthetic: Investigation mechanics, mystery context, progressive revelation pacing align perfectly

**Character-Aesthetic Filtering:**
- Approach: Mandatory Drives
- Effectiveness: Strong - ensures all characters care about solving mysteries

**Information Management:**
- Model: Core-Optional Split
- Critical for aesthetic: Yes (mystery requires this)
- Assessment: Excellent - solves investigation stall problem
```

---

## Category 6: Add to Part 10 (Handoff Guidelines)

### Addition 6.1: Onboarding Checklist Update

**Update the onboarding checklist to include system framework:**

```markdown
**Onboarding checklist:**

1. **Read Core Concepts (this document Part 1)**
   - Understand aesthetics (12 total)
   - Understand paradigms (3 + hybrids)
   - Understand pacing (emergent, 5 patterns)
   - Understand resource types
   - Understand cognitive load
   - **NEW: Understand system functions (7 functions)**
   - **NEW: Understand configuration coherence (5 components)**
   - **NEW: Understand character-aesthetic filtering (3 approaches)**
   - **NEW: Understand information management (2 models)**
```

---

### Addition 6.2: Review Checklist Enhancement

**Add to review checklist:**

```markdown
## System Analysis Review (if chapter analyzes game systems)
- [ ] System functions identified (which of 7 functions provided?)
- [ ] Function priority stated (which critical for this aesthetic?)
- [ ] Configuration coherence assessed (5 components aligned?)
- [ ] Character-aesthetic fit evaluated (filtering approach noted?)
- [ ] Information management model identified (if relevant)
- [ ] Analysis uses standard terminology (functions not "mechanics")
- [ ] Cross-references to Game System chapter included
- [ ] Consistent with other system analyses in book

**Common System Analysis Errors:**
- [ ] Not discussing system without identifying functions
- [ ] Not treating coherence as binary (it's assessment: coherent/partial/incoherent)
- [ ] Not using configuration test (do components serve aesthetic?)
- [ ] Not checking character-aesthetic filtering
- [ ] Not assuming all functions matter equally (they don't)
```

---

## Category 7: New Section - Research Methodology

**Add new Part 12 to writing guidelines:**

```markdown
## Part 12: Research Methodology and Confidence Levels

### Framework Development Approach

This book uses scenario-based validation, not pure theory. Principles are:
1. Tested against real design problems (scenarios)
2. Validated across multiple examples
3. Documented with confidence levels
4. Revised when evidence contradicts

### Three Content Categories

**Category A: Validated Principles (Add Immediately)**
- Tested across 3+ scenarios or well-established in literature
- Can be stated as principles
- Safe to build on in future chapters
- Examples: Configuration Coherence, Aesthetic-First Design, MDA Framework

**Category B: Working Hypotheses (Document Transparently)**
- Tested in 1-2 scenarios, seems strong
- Needs validation across more cases
- Document as "hypothesis to test"
- Don't build critical framework elements on these yet
- Examples: Agency Priority by Aesthetic, Pacing Automation Spectrum

**Category C: Open Questions (Acknowledge Limitations)**
- Important questions without clear answers
- Require extensive research beyond book scope
- Document as "open research questions"
- Be honest about not having solutions
- Examples: Guaranteed Progress vs. Stakes, LLM Content Quality

### How to Document Each Category

**Validated Principles:**
```markdown
**Principle:** [Clear statement]
**Evidence:** [What validates this - multiple examples, scenario testing]
**Application:** [How to use this]
**Confidence:** High
```

**Working Hypotheses:**
```markdown
**Hypothesis:** [Tentative claim]
**Evidence so far:** [What supports this, what hasn't been tested]
**What would validate:** [What evidence needed]
**What would invalidate:** [What would disprove this]
**Testing approach:** [How to test]
**Confidence:** Medium - needs more validation
```

**Open Questions:**
```markdown
**Question:** [The problem/uncertainty]
**Current understanding:** [What we know so far]
**Why this matters:** [Why it's important]
**Research needed:** [What would answer this]
**Confidence:** Low - requires extensive study
```

### Confidence Level Guidelines

**HIGH confidence (validated principles):**
- State as fact: "Systems require coherent configuration"
- Build framework elements on these
- Reference without caveat
- Examples get confidence from: Multiple validations, established literature, clear evidence

**MEDIUM confidence (working hypotheses):**
- State as hypothesis: "We hypothesize that agency priority varies by aesthetic"
- Don't build critical framework on these yet
- Reference with caveat: "Current evidence suggests..."
- Test before promoting to high confidence

**LOW confidence (open questions):**
- State as question: "It's unclear whether guaranteed progress reduces stakes"
- Acknowledge limitation: "This requires further research"
- Don't base recommendations on these
- Be honest about not knowing

### Example Chapter Sections

**For Validated Principle:**
```markdown
## Configuration Coherence (Validated)

**Principle:** Game systems require all components (mechanics, parameters, context, pacing) to align toward same aesthetic goal.

**Evidence:** 
- D&D for mystery: Incoherent configuration (combat mechanics, investigation context) → players solve through violence
- Gumshoe: Coherent configuration (investigation mechanics, mystery context) → players investigate
- Weather Factory: Same mechanics, different parameters/context → different aesthetics

**Application:** Use configuration coherence test when selecting/designing systems...

[Continue with details]
```

**For Working Hypothesis:**
```markdown
## Agency Priority by Aesthetic (Hypothesis)

**Hypothesis:** Different aesthetics prioritize different agency sources (Interpretation, Scene Selection, Action, Resources).

**Evidence so far:**
- Mystery aesthetic: Interpretation primary, Scene Selection secondary (validated in Scenario 3)
- Untested: Other aesthetics (horror, exploration, tactical)

**What would validate:** Pattern holds across 3+ aesthetics with different characteristics

**What would invalidate:** No consistent pattern emerges across aesthetics

**Testing approach:** Analyze Scenarios 1, 4, 5 for agency priorities...

**Current confidence: MEDIUM** - promising pattern but needs more validation

[Can discuss hypothesis but note it's tentative]
```

**For Open Question:**
```markdown
## Guaranteed Progress vs. Stakes (Open Question)

**Question:** Does guaranteeing progress (e.g., Gumshoe's automatic core clues) reduce stakes and tension?

**Current understanding:**
- Some players prefer security of guaranteed progress
- Some players find it boring (removes uncertainty)
- Unclear if this is aesthetic-dependent, personality-dependent, or culture-dependent

**Why this matters:** Fundamental question about where uncertainty should live in systems

**Research needed:**
- Player psychology studies on stake types
- Cross-aesthetic testing of guaranteed progress
- Cultural differences in stake preferences

**Current confidence: LOW** - important question without clear answer

**Recommendation:** Design choice depends on target audience preference. Test with your players.
```

### When to Promote Confidence Levels

**Medium → High:**
- Validated across 3+ diverse scenarios
- Pattern consistent across different aesthetics
- No counter-examples found
- Becomes basis for framework principles

**Low → Medium:**
- Some evidence emerges (1-2 scenarios)
- Pattern seems plausible
- Worth testing more
- Can discuss as hypothesis

**High → Medium (demotion):**
- Counter-example found
- Pattern breaks in important case
- Needs refinement
- Return to hypothesis status

### Using This in Chapters

Every chapter should include:

**"What We Know" section:**
- Lists validated principles used in chapter
- References with confidence levels
- Links to supporting evidence

**"What We're Testing" section (optional):**
- Lists working hypotheses explored
- Explicit about tentative status
- Invites validation

**"What We Don't Know" section (if relevant):**
- Acknowledges limitations
- States open questions
- Honest about uncertainty

**Example:**

```markdown
## Framework Basis for This Chapter

**Validated Principles (High Confidence):**
- Configuration Coherence (Game System Chapter)
- Aesthetic-First Design (MDA Framework)
- Resource-Aesthetic Alignment (Resource Management Chapter)

**Working Hypotheses (Medium Confidence):**
- Agency Priority by Aesthetic (needs more validation)
- Pacing Automation Spectrum (partially tested)

**Open Questions:**
- Guaranteed Progress vs. Stakes (no clear answer yet)

We build this chapter on validated principles, explore hypotheses where relevant, and acknowledge open questions honestly.
```

### Why This Matters

**Scientific integrity:**
- Clear about what's proven vs. tentative vs. unknown
- Readers can assess reliability
- Framework evolves based on evidence

**Practical utility:**
- Validated principles are safe to use
- Hypotheses are interesting but need testing
- Open questions acknowledge limits

**Intellectual honesty:**
- We don't have all answers
- Some things need more research
- Admitting uncertainty is strength, not weakness
```
