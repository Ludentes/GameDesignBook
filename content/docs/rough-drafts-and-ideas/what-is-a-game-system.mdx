# What is a Game System?

## Introduction: Beyond "The Rules"

A game system is not simply "the rules." It's not a resolution mechanic (d20, 2d6, cards). It's not a collection of subsystems bolted together.

**A game system is a designed configuration of mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing that creates a specific experience through player interaction.**

This definition emerged from analyzing five game system evolutions (D\&D, Powered by the Apocalypse, Civilization, XCOM, FATE) plus Weather Factory's radical experiments (Cultist Simulator, Exile, Book of Hours). Each revealed different aspects of what makes a system work - or fail.

## The Core Insight: Purpose Before Mechanics

**The most important lesson across all systems:**

Systems that succeed start with the intended experience (aesthetic) and design mechanics to serve it. Systems that fail start with cool mechanics and try to find a use for them.

This is the MDA framework's reversal:

* **Players experience:** Aesthetics → Dynamics → Mechanics
* **Designers create:** Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics
* **But designers should START with:** Aesthetics (what experience?) → then design Mechanics/Dynamics to achieve it

### Examples of Getting This Right

**D\&D 5e:**

* Aesthetic: Accessible + traditional D\&D feel
* Mechanic: Advantage/disadvantage (elegant, no modifier stacking)
* Result: Best-selling D\&D edition

**Powered by the Apocalypse:**

* Aesthetic: Genre-specific experiences (teen drama, heist thriller, etc.)
* Mechanic: Fiction-first moves that encode genre
* Result: Infinite variety from simple core

**Weather Factory (Book of Hours):**

* Aesthetic: Cozy, meditative library restoration
* Mechanic: Same card+verb+timer as Cultist Simulator
* Parameters: No pressure, no threats, abundant time
* Result: Completely different feeling from same mechanics

### Examples of Getting This Wrong

**D\&D 4e:**

* Started with: Balanced tactical combat (mechanic focus)
* Lost: D\&D's identity and feel
* Result: Commercial failure, fans forked to Pathfinder

**Lesson:** You can't just "fix problems" (4e was technically superior). You must preserve what makes the experience meaningful.

## The Five Components of a Game System

A game system consists of five interlocking components. Change any one, you change the experience.

### 1. Mechanics (What You Can Do)

**Definition:** The rules governing player actions and resolutions.

**Components:**

* **Resolution mechanics:** How outcomes are determined (dice, cards, timers, algorithms)
* **Action space:** What players can choose to do
* **Resource tracking:** What gets measured and how

**Examples:**

* D\&D: d20 + modifier vs DC (resolution), classes define actions, track HP/spells
* PbtA: 2d6 + stat, 10+/7-9/6- tiers (resolution), moves define actions, track harm/stress
* Cultist Simulator: Card + verb + timer (resolution), six verbs define actions, track everything as cards
* XCOM: 2 actions per turn (resolution), class abilities define options, track HP/will/ammo

**Key insight from evolution:**

* Simple core mechanics enable complex applications (PbtA's 2d6, XCOM's 2 actions)
* Unified mechanics feel coherent (D\&D 3e's d20 for everything)
* Mechanics should fade into background, not demand constant attention

**From Weather Factory:**
The same mechanic (card+verb+timer) can serve radically different purposes through different configurations.

### 2. Parameters (How Much, How Fast, How Scarce)

**Definition:** The numerical and constraint settings that determine feel and pacing.

**Components:**

* **Scarcity levels:** How abundant or limited are resources?
* **Speed/timing:** How fast do things happen? How long do timers run?
* **Limits:** How much can you carry? How many actions? How big can your board get?
* **Threat levels:** How dangerous is failure? How permanent are consequences?
* **Recovery rates:** How quickly do resources replenish?

**Examples - Same Mechanic, Different Parameters:**

**Cultist Simulator (Horror):**

* Scarcity: Everything scarce, drowning in unusable cards
* Speed: 60-second timers with constant Time Passes drain
* Limit: Unlimited board (overwhelm as mechanic)
* Threat: Death constantly imminent (Dread, Fascination, Starvation)
* Recovery: Minimal, expensive

**Book of Hours (Cozy):**

* Scarcity: Resources abundant, gentle acquisition
* Speed: Same 60-second timers but no pressure
* Limit: Organized, not overwhelming
* Threat: Practically none
* Recovery: Generous, forgiving

**Same mechanics, completely different experiences through parameter changes.**

**Other examples:**

* XCOM: Original (14 soldiers, deadly) vs EU (4-6 soldiers, each matters more)
* D\&D: 4e (high HP, hard to die) vs 5e (lower HP, deadlier)
* Civ: IV (complex, many systems) vs V (streamlined) vs VI (smart complexity)

**Key insight:**
Parameters matter as much as mechanics. You can achieve variety through tuning without inventing new mechanics.

### 3. Context (What It Means)

**Definition:** The framing, setting, tone, and thematic elements that give mechanics meaning.

**Components:**

* **Setting/fiction:** Where does this take place? What's the story?
* **Tone/aesthetics:** Horror, cozy, heroic, gritty, comedic?
* **Goals/victory conditions:** What are you trying to achieve?
* **Thematic framing:** What does this represent? What's it about?

**From Weather Factory - Context IS System:**

Kennedy (writer first, designer second) proves context isn't "just skin":

* Horror context + card crafting = horror experience
* Cozy context + same mechanics = cozy experience
* Context transforms how mechanics feel

**Other examples:**

* PbtA: Monsterhearts (teen drama) vs Dungeon World (heroic fantasy) - same 2d6 engine, completely different through moves and tone
* FATE: Dresden Files (urban fantasy mystery) vs Spirit of the Century (pulp action) - same aspects system, different through setting
* D\&D: Same rules feel different in gothic horror vs high fantasy vs gritty realism

**Key insight:**
Context is systemic, not cosmetic. It shapes how players interpret mechanics and what choices feel meaningful.

### 4. Pacing (When Things Happen)

**Definition:** The rhythm, timing, and flow of gameplay.

**Components:**

* **Time structure:** Real-time, turn-based, hybrid?
* **Pressure curves:** When is there urgency? When is there breathing room?
* **Escalation:** How does tension build?
* **Rhythm:** What's the beat of play? (Combat-rest-combat, or constant pressure, or meditative flow?)

**Examples:**

**XCOM 2 timed missions:**

* Same mechanics as Enemy Unknown
* Added turn limits
* Created aggressive playstyle (vs defensive overwatch crawl)
* Controversial but effective at changing pacing

**Cultist Simulator vs Book of Hours:**

* Same 60-second timers
* Cultist: Timers create pressure (Time Passes kills you)
* Book of Hours: Timers just show progress (no death threat)
* Same mechanic, different meaning through threat context

**D\&D rest cycles:**

* Short rest (1 hour) vs Long rest (8 hours)
* Creates rhythm: Combat → resources depleted → rest → combat
* 4e vs 5e differences in what recovers when = different pacing

**Civ's "one more turn":**

* Short-term goals constantly completing (2-3 turns)
* Long-term planning (50+ turns)
* Creates compulsion through layered pacing

**Key insight:**
Pacing transforms how mechanics feel. Same resolution mechanic can create urgency or meditation depending on when and why you use it.

### 5. Configuration (How It All Combines)

**Definition:** The way mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing integrate to create coherent experience.

**This is where "system" emerges from "mechanics":**

A pile of mechanics isn't a system. A system is when the components work together to consistently create an intended experience.

**Good configuration (coherent):**

* Every component serves the same aesthetic goal
* Mechanics, parameters, context, pacing all aligned
* Players intuitively understand what the game wants them to do
* Feels unified, not bolted-together

**Bad configuration (incoherent):**

* Components working at cross-purposes
* Mechanics say one thing, context says another
* Players confused about what matters
* Feels like different games stapled together

**Examples:**

**D\&D 5e (Good configuration):**

* Aesthetic: Accessible heroic fantasy
* Mechanics: Simple core (d20+mod), complex application
* Parameters: Bounded accuracy (math stays manageable)
* Context: Medieval fantasy, heroic tone
* Pacing: Combat-rest cycles, episodic adventures
* **Result:** Everything reinforces "accessible traditional D\&D"

**D\&D 4e (Poor configuration):**

* Aesthetic goal: Balanced tactical combat
* Mechanics: Powers for everyone (MMO-like)
* Parameters: High HP, lots of healing
* Context: D\&D branding (medieval fantasy)
* Pacing: Grid-mandatory tactical encounters
* **Problem:** Mechanics and parameters said "tactical board game" but context said "D\&D RPG" - conflicting messages

**Weather Factory (Masterful configuration):**

Same mechanics (card+verb+timer) configured three ways:

**Cultist Simulator:**

* Parameters: Scarce, high pressure, unlimited board
* Context: Occult horror, isolation
* Pacing: Constant time pressure
* **Configuration creates:** Desperate, overwhelming horror

**Exile:**

* Parameters: Extremely scarce, high pressure, tiny inventory
* Context: Hunted refugee, survival
* Pacing: Discovery = must flee immediately
* **Configuration creates:** Tense action thriller

**Book of Hours:**

* Parameters: Abundant, no pressure, organized
* Context: Cozy library restoration
* Pacing: Meditative, self-directed
* **Configuration creates:** Relaxing pastoral

**Key insight:**
Configuration is the art of game design. Choosing components is craft; combining them coherently is art.

## What Makes a System Good?

### Universal Criteria (Apply to All Systems)

**1. Purpose Clarity**

* Does the system know what experience it's creating?
* Do all components serve that purpose?
* Test: Can you state the aesthetic goal in one sentence?

**2. Internal Coherence**

* Do mechanics work together or fight each other?
* Does context match mechanics match pacing?
* Test: Does anything feel "bolted on"?

**3. Appropriate Complexity**

* Is complexity justified by purpose?
* Is it manageable for the target audience?
* Test: Can players learn it in reasonable time?

**4. Feedback Clarity**

* Do players understand cause and effect?
* Can they learn from outcomes?
* Test: After failure, do players know what to do differently?

**5. Meaningful Decisions**

* Do choices matter?
* Are there interesting trade-offs?
* Test: Do players agonize over decisions?

### Context-Dependent Criteria

**For Challenge-Based Games (D\&D, XCOM, Civ):**

* Balance (fairness, difficulty curve)
* Skill expression (better play = better outcomes)
* Strategic depth (multiple viable approaches)

**For Narrative Games (PbtA, FATE, Weather Factory):**

* Narrative emergence (do interesting stories happen?)
* Collaborative storytelling (player agency in fiction)
* Thematic resonance (mechanics reflect theme)

**For Progression Games (D\&D, Civ):**

* Growth satisfaction (feel of getting stronger)
* Positive feedback loops (success enables more success)
* Milestone pacing (clear progress markers)

**For Mystery Games (Cultist Simulator, investigation TTRPGs):**

* Discovery rewards (aha! moments)
* Information management (what to reveal when)
* Opacity balance (mysterious but not impenetrable)

## The Investment/Payoff Spectrum

### Understanding Player Investment

**Games exist on a spectrum of required investment:**

**Low Investment (Immediate Payoff):**

* Fast games, action focus, minimal setup
* Jump right in, shoot things, quick satisfaction
* Examples: Arcade games, action roguelikes, quick card games
* **When appropriate:** Tired players, casual sessions, broad audiences

**Medium Investment (Balanced):**

* Some learning curve, some commitment
* Rewards engagement but doesn't demand mastery
* Examples: D\&D 5e, Civ (early game), most modern games
* **When appropriate:** Regular gaming sessions, invested but not obsessive

**High Investment (Deep Payoff):**

* Steep learning curves, long commitment
* Requires focus, attention, mental energy
* Deep attachment, memorable experiences
* Examples: Cultist Simulator, Dwarf Fortress, complex strategy games
* **When appropriate:** Dedicated players, when you have energy/time

**This is a DESIGN CHOICE, not a quality judgment.**

### Matching Investment to Context

**Critical insight:**
The same player needs different investment levels at different times.

**After work (exhausted):**

* Can't invest: Skip lore, fall asleep during 4X, just want to shoot
* Need: Low-investment games
* Appropriate: Action, simple loops, immediate feedback

**Weekend (energized):**

* Can invest: Deep strategy, complex systems, long sessions
* Want: High-investment games
* Appropriate: 4X campaigns, TTRPG sessions, Cultist Simulator

**Design implication:**
Know your target investment level. Don't demand more (or less) than players can give.

### Investment Components

**What players invest:**

**1. Time**

* How long to learn?
* How long per session?
* How many sessions to complete?

**2. Attention**

* How much mental energy?
* How much focus required?
* Can you play while tired/distracted?

**3. Emotional**

* How much do you care about outcomes?
* How attached to characters/progress?
* How devastating is failure?

**4. Social**

* How much coordination with others?
* How much shared context needed?
* How much communication required?

**5. Mastery**

* How much do you need to learn?
* How deep is optimal play?
* How much does skill matter?

### Payoff Types

**What players get back:**

**1. Immediate satisfaction**

* Moment-to-moment fun
* Visceral feedback
* "Feel good" mechanics

**2. Achievement**

* Completing goals
* Overcoming challenges
* Visible progress

**3. Narrative/emotional**

* Interesting stories
* Character attachment
* Memorable moments

**4. Social**

* Shared experiences
* Cooperative success
* Competitive victory

**5. Mastery satisfaction**

* Getting better at game
* Understanding depth
* Optimal play rewards

**6. Discovery**

* Learning rules (Cultist Simulator)
* Uncovering lore
* Finding secrets

### Design Principle: Match Investment to Payoff

**Cultist Simulator:**

* Investment: High (opaque, complex, demanding)
* Payoff: Discovery, mastery, narrative
* **Match:** If you invest the attention, you get meaningful rewards
* **Risk:** If player can't invest, they bounce off

**Book of Hours:**

* Investment: Low-medium (same mechanics, gentler)
* Payoff: Meditative relaxation, cozy satisfaction
* **Match:** Less demanded, different reward
* **Risk:** High-investment players might find it too easy

**D\&D 5e:**

* Investment: Medium (accessible but has depth)
* Payoff: Heroic fantasy, character growth, social fun
* **Match:** Balanced for regular gaming groups
* **Success:** Broadest audience D\&D ever

**D\&D 4e:**

* Investment: High (tactical complexity, system mastery)
* Payoff: Balanced tactical combat
* **Mismatch:** Demanded more investment than casual D\&D players wanted to give
* **Failure:** Wrong investment level for audience

**Key insight:**
Know how much you're asking players to invest. Make sure the payoff justifies it for your target audience.

## System Design Process

### Step 1: Define the Aesthetic (Experience Goal)

**Start here. Always.**

Ask:

* What should players FEEL? (tension, wonder, competence, fear, joy, etc.)
* What should players WANT to do? (explore, optimize, create, compete, cooperate, discover)
* What should players REMEMBER? (close calls, aha moments, shared stories, epic wins)
* What INVESTMENT LEVEL are you targeting? (exhausted casual vs energized dedicated)

**Examples:**

* Cultist Simulator: "Feel isolated and desperate while uncovering forbidden knowledge"
* D\&D 5e: "Feel like a hero in accessible medieval fantasy with friends"
* XCOM: "Feel tense from high-stakes tactical decisions with permanent consequences"
* Book of Hours: "Feel relaxed and meditative while restoring a library"

**This is your north star. Every decision should serve this.**

### Step 2: Design Mechanics to Enable the Aesthetic

**Not: "What mechanics are cool?"**
**Instead: "What mechanics create the intended feelings?"**

**Questions:**

* What actions should be possible?
* How should outcomes be determined?
* What resources create the right decisions?
* What resolution mechanic serves the aesthetic?

**Examples:**

**For tension (XCOM):**

* 2 actions per turn (forces hard choices)
* Permadeath (stakes are permanent)
* % to hit visible (creates "95% miss" stories)

**For discovery (Cultist Simulator):**

* Opaque mechanics (figuring out IS the game)
* Card combinations (experimentation required)
* Breadcrumbs not tutorials (respect intelligence)

**For collaborative storytelling (FATE):**

* Aspects (narrative tags players create)
* Fate points (buy narrative control)
* Transparent fiction (everyone sees everything)

**Warning signs you're doing this wrong:**

* "I want to use cards because cards are cool"
* "Let's add crafting because players like crafting"
* "Everyone has skill trees now, so we should too"

**If you can't explain HOW the mechanic serves the aesthetic, cut it.**

### Step 3: Set Parameters to Tune the Experience

**Same mechanics, different feel through parameters.**

**Questions:**

* How scarce should resources be?
* How fast should things happen?
* How dangerous should failure be?
* What limits create the right pressure?
* How quickly should things recover?

**Examples:**

**For horror (Cultist Simulator):**

* Extreme scarcity (never enough)
* Fast timers (60 seconds, constant pressure)
* Deadly failure (one mistake = death spiral)
* No limits on board (drowning in cards)
* Slow recovery (healing is expensive)

**For cozy (Book of Hours):**

* Gentle abundance (enough for everyone)
* Same timers but no pressure
* Forgiving failure (rarely deadly)
* Organized limits (not overwhelming)
* Quick recovery (mistakes easily fixed)

**For accessible heroic fantasy (D\&D 5e):**

* Moderate scarcity (spell slots limited but not crippling)
* Turn-based (time to think)
* Recoverable failure (death possible but can be prevented/reversed)
* Bounded accuracy (math stays manageable)
* Short/long rest cycles (clear recovery rhythm)

**This is where you can create variety without new mechanics.**

### Step 4: Frame with Context

**Setting, tone, and goals aren't cosmetic - they're systemic.**

**Questions:**

* What's the setting? Why this setting?
* What's the tone? (Gritty? Heroic? Cozy? Dark?)
* What are the goals? (Victory conditions, implicit objectives)
* What does this represent? (Theme, meaning)

**Examples:**

**Cultist Simulator:**

* Setting: 1920s occult England
* Tone: Isolated, forbidden, dangerous
* Goal: Ascension (mysterious, undefined on purpose)
* Theme: Obsession, forbidden knowledge, mortality

**All of this reinforces the desperate horror aesthetic.**

**PbtA games:**

* Monsterhearts: Teen supernatural drama → moves about social warfare
* Dungeon World: Heroic fantasy → moves about adventure
* The Sprawl: Cyberpunk heists → moves about missions

**Same 2d6 engine, completely different through context.**

**Don't just pick a setting because it's popular. Pick it because it serves the aesthetic.**

### Step 5: Design Pacing

**When do things happen? How does tension build?**

**Questions:**

* Real-time or turn-based? Why?
* When is there pressure? When is there breathing room?
* How does tension escalate?
* What's the rhythm of play?

**Examples:**

**XCOM timed missions:**

* Adds turn limits to same mechanics
* Creates aggressive play (vs defensive)
* Changes feel of entire game

**D\&D rest cycles:**

* Short rest (partial recovery)
* Long rest (full recovery)
* Creates "adventuring day" rhythm
* Resource management over multiple encounters

**Cultist Simulator Time Passes:**

* Every 60 seconds, consume Funds
* Creates constant background pressure
* Can never truly relax

**Book of Hours (no Time Passes death):**

* Same timer mechanics
* No deadly pressure
* Completely different feel

**Pacing is often the difference between success and failure.**

### Step 6: Test for Coherent Configuration

**Do all five components work together?**

**Questions:**

* Does every component serve the same aesthetic?
* Do mechanics match parameters match context match pacing?
* Can players intuitively understand what matters?
* Does it feel unified or bolted-together?

**Red flags:**

* "This mechanic is cool but doesn't fit the theme"
* "Players keep trying to do X but the system doesn't support it"
* "The game says it's about Y but rewards Z"
* "This feels like three different games"

**Good signs:**

* Players naturally do what you intended
* Everything reinforces the same message
* When you explain one part, others make sense
* Feels inevitable (like it couldn't be any other way)

### Step 7: Validate the Aesthetic

**Do players actually experience what you intended?**

**Playtest questions:**

* What did you feel while playing?
* What did you want to do?
* What will you remember?
* How much investment did this require?
* Was the payoff worth the investment?

**If the answers don't match your Step 1 goals, iterate on Steps 2-6.**

**Common mismatches:**

* You wanted tension, players felt tedium
* You wanted mystery, players felt confusion
* You wanted challenge, players felt unfairness
* You wanted relaxation, players felt boredom

**Don't blame players. Fix the configuration.**

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Starting with Mechanics Instead of Aesthetics

**Symptoms:**

* "I want to use cards" (why?)
* "Everyone loves crafting" (does it serve your purpose?)
* "Let's make it like \[popular game]" (but for what experience?)

**Solution:**
Start with aesthetic. Always. If you can't explain how a mechanic serves the intended experience, cut it.

### 2. Adding Complexity Without Purpose

**Symptoms:**

* "Let's add a crafting system" (why?)
* "More options = more depth" (not always)
* "Players like customization" (at what cost?)

**Solution:**
Complexity is a budget. Spend it only on things that serve the aesthetic. D\&D 4e and Civ IV show that more systems can hurt more than help.

### 3. Ignoring Parameters

**Symptoms:**

* "Same mechanics but feels wrong" (check parameters)
* "Playtesters say it's too easy/hard" (tune parameters, not mechanics)
* "The pacing is off" (parameters, not mechanics)

**Solution:**
Remember Weather Factory - you can create completely different experiences with the same mechanics by tuning parameters. Try that before reinventing mechanics.

### 4. Treating Context as Cosmetic

**Symptoms:**

* "We'll add flavor text later"
* "Art is just polish"
* "Setting doesn't matter, mechanics are core"

**Solution:**
Context is systemic. Horror + card crafting = horror game. Cozy + card crafting = cozy game. Context shapes how players interpret everything.

### 5. Wrong Investment Level for Audience

**Symptoms:**

* Casual players bounce off (too much investment required)
* Hardcore players say "too simple" (not enough depth for investment)
* Players engage differently than intended (treating Cultist Simulator like action game)

**Solution:**
Know your target investment level. Match it to your audience. Cultist Simulator's opacity is perfect for dedicated players, terrible for casual players. That's a feature, not a bug.

### 6. Incoherent Configuration

**Symptoms:**

* Feels like different games stapled together
* Players confused about what matters
* Mechanics say one thing, context says another

**Solution:**
Everything must serve the same aesthetic. If something doesn't fit, cut it or change it. D\&D 4e failed here - mechanics said "tactical board game," context said "D\&D RPG."

### 7. No Feedback Loops

**Symptoms:**

* Players don't know why they failed
* Can't learn from mistakes
* Outcomes feel random

**Solution:**
Clarity matters. XCOM shows % to hit. D\&D explains why you missed. Even Cultist Simulator's opacity has breadcrumbs. Players need to understand causality.

### 8. Ignoring Pacing

**Symptoms:**

* Early game great, late game tedious (Civ IV)
* No peaks and valleys (constant intensity burns out)
* Wrong rhythm for context (horror needs breathing room)

**Solution:**
Pacing transforms mechanics. Same combat system feels different at different pacing. Design escalation curves, rest cycles, pressure valves.

## How LLMs Change Game Systems

### What LLMs Enable

**Complex state tracking:**

* Track relationships, reputation, consequences that human GM can't
* Cultist Simulator-level complexity without bookkeeping burden
* Civ-scale simulation in TTRPG

**Dynamic parameter adjustment:**

* Tune scarcity, pressure, difficulty on the fly
* Detect player struggle → adjust
* Maintain intended aesthetic even as players vary

**Context maintenance:**

* Enforce tone and theme consistently
* Generate content that matches established fiction
* Kennedy's "writer first" approach automated

**Natural language resolution:**

* Fiction-first mechanics without skill lists
* PbtA-style "describe action → identify move" automated
* FATE-style aspects natural for LLMs

**Adaptive pacing:**

* Detect when pressure needed
* Create breathing room when needed
* Balance short-term goals with long-term planning

### What LLMs Don't Change

**Purpose still comes first:**

* LLM doesn't determine aesthetic
* Designer must still start with "what experience?"
* Technology serves vision, not vice versa

**Players need agency:**

* Automation must be optional
* Dice rolling is ritual (don't remove)
* Players must feel in control

**Feedback must be clear:**

* Can't be black box
* Players need to understand causality
* Transparency enables engagement

**Investment still matters:**

* LLM can't make tired players energized
* Match investment level to context
* Respect player state

**Configuration still needs design:**

* LLM doesn't auto-configure coherent systems
* Designer must align mechanics/parameters/context/pacing
* Art, not just craft

### LLM Opportunities by System Type

**For Challenge Games (D\&D, XCOM):**

* Dynamic difficulty balancing
* Complex enemy AI that learns
* State tracking for consequences
* But: preserve fairness, clarity, player skill expression

**For Narrative Games (PbtA, FATE, Weather Factory):**

* Natural language move identification
* Collaborative worldbuilding support
* Maintaining consistency in emergent fiction
* Following GM principles invisibly

**For Progression Games (Civ, D\&D):**

* Complex economic simulation
* Faction behavior and world state
* Optimization assistance (without removing decisions)
* But: preserve "one more turn" compulsion

**For Mystery Games (Cultist Simulator):**

* Consistent secrets and clues
* Fair-play mystery guarantee
* Breadcrumb generation
* But: preserve discovery satisfaction

### Design Principles for LLM-Enabled Systems

**1. Use LLM for complexity, present simplicity**

* LLM tracks complex state
* Present clean choices to players
* Civ VI approach: complex back-end, clear UI

**2. Automate tedium, not decisions**

* Bookkeeping: yes
* Interesting choices: no
* Players need meaningful decisions

**3. Make adaptation transparent**

* Don't hide difficulty adjustment
* Explain why outcomes happened
* Maintain causality understanding

**4. Preserve rituals and agency**

* Dice rolling matters
* Character creation matters
* Don't automate everything just because you can

**5. Follow principles, not scripts**

* PbtA GM Agenda/Principles
* FATE's "Be a fan of the characters"
* Let LLM maintain aesthetic consistently

**6. Enable, don't replace**

* LLM as co-GM, not replacement
* LLM as tool, not oracle
* Players and humans still central

## Conclusion: The Art of Configuration

**A game system is not its mechanics.**

It's the artful configuration of mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing to create a specific experience that matches the investment players can give.

**The five systems we studied teach us:**

* D\&D: Identity anchors innovation; accessibility matters
* PbtA: Purpose determines mechanics; simple core enables variety
* Civ: Manage complexity through presentation; "one more turn"
* XCOM: Radical simplification can add depth; preserve what matters
* FATE: Narrative mechanics work; collaborative storytelling is system

**Weather Factory teaches us:**

* Same mechanics can create opposite experiences through parameters
* Context is systemic, not cosmetic
* Writer-first design works (minimal mechanics, maximal configuration)
* Mystery can BE the system (opacity serves purpose)

**MDA teaches us:**

* Start with aesthetic (experience goal)
* Design mechanics to serve it
* Parameters tune the feel
* Context frames the meaning
* Pacing controls when

**Investment/payoff teaches us:**

* Match what you ask to what players can give
* Same player needs different investment levels at different times
* Design for your target state (exhausted casual vs energized dedicated)
* Payoff must justify investment

**For LLM-enabled games:**

* Use LLM to track complexity, present simplicity
* Automate tedium, preserve decisions
* Enable dynamic parameter tuning
* Maintain context consistency
* But preserve agency, ritual, clarity

**The ultimate lesson:**

Good systems know what they are, who they're for, and what they're trying to achieve. Every component - mechanics, parameters, context, pacing, configuration - serves the same aesthetic goal. They respect the investment players can give and deliver payoffs that justify it.

**Bad systems:**

* Start with mechanics instead of aesthetics
* Add complexity without purpose
* Treat context as cosmetic
* Demand wrong investment level
* Have incoherent configuration

**The art of game design is configuration:**
Choosing the right components and combining them so they work together to consistently create the intended experience for the target audience at the appropriate investment level.

Everything else is details.
