title: Framework for Deriving Measurables from Aesthetics
---
Excellent point. You're right - those four measurables are too specific to combat-heavy systems. We need a **general framework** for deriving measurables from any aesthetic, not just examples.

Let me think through this systematically.

## Framework for Deriving Measurables from Aesthetics

### Step 1: Aesthetic → Core Experience Components

Every aesthetic creates experience through some combination of:

1. **Temporal dynamics** (How does experience unfold over time?)
2. **Agency dynamics** (What choices matter and why?)
3. **Information dynamics** (What do players know/discover?)
4. **Risk dynamics** (What's at stake and how?)
5. **Social dynamics** (How do players interact?)
6. **Progress dynamics** (How does advancement work?)
7. **Emotional dynamics** (What feelings are evoked?)

Different aesthetics emphasize different components.

### Step 2: Experience Components → Generic Measurables

For each component, we can identify measurable properties:

#### 1. Temporal Dynamics Measurables

**What we're measuring: How experience unfolds over time**

* **Cycle length**: Time from decision to resolution

  * Micro (seconds): StarCraft unit control
  * Short (minutes): D\&D combat round
  * Medium (hours): Civilization turn
  * Long (sessions): Campaign story arc
* **Rhythm variability**: Consistency vs. variance in pacing

  * Steady (metronome): Each round takes similar time
  * Variable (jazz): Different situations take different time
  * Punctuated (explosive): Long quiet + sudden intensity
* **Engagement continuity**: Can players disengage safely?

  * Real-time continuous: Must maintain attention (StarCraft)
  * Turn-based discrete: Can pause between decisions (Chess)
  * Asynchronous: Can walk away anytime (Play-by-post)
* **Session structure**: How does single session flow?

  * Single arc: One continuous experience
  * Multiple arcs: Several distinct beats
  * Episodic: Independent scenes/encounters
  * Open: No predetermined structure

#### 2. Agency Dynamics Measurables

**What we're measuring: What choices matter and why**

* **Decision frequency**: How often do meaningful choices occur?

  * Per second (twitch games)
  * Per minute (tactical games)
  * Per scene (narrative games)
  * Per session (strategic campaign games)
* **Decision complexity**: How hard are choices to evaluate?

  * Obvious optimal (execution challenge)
  * Clear tradeoffs (strategic choice)
  * Unclear outcomes (risk assessment)
  * Intractable (too complex to solve, use intuition)
* **Agency scope**: What can players affect?

  * Immediate (this action's outcome)
  * Tactical (this scene/encounter)
  * Strategic (this session/arc)
  * Campaign (long-term consequences)
* **Choice reversibility**: Can decisions be undone?

  * Fully reversible: Can try again
  * Costly reversible: Can undo with penalty
  * Partially reversible: Some consequences permanent
  * Irreversible: Permanent consequences
* **Option space size**: How many choices per decision point?

  * Binary (2 options)
  * Limited (3-5 options)
  * Moderate (6-12 options)
  * Large (13+ options)
  * Open-ended (natural language)

#### 3. Information Dynamics Measurables

**What we're measuring: What players know/discover**

* **Information transparency**: What's visible vs. hidden?

  * Perfect information: All game state visible (Chess)
  * Partial information: Some hidden (Poker hands)
  * Imperfect information: Uncertainty about state (Fog of war)
  * Asymmetric information: Players know different things
* **Discovery rate**: How fast do players learn?

  * All upfront: Rules/world known from start
  * Gradual reveal: Systematic introduction
  * Player-driven: Discover through exploration
  * Emergent: Learn through experimentation
* **Knowledge retention requirement**: Must players remember?

  * Ephemeral: Only current state matters
  * Short-term: Remember within session
  * Long-term: Remember across sessions
  * Reference-based: Can look up, no memorization needed
* **Clue/information density**: How much to track?

  * Minimal: Single thread to follow
  * Moderate: A few threads
  * Complex: Many interconnected threads
  * Overwhelming: Too much to fully track (intentional)

#### 4. Risk Dynamics Measurables

**What we're measuring: What's at stake and how**

* **Consequence severity**: How bad is failure?

  * Trivial: Retry with no penalty
  * Minor: Small setback
  * Moderate: Significant but recoverable
  * Major: Permanent loss
  * Terminal: Game/character ends
* **Risk frequency**: How often do consequences occur?

  * Constant: Every action has stakes
  * Regular: Most decisions have stakes
  * Occasional: Some key moments have stakes
  * Rare: Few critical decision points
* **Recovery speed**: How fast can losses be recovered?

  * Instant: Immediate recovery
  * Fast: Within scene/encounter
  * Medium: Within session
  * Slow: Multiple sessions
  * Never: Permanent loss
* **Risk visibility**: Can players assess danger?

  * Explicit: Exact probabilities/stakes shown
  * Estimated: General sense of risk
  * Ambiguous: Unclear danger level
  * Hidden: Unknown risks

#### 5. Social Dynamics Measurables

**What we're measuring: How players interact**

* **Coordination requirement**: Must players work together?

  * Independent: Can succeed alone
  * Optional cooperation: Better together but not required
  * Required cooperation: Must coordinate
  * Dependent: Success requires specific coordination
* **Communication bandwidth**: How much talk needed?

  * Silent: No communication needed
  * Minimal: Brief coordination
  * Moderate: Ongoing discussion
  * Intensive: Constant negotiation
* **Conflict structure**: How do players compete?

  * No conflict: Purely cooperative
  * Soft conflict: Competing for shared resource
  * Direct conflict: Zero-sum competition
  * Negotiable conflict: Deals possible
* **Attention distribution**: Can cognitive load be shared?

  * Individual: Each player tracks own domain
  * Shared: Team shares cognitive burden
  * Specialized: Different roles have different loads
  * Centralized: One player (GM) handles complexity

#### 6. Progress Dynamics Measurables

**What we're measuring: How advancement works**

* **Progress visibility**: Can players see advancement?

  * Explicit: Numbers increase, levels gained
  * Qualitative: New options, not bigger numbers
  * Implicit: Player skill improves, system unchanged
  * Narrative: Story position changes
* **Progress rate**: How fast do players advance?

  * Per session: Visible growth each time
  * Per arc: Growth at story milestones
  * Per campaign: Slow overall progression
  * No progression: Flat power curve
* **Progress type**: What kind of advancement?

  * Vertical: Numbers increase (more powerful)
  * Lateral: Options increase (more versatile)
  * Unlocking: New areas/content accessible
  * Narrative: Story position changes
  * Mastery: Player skill improves
* **Investment requirement**: What's needed to progress?

  * Time: Just play, you advance
  * Success: Must succeed to progress
  * Resources: Must spend to advance
  * Discovery: Must find advancement opportunities

#### 7. Emotional Dynamics Measurables

**What we're measuring: What feelings are evoked**

* **Tension gradient**: How does stress build/release?

  * Constant low: Steady comfortable state
  * Waves: Build-up and release cycles
  * Ratcheting: Gradually increasing pressure
  * Spikes: Sudden intense moments
  * Sustained high: Continuous pressure
* **Surprise frequency**: How often are expectations violated?

  * Predictable: Follows expected patterns
  * Occasional surprises: Some twists
  * Frequent surprises: Regular unexpected events
  * Chaotic: Constantly unexpected
* **Emotional stakes**: What feelings are at risk?

  * Pride/mastery: Can I succeed?
  * Social: Will others approve/like me?
  * Identity: Who is my character?
  * Safety: Will bad things happen?
  * Fairness: Is this just?
* **Catharsis opportunity**: Are there release moments?

  * Continuous: No clear resolution points
  * Scene-level: Each scene has closure
  * Session-level: Each session has payoff
  * Arc-level: Major payoffs rare but powerful

## Step 3: Aesthetic → Measurable Selection Matrix

Now we create a matrix showing which measurables matter for which aesthetics:

### Challenge Aesthetic

**Core Experience:** Overcoming difficult obstacles through skill/strategy

**Primary Measurables:**

* Decision frequency: High (many choices)
* Decision complexity: Clear tradeoffs (can be optimized)
* Consequence severity: Moderate (recoverable but costly)
* Risk visibility: Explicit (can assess danger)
* Progress visibility: Explicit (can see improvement)
* Tension gradient: Waves (build-up and release)

**Secondary Measurables:**

* Cycle length: Short to medium (feedback loops matter)
* Option space: Moderate to large (enable strategy)
* Information transparency: Partial (some uncertainty)
* Recovery speed: Medium (mistakes matter but not terminal)

**Don't Care Much About:**

* Social dynamics (unless competitive)
* Narrative stakes
* Surprise frequency

**Example Targets for Tactical Challenge:**

* Decision frequency: 2-4 per minute
* Decision complexity: 3-5 meaningful options with clear tradeoffs
* Cycle length: 3-5 minutes per resolution
* Consequence severity: 20-30% resource loss on failure
* Recovery speed: 2-3 cycles to full recovery
* Risk visibility: 70-80% predictable outcomes

### Fellowship Aesthetic

**Core Experience:** Social bonding and shared experience

**Primary Measurables:**

* Communication bandwidth: Moderate to intensive
* Coordination requirement: Optional to required
* Attention distribution: Shared (enables talking)
* Social conflict structure: Low to negotiable
* Surprise frequency: Occasional (enables stories)

**Secondary Measurables:**

* Decision frequency: Low (leaves time for social)
* Decision complexity: Low to moderate (doesn't dominate attention)
* Tension gradient: Waves or constant low (comfortable)
* Emotional stakes: Social and identity focused

**Don't Care Much About:**

* Mechanical balance/fairness
* Optimal strategy
* Resource efficiency

**Example Targets:**

* Communication bandwidth: 50%+ of session time for discussion
* Decision frequency: 0.5-1 per minute (mechanical)
* Decision complexity: Simple mechanical, complex social
* Coordination: 60%+ decisions benefit from group input
* Attention distribution: No single player tracks >30% of complexity

### Discovery Aesthetic

**Core Experience:** Exploring and learning about world/systems

**Primary Measurables:**

* Information transparency: Imperfect (things to discover)
* Discovery rate: Player-driven (exploration rewarded)
* Knowledge retention: Reference-based (don't memorize, explore)
* Progress type: Unlocking (new areas/content)
* Surprise frequency: Frequent (exploration yields new things)

**Secondary Measurables:**

* Option space: Open-ended (enables experimentation)
* Consequence severity: Low to moderate (failure doesn't halt exploration)
* Agency scope: Strategic (decisions open new paths)
* Clue density: Complex (many threads to follow)

**Don't Care Much About:**

* Optimal strategy (exploration is the point)
* Mechanical balance
* Time-to-resolution

**Example Targets:**

* Information transparency: 30-50% visible at start
* Discovery rate: 1-2 new elements per session
* Knowledge density: 5-10 trackable threads
* Consequence severity: Exploration rarely punished permanently
* Surprise frequency: 1-2 unexpected discoveries per session

### Narrative Aesthetic

**Core Experience:** Telling/experiencing compelling stories

**Primary Measurables:**

* Cycle length: Medium (scene-based, not mechanical)
* Agency scope: Strategic (decisions affect story)
* Consequence severity: Moderate to major (dramatic stakes)
* Choice reversibility: Irreversible (choices matter)
* Progress type: Narrative (story position changes)
* Emotional stakes: Identity and social
* Catharsis opportunity: Scene and arc level

**Secondary Measurables:**

* Decision frequency: Low to moderate (meaningful moments)
* Information dynamics: Whatever serves drama
* Tension gradient: Dramatic (build to climax)

**Don't Care Much About:**

* Mechanical optimization
* Perfect balance
* Resource efficiency

**Example Targets:**

* Cycle length: Scene-based (10-30 minutes per resolution)
* Decision frequency: 1-3 major choices per session
* Consequence severity: Always story consequences, sometimes mechanical
* Agency scope: 70%+ decisions affect future scenes
* Choice reversibility: \<30% decisions can be undone
* Catharsis: At least one emotional payoff per session

### Expression Aesthetic

**Core Experience:** Self-discovery and identity creation

**Primary Measurables:**

* Option space: Large to open-ended (many ways to play)
* Progress type: Lateral (new options, not power)
* Decision complexity: Intractable (no optimal, use personality)
* Choice reversibility: Partially reversible (can experiment)
* Agency scope: Strategic (build identity over time)
* Information transparency: Open (options visible upfront)

**Secondary Measurables:**

* Progress visibility: Qualitative (different, not better)
* Social dynamics: Visibility for sharing builds
* Consequence severity: Low (experimentation encouraged)

**Don't Care Much About:**

* Balance between builds
* Optimal efficiency
* Time pressure

**Example Targets:**

* Option space: 20+ viable builds/approaches
* Progress rate: New option every 1-2 sessions
* Choice reversibility: Can respec 50% of choices
* Decision complexity: No clear "best" answer for 70%+ choices
* Agency scope: Identity choices affect 3+ sessions forward

## Step 4: Using the Framework

**For a game designer:**

### Process: Aesthetic → Measurables

**1. Identify your primary aesthetic(s)**

```
Example: Challenge (Tactical) + Narrative (Secondary)
```

**2. Look up which measurables matter**

```
Challenge (Tactical) priorities:
- Decision frequency: HIGH
- Decision complexity: HIGH
- Risk visibility: HIGH
- Tension gradient: HIGH

Narrative priorities:
- Agency scope: HIGH
- Consequence severity: HIGH
- Emotional stakes: HIGH
- Catharsis: HIGH

Combined: Need tactical decisions with narrative consequences
```

**3. Determine your target values**

```
Decision frequency: 2-4/minute (Challenge)
But: Decisions must affect story (Narrative)
Therefore: Each tactical choice should have narrative weight

Cycle length: 
- Challenge wants: Short feedback loops (3-5 min)
- Narrative wants: Scene-based pacing (10-30 min)
Therefore: Tactical encounters within narrative scenes (3-5 combat scenes per 30-min story beat)

Consequence severity:
- Challenge wants: Moderate, recoverable (20-30% resources)
- Narrative wants: Dramatic, story-affecting
Therefore: Mechanical consequences + story consequences both present
```

**4. Design systems to hit those measurables**

```
To achieve "2-4 meaningful decisions per minute":
→ Each combat round = 1 minute
→ Each round offers 3-5 clear options
→ 3-5 round combats
→ Therefore: Damage:HP ratio ~20-25%

To achieve "narrative consequences":
→ Combat outcomes affect story beats
→ Victory conditions include narrative goals
→ Resource depletion affects next scene options
```

**5. Playtest and measure**

```
Did we hit targets?
- Decision frequency: Count decisions per minute
- Narrative weight: Do players discuss story implications?
- Tension gradient: Observe player emotional state
- Catharsis: Do sessions have satisfying endings?

If mismatched, adjust
```

6. Adjust systematically
7. Document for consistency

**Flexibility:**

* Not locked to combat systems (measurables work for any game type)
* Can handle aesthetic combinations (primary + secondary)
* Explicitly shows what matters vs. what doesn't (don't optimize irrelevant measurables)
* Provides both framework AND examples

**Practical:**

* Concrete targets to aim for
* Measurable validation (did we hit targets?)
* Systematic adjustment (if not, what to change)
* Works for their specific game (not just D\&D clones)

Does this framework approach give you what you need? The key is that measurables are **derived from aesthetics systematically**, not just a fixed list of examples.
