# Writing Guidelines for "The Game Design Book"

## Document Purpose

This guide ensures coherence across all chapters as the book grows. It captures:
- Core conceptual commitments (what we've decided and must maintain)
- Terminology standards (consistent language throughout)
- Structural patterns (how chapters are organized)
- Formatting conventions (how examples, tests, hypotheses appear)
- Tone and voice guidelines (how we communicate with readers)
- LLM integration approach (when and how to reference AI assistance)
- Cross-chapter validation (when assumptions need revision)

**Use this document:** 
- Before writing new chapters (understand constraints)
- When editing existing chapters (check consistency)
- When core concepts evolve (document changes and propagate)
- For handoffs to other authors (shared understanding)

---

## Part 1: Core Conceptual Commitments

These are our foundational decisions. **Changes to these require propagating updates across all chapters.**

### Aesthetics Framework

**Primary Source:** MDA Framework (Hunicke, LeBlanc, Zubek, 2004)

**MDA's Eight Aesthetics (Canonical):**
1. **Sensation** - Sensory pleasure, beautiful, visceral, immersive
2. **Fantasy** - Make-believe, imagining yourself in another world
3. **Narrative** - Story and drama
4. **Challenge** - Obstacle course, overcoming difficulty
5. **Fellowship** - Social framework, playing with others
6. **Discovery** - Exploration, finding new things
7. **Expression** - Self-discovery, creativity
8. **Submission** - Pastime, relaxation, "turning brain off"

**Our Four Expansions (From Game Analysis):**
9. **Mastery** - Deep system understanding and optimization (distinct from Challenge: not just overcoming but understanding deeply)
10. **Tension** - Adrenaline, time pressure, high-stakes decisions (distinct from Sensation: psychological pressure not sensory pleasure)
11. **Progression** - Growth, becoming more powerful over time (distinct from Expression: advancement not creativity)
12. **Collection** - Accumulation, completionism, "gotta catch 'em all" (distinct from Discovery: possessing not finding)

**How to Reference:**
```
✓ Correct: "Using MDA framework with our four expansions (Mastery, Tension, Progression, Collection)..."
✓ Correct: "The twelve aesthetics (MDA's eight plus our four)..."
✗ Wrong: "The eight aesthetics of MDA" (ignores our expansions)
✗ Wrong: "Our custom aesthetic framework" (loses MDA attribution)
✗ Wrong: Adding new aesthetics without documenting why and updating all chapters
```

**When to Revise:**
- If chapter analysis reveals aesthetic that doesn't fit any of the 12
- If two aesthetics consistently conflate (might need to merge)
- If one aesthetic never appears in practice (might need to remove)

**Revision Protocol:**
1. Document why change is needed (which chapters/analyses triggered it)
2. Update this section with new definition
3. Create checklist of all chapters referencing aesthetics
4. Propagate changes to all chapters
5. Update running game analysis list with new aesthetic tags

**Current Status:** STABLE (validated across Resources, Cognitive Load, Balance chapters)

### Balance Paradigms

**The Three Working Paradigms:**

1. **Framework-Based Balance**
   - Definition: Explicit decision frameworks create consistent adjudication
   - Key mechanism: Negotiated stakes (Position/Effect style)
   - Canonical example: Blades in the Dark
   - Serves: Narrative, Discovery aesthetics primarily

2. **Consistency-Based Balance**
   - Definition: Static, repeatable challenges enable pattern learning
   - Key mechanism: Fixed parameters, learnable patterns
   - Canonical example: Dark Souls
   - Serves: Challenge, Mastery aesthetics primarily

3. **Adaptive Balance**
   - Definition: Dynamic systems adjust to player performance
   - Key mechanism: Real-time difficulty adjustment
   - Canonical example: Left 4 Dead 2 AI Director
   - Serves: Fellowship, Discovery aesthetics primarily

**Plus:** Hybrid approaches (different paradigms for different subsystems)

**How to Reference:**
```
✓ Correct: "The three paradigms (Framework, Consistency, Adaptive)..."
✓ Correct: "Using Framework paradigm for investigation phase..."
✗ Wrong: "The three balance types" (not specific enough)
✗ Wrong: Inventing new paradigm names (confuses readers)
✗ Wrong: "Dynamic balance" instead of "Adaptive" (terminology drift)
```

**When to Revise:**
- If a major game doesn't fit any paradigm (need new category?)
- If two paradigms consistently conflate (might need to merge)
- If one paradigm never appears in practice (might be theoretical only)

**Revision Protocol:**
1. Document game/scenario that doesn't fit
2. Propose new paradigm or paradigm merger with clear definition
3. Update Balance chapter (Part 2) first
4. Update all chapters referencing paradigms
5. Update worked examples to use new terminology

**Current Status:** STABLE (validated in Balance chapter, works for analyzed games)

### Pacing Framework

**Core Insight:** Pacing is emergent property of temporal dynamics, not a separate mechanism.

**Five Pacing Patterns:**
1. **Attrition** - Gradual pressure buildup, slow resource depletion, strategic decisions compound
2. **Episodic** - Self-contained scenes, fast recovery, fresh start each encounter
3. **Wave** - Cyclical intensity (build → peak → relief → repeat), multiple cycles per session
4. **Continuous** - Steady state, no clear breaks, real-time or seamless flow
5. **Punctuated** - Long calm periods interrupted by sudden intense moments

**Key Measurables:**
- **Cycle Length** - Duration of one pacing cycle (micro to macro)
- **Recovery Frequency** - How often relief periods occur
- **Recovery Speed** - How quickly resources restore (PRIMARY determinant of pattern)
- **Tension Gradient** - How intensity varies over time

**How to Reference:**
```
✓ Correct: "Wave pacing creates natural rhythm through build-peak-relief cycles..."
✓ Correct: "Recovery Speed determines pacing pattern: fast → Episodic, slow → Attrition..."
✗ Wrong: "Flow pacing" (not one of our five patterns)
✗ Wrong: "Pacing system" (it's emergent, not a system)
✗ Wrong: Treating pacing as separate from temporal dynamics
```

**Integration Approach:**
- Pacing discussed within Temporal Dynamics sections (not standalone chapter)
- Patterns referenced in aesthetic-specific guidance
- Measurables used to target and validate pacing

**When to Revise:**
- If pattern doesn't fit real game well (need new pattern or refinement?)
- If measurables insufficient to target pacing (need new measurables?)
- If paradigm-pacing relationships break (Framework doesn't always create Wave?)

**Revision Protocol:**
1. Document game/scenario that doesn't fit patterns
2. Propose new pattern or pattern refinement
3. Update Balance chapter (Part 5: Measurables) first
4. Update all aesthetic-paradigm recipes
5. Update worked examples with new pacing terminology

**Current Status:** STABLE (integrated throughout Balance chapter)

### Resource Classification

**Core Categories (From Resource Management Chapter):**

1. **Renewable vs. Consumable**
   - Renewable: Regenerates over time (HP, mana)
   - Consumable: One-use, gone when spent (potions, items)

2. **Recovery Rate**
   - Fast: Seconds to minutes (modern HP recovery)
   - Slow: 10+ minutes to between sessions (old-school healing)
   - Permanent Loss: Never recovers (permadeath, destroyed units)

3. **Abstraction Level**
   - Concrete: Physical items (potions, arrows)
   - Abstract: Mechanical constructs (HP, stress)
   - Narrative: Story currencies (reputation, trauma)

**How to Reference:**
```
✓ Correct: "HP is a renewable, fast-recovering, abstract resource..."
✓ Correct: "Stress in Blades is renewable but with trauma tracking permanent losses..."
✗ Wrong: Inventing new resource categories without documenting
✗ Wrong: Using different terminology for same concepts
```

**When to Revise:**
- If resource type doesn't fit categories (need new category?)
- If categories overlap confusingly (need to refine?)

**Current Status:** STABLE (from Resources chapter)

### Resource Design Principles (From Resource Management Chapter)

**Core Insight:** Resources are tools for creating aesthetic experiences, not default game elements.

**The Central Question:** "What experience do we want, and what resources create it?" 
NOT: "What resources should this game have?"

**Five Resource Types (Canonical):**

1. **Consumable** - Depletes with use, gone when spent
   - Examples: HP, spell slots, gold, ammunition
   - Creates: Scarcity pressure, strategic allocation

2. **Buffer** - Protects from consequences, renewable
   - Examples: Blades stress, shield points, armor
   - Creates: Active choice (spend buffer vs accept consequence)
   - Innovation: Can separate from consequence resources (Blades harm)

3. **Accumulation** - Collects over time, rarely depletes
   - Examples: XP, reputation, collection items
   - Creates: Progression narrative, milestone satisfaction

4. **Composition** - Quality of combination > quantity
   - Examples: Slay the Spire deck, item builds, team synergy
   - Creates: Curation skill ("less is more" optimization)

5. **Capacity** - Limits what's possible, not what's used
   - Examples: Inventory slots, hand size, load capacity
   - Creates: Opportunity costs, forced prioritization

**Recovery Patterns (Determines Pacing):**

- **No Recovery** (Permanent loss) → Conservative play, high stakes
- **Slow Recovery** (Session/campaign) → Attrition, lasting consequences  
- **Moderate Recovery** (Per-encounter) → Tactical optimization, episodic
- **Fast Recovery** (Constant) → Aggressive play, forgiving
- **Mixed Recovery** (Different rates) → Multiple strategic layers

**Primary Insight:** Recovery speed is PRIMARY determinant of resource play patterns
- Fast recovery enables aggressive tactics (modern D&D, WoW)
- Slow recovery demands conservation (HoMM3, old-school D&D)
- No recovery creates maximum stakes (roguelikes, permadeath)

**Psychological Effects (Must Be Intentional):**

1. **Possession** - What "having" creates experientially
   - Security, identity, potential, status, power
   - Different aesthetics need different possession experiences

2. **Greed** - Accumulation beyond need, hoarding
   - Emerges when accumulation > spending in rewards
   - Good for Collection/Progression, bad for Challenge if prevents spending

3. **FOMO** - Fear of missing out, irreversible scarcity
   - Productive: Meaningful choices, bounded consequences, multiple paths
   - Unproductive: Time-gating, obligation, optimization anxiety

**How to Reference:**
```
✓ Correct: "Stress is a buffer resource (protects from harm) with fast recovery (per-score)..."
✓ Correct: "This creates greed behavior, which serves Collection aesthetic but harms Challenge..."
✗ Wrong: "Player attention is a resource" (it's a constraint, not a resource)
✗ Wrong: Using resource terminology for cognitive load, time, or other constraints
✗ Wrong: Inventing new resource types without documenting
```

**Critical Distinctions to Maintain:**

**Resources vs. Constraints:**
- Resources: In-game entities, tracked by system, can be spent/recovered/traded
- Constraints: Player capacity (cognitive load, time, attention) - external to game state
- Tools for resources (scarcity, recovery) DON'T apply to constraints
- See Cognitive Load section for constraint handling

**Resources vs. Pacing:**
- Resources CREATE pacing through recovery patterns
- Pacing is emergent from resource dynamics
- Recovery speed determines pacing pattern (fast → Episodic, slow → Attrition)

**When to Revise:**
- If resource pattern doesn't fit five types (need new type?)
- If psychological effect not covered (new phenomenon?)
- If recovery-pacing relationship breaks (paradigm shift?)

**Revision Protocol:**
1. Document game/system that doesn't fit
2. Propose addition with clear definition and examples
3. Update Resource Management chapter first
4. Validate across other chapters (does this help or confuse?)
5. Update all chapters referencing resources
6. Add to game analysis repository

**Current Status:** STABLE (validated across Blades, HoMM3, Catan, WoW, Slay the Spire)

**Canonical Examples by Type:**
- Consumable: Modern D&D spell slots (moderate scarcity, per-encounter recovery)
- Buffer: Blades stress (separates protection from consequence)
- Accumulation: WoW reputation (permanent gains, milestone unlocks)
- Composition: Slay the Spire deck (curation > accumulation)
- Capacity: Catan hand limit (forces spending, prevents hoarding)

### Cognitive Load Framework

**Core Insight:** Cognitive load is a CONSTRAINT (external to game state), not a resource (internal game mechanic).

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Resources:** In-game entities (HP, gold, spell slots) - can be spent, recovered, traded
- **Cognitive Load:** Player mental capacity - cannot be "spent" or "recovered" within game mechanics
- Tools for resource design (scarcity, recovery) don't apply to cognitive load
- Must use different strategies: offloading, simplification, support systems

**Seven Load Types:**

1. **Simultaneity Load** - Tracking multiple things at once (real-time pressure, parallel threads)
2. **Decision Load** - Evaluating options and making choices (how many options? how deep?)
3. **Memory/Knowledge Load** - Recalling information (rules, lore, previous state)
4. **Tracking Load** - Monitoring ongoing game state (positions, resources, conditions)
5. **Calculation Load** - Mathematical processing and computation (formulas, probabilities)
6. **Pattern Recognition Load** - Learning through repeated experience (boss patterns, strategic meta)
7. **Social/Communication Load** - Interpersonal coordination, deception, negotiation, reputation

**Load-Aesthetic Relationships:**
- **Challenge aesthetic** → HIGH decision/pattern load (but must be conquerable)
- **Fellowship aesthetic** → LOW mechanical load, HIGH social load (brainspace for socializing)
- **Narrative aesthetic** → LOW calculation load (math breaks immersion)
- **Mastery aesthetic** → HIGH load that DECREASES with practice (front-loaded difficulty)
- **Discovery aesthetic** → Variable load (tolerates "messy" complexity for exploration)
- **Submission aesthetic** → VERY LOW load (relaxation, not mental effort)

**Player Type Preferences (Bartle + Load):**
- **Achievers** → Want conquerable high load (optimization, mastery through effort)
- **Explorers** → Tolerate messy load (discovery-driven, depth over clarity)
- **Socializers** → Prefer low mechanical load (brainspace for social interaction)
- **Killers** → Embrace competitive load (management as competitive advantage)

**Investment Changes Load Over Time:**
- **Load Reduction Pattern** (Dark Souls): Practice internalizes patterns → less cognitive load
- **Load Revelation Pattern** (StarCraft): Basics automate → notice deeper complexity
- **Load Independence Pattern** (Cookie Clicker): Time passes, load stays constant
- **Load Creep Pattern** (Trading Card Games): Complexity accumulates over game's lifecycle

**Core Design Principles:**
1. Match cognitive load to aesthetic goal (Challenge ≠ Fellowship ≠ Narrative)
2. Time pressure reduces complexity budget (real-time vs. turn-based is fundamental)
3. Offload strategically (player/GM/computer/LLM handle different load types)
4. Support necessary load, remove unnecessary load (tools vs. simplification)
5. Load must be perceivable (players must comprehend balanced systems)
6. Design for learning curve (load changes from beginner to expert)

**How to Reference:**
```
✓ Correct: "This creates high simultaneity load appropriate for Challenge aesthetic..."
✓ Correct: "Offload tracking load to character sheet (externalization)..."
✓ Correct: "Socializers prefer low mechanical load, high social load..."
✓ Correct: "Load decreases with practice (Dark Souls pattern)..."
✓ Correct: "Cognitive load is a constraint, not a resource..."
✗ Wrong: "Mental burden" (vague - use specific load type)
✗ Wrong: "Complexity" without specifying which load type
✗ Wrong: "Cognitive tax" (imprecise - specify load type and whether necessary/unnecessary)
✗ Wrong: "Players manage cognitive load" (they manage resources; designers accommodate load)
✗ Wrong: Conflating "difficulty" with "cognitive load" (difficulty is aesthetic, load is constraint)
```

**When to Revise:**
- If new load type emerges that doesn't fit seven categories (document game that breaks framework)
- If aesthetic-load relationships contradict observations (Challenge doesn't need high load?)
- If player type preferences don't hold (Achievers avoid high load?)
- If investment patterns don't match real games (need new pattern?)

**Revision Protocol:**
1. Document game/scenario that doesn't fit framework (specific example with analysis)
2. Propose new load type or refinement with clear definition and scope
3. Update Cognitive Load chapter (Parts 1-3) first
4. Update all chapters referencing load (Resources, Balance, case studies)
5. Update game analysis repository with new load categorizations
6. Update design process framework (Part 9) with new considerations
7. Validate changes don't contradict existing examples

**Current Status:** STABLE (validated across Resources, Balance chapters; two case studies; 15+ game analyses)

## Part 2: Terminology Standards

### Mandatory Terms (Never Substitute)

**Aesthetic** (not "experience goal," "feeling," "vibe")
- Use: "Challenge aesthetic" ✓
- Not: "Challenge experience" ✗

**Paradigm** (not "approach," "method," "style")
- Use: "Framework paradigm" ✓
- Not: "Framework approach" ✗

**Measurable** (not "metric," "variable," "stat")
- Use: "Pattern Consistency measurable" ✓
- Not: "Pattern Consistency metric" ✗

**Pacing Pattern** (not "rhythm," "flow," "tempo")
- Use: "Wave pacing pattern" ✓
- Not: "Wave rhythm" ✗

**Resource** (not "currency," "commodity," unless specifically about in-world abstraction level)
- Use: "HP is a resource" ✓
- Not: "HP is a currency" ✗ (unless discussing narrative framing)

**Cognitive Load Terms** (always use specific types):

**The Seven Load Types (Mandatory - Never Substitute):**
- "Simultaneity load" (not "multitasking," "parallel processing," "concurrent demands")
- "Decision load" (not "choice complexity," "option overload," "decision space")
- "Memory load" or "Knowledge load" (not "recall burden," "knowledge requirements," "memorization")
- "Tracking load" (not "state management," "bookkeeping," "monitoring burden")
- "Calculation load" (not "math burden," "computational complexity," "arithmetic overhead")
- "Pattern recognition load" (not "learning curve," "skill development," "mastery requirement")
- "Social load" or "Communication load" (not "coordination overhead," "social complexity")

**Load Management Terms:**
- "Support load" (not "reduce burden," "help players") - when providing tools/UI/externalization
- "Remove load" (not "simplify," "dumb down") - when eliminating unnecessary complexity
- "Offload" (not "delegate," "transfer") - when moving load to GM/computer/LLM
- "Externalize" (not "document," "write down") - when moving memory to physical/digital aids
- "Necessary load" (not "good complexity") - load that serves experience
- "Unnecessary load" (not "bad complexity," "friction") - load that obstructs experience

**Resource-Related Terms (From Resource Management Chapter):**
- "Buffer resource" (not "protective resource," "shield resource") - Blades stress-type resources
- "Composition resource" (not "build resource," "synergy resource") - deck-building type resources
- "Consumable resource" (not "spent resource," "used-up resource") - depletes with use
- "Accumulation resource" (not "progression resource," "growth resource") - collects over time
- "Capacity resource" (not "limit resource," "slot resource") - constrains what's possible
- "Recovery pattern" (not "regeneration," "refresh rate," "restoration") - how resources replenish
- "Possession effect" (not "having experience," "ownership feeling") - psychological state from owning
- "Greed behavior" (not "hoarding," "accumulation syndrome") - psychological pattern
- "FOMO" (not "anxiety," "scarcity stress") - Fear of Missing Out, only for time-limited content

**Resource Recovery Terms:**
- "Fast recovery" (not "quick refresh," "instant regen") - seconds to minutes
- "Moderate recovery" (not "medium refresh") - per-encounter, per-scene
- "Slow recovery" (not "long cooldown") - per-session, per-campaign
- "No recovery" (not "permanent loss" in adjective form) - never recovers
- "Mixed recovery" (not "variable recovery") - different rates for different resources

**Critical Distinctions:**
- "Cognitive load is a constraint" (not "resource," "currency," "cost")
- "Players have cognitive capacity" (not "manage cognitive load," "spend attention")
- "Designers accommodate load" (not "players control load," "balance complexity")
- **"Resource" vs. "Constraint"** (CRITICAL - never confuse these):
  - Resource: In-game entity (HP, gold, stress) - tracked by system, can be spent/recovered/traded
  - Constraint: External limitation (cognitive load, time, attention) - player capacity, not game mechanic
  - NEVER say: "Attention is a resource" or "Cognitive load is a resource"
  - ALWAYS say: "Attention is a constraint" or "Cognitive load is a design constraint"
  - Rationale: Tools for resource design (scarcity, recovery) don't apply to constraints

**Context-Specific:**
- "Load profile" (not "complexity level," "difficulty curve") - overall cognitive demand pattern
- "Load mismatch" (not "complexity problem," "difficulty issue") - when load doesn't serve aesthetic
- "Load appropriate" (not "well-designed," "balanced") - when load matches intended experience

### Preferred Terms (Use Consistently)

**"Player" vs. "User"**
- Use: "Player" for games
- Use: "User" only when discussing software/tools
- Never: "Gamer" (unnecessary specificity)

**"Designer" vs. "Developer"**
- Use: "Designer" for decision-maker
- Use: "Developer" when specifically about implementation
- Context: "Designer decides HP values, developer implements HP system"

**"Session" vs. "Game"**
- Use: "Session" for single play period
- Use: "Game" for overall design
- Example: "5-hour session of a campaign game"

**"System" vs. "Mechanism"**
- Use: "System" for interconnected components
- Use: "Mechanism" for specific rule/procedure
- Example: "Resource management system uses depletion mechanisms"

**Resource Design Terminology:**
- "Creates meaningful choices" (not "makes players think," "adds strategy")
- "Serves [Aesthetic] aesthetic" (not "makes game more [aesthetic]," "improves [aesthetic]")
- "Forces prioritization" (not "requires planning," "demands decisions")
- "Recovery pattern" (not "refresh cycle," "regeneration system")
- "Permanent loss" (not "no recovery" as noun) - when describing the result
- "No recovery" (not "permanent loss" as adjective) - when describing the pattern

**Framework" (overloaded term)**
- Context clarifies:
  - "MDA framework" (aesthetic theory)
  - "Framework paradigm" (balance approach)
  - "Constraint satisfaction framework" (our overall methodology)
  - Always specify which framework if ambiguous

### Capitalization Rules

**Capitalize:**
- Aesthetic names: Challenge, Narrative, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression, Submission, Sensation, Fantasy, Mastery, Tension, Progression, Collection
- Paradigm names: Framework, Consistency, Adaptive
- Pacing pattern names: Attrition, Episodic, Wave, Continuous, Punctuated
- Measurable names when used as proper reference: "Time-to-Kill measurable," "Pattern Consistency"
- Game titles: Dark Souls, Blades in the Dark, Left 4 Dead 2

**Don't capitalize:**
- Common usage: "the aesthetic of challenge" (as concept, not proper name)
- Generic terms: "pattern consistency" (as quality, not measurable name)
- Methodological terms: "constraint satisfaction," "balance design"

### Abbreviations (Sparingly)

**Acceptable:**
- MDA (only after first use spells out "Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics")
- HP (only after first use spells out "Hit Points" or "Health Points")
- DPR (only in Balance chapter after defining "Damage Per Round")
- TTK (only in Balance chapter after defining "Time-to-Kill")

**Not acceptable:**
- PC/NPC (spell out "player character," "non-player character")
- GM/DM (spell out "game master" or "dungeon master")
- RPG (spell out "role-playing game" first time in chapter)

**Rationale:** Book is reference material, readers may skip to middle chapters

---

## Part 3: Structural Patterns

### Chapter Structure Template

**Standard chapter organization:**

```markdown
# Chapter Title: [Concept]

## Introduction (1-2 pages)
- What problem does this chapter solve?
- Why it matters for game design
- What you'll learn
- Prerequisites (what chapters to read first)

## Conceptual Foundation (3-5 pages)
- Core concepts introduced
- Definitions and distinctions
- Theoretical grounding (cite sources if applicable)
- Connection to aesthetics/paradigms

## Practical Application (5-10 pages)
- How to apply concepts
- Step-by-step processes
- Decision frameworks
- Examples from real games

## Cognitive Load Considerations (2-4 pages) **[NEW - REQUIRED]**
- What cognitive load types does this system/concept create?
  - Rate each: Simultaneity, Decision, Memory, Tracking, Calculation, Pattern Recognition, Social
  - Justify why each is HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
- How does cognitive load scale?
  - Beginner experience (first session)
  - Intermediate experience (learning phase)
  - Expert experience (mastered)
- How can necessary load be supported?
  - Externalization tools (reference cards, journals, maps)
  - UI/information design (hierarchy, clarity, feedback)
  - Automation/offloading (what GM/computer/LLM can handle)
- What unnecessary load can be removed?
  - Simplification opportunities (without losing depth)
  - Calculation reduction (simple math or automation)
- Which aesthetics does this load profile serve?
  - Primary aesthetic match (Challenge, Fellowship, Narrative, etc.)
  - Secondary aesthetics supported
  - Aesthetics that conflict with this load
- Which player types will this serve/exclude?
  - Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, Killers
  - Load tolerance and preferences
- Load integration considerations:
  - How does this compound with other systems?
  - Total cognitive budget impact
  - Load distribution opportunities (if multiplayer)

**Rationale:** Every game system creates cognitive load. Explicit analysis prevents unintentional load mismatches and helps designers make intentional choices about where players should spend mental effort.

## Common Patterns/Recipes (optional, 5-8 pages)
- Reusable templates
- Common combinations
- When to use which approach

## Case Studies/Deep Dives (3-6 pages)
- Real game analysis
- What worked, what didn't
- Lessons for designers

## Integration with Other Concepts (2-3 pages)
- How this connects to other chapters
- Cross-references
- Holistic view

## Common Pitfalls (2-3 pages)
- What goes wrong
- How to avoid mistakes
- Red flags to watch for

## Quick Reference (1-2 pages)
- Summary tables
- Decision trees
- Key takeaways
- Checklists

## Next Steps
- What to read next
- How to practice
- Resources for deeper dive
```

**Flexibility:** Not all chapters need all sections, but use this as default structure

**Chapter Length Targets:**
- Foundational chapters: 20-30 pages (Game Systems, Aesthetics, Resources)
- Practical chapters: 30-50 pages (Cognitive Load, Balance)
- Synthesis chapters: 15-25 pages (Integration, Takeaways)
- Reference chapters: 40-60 pages (if catalog/comprehensive)

### Section Formatting

**Headings:**
```markdown
# Chapter Title (H1, once per document)

## Major Section (H2, 5-10 per chapter)

### Subsection (H3, detailed breakdowns)

#### Minor point (H4, use sparingly, only for deep nesting)
```

**Lists:**
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet lists for unordered collections
- Use sub-bullets sparingly (max 2 levels deep)
- Keep list items parallel in structure

**Tables:**
- Use for comparisons, reference data
- Maximum 5 columns (readability)
- Include header row always
- Caption above table explaining what it shows

**Code blocks:**
- Use for formulas, algorithms, pseudocode
- Use for data structures
- Always include comment explaining purpose
- Example:
  ```
  Boss HP = Player DPR × Target Rounds
  Where:
    Player DPR = (Player Damage × Hit Rate) × Number of Players
    Target Rounds = Desired fight duration
  ```

### Cross-Referencing

**Internal references (within chapter):**
```markdown
See Section 3.2 for detailed explanation
As discussed in the Paradigm section above
Refer to the Measurables Catalog (Part 5)
```

**External references (to other chapters):**
```markdown
✓ Good: "As established in the Resources chapter..."
✓ Good: "For cognitive load considerations, see Cognitive Load chapter, Section 2.3"
✓ Good: "This connects to pacing (Balance chapter, Temporal Dynamics section)"

✗ Bad: "See earlier chapter" (which one?)
✗ Bad: "As mentioned before" (where?)
✗ Bad: "Page 47 discusses this" (page numbers change in editing)
```

**Forward references:**
```markdown
✓ Good: "We'll explore this in depth in the Balance chapter"
✓ Good: "Playtesting protocol covered in Balance chapter, Part 7"

✗ Bad: "More on this later" (where later?)
```

**Bidirectional references:**
- When chapter A references chapter B, check if B should reference A
- Create reference map as book grows
- Validate references don't create circular dependencies

- Target Audience: Achievers (primarily), some Explorers (environmental storytelling)

**Cognitive Load Profile:**
- **Simultaneity:** LOW (enemies attack one at a time; turn-based enemy patterns despite real-time combat)
- **Decision:** MEDIUM (positioning, timing, when to heal; straightforward but meaningful)
- **Memory/Knowledge:** LOW-MEDIUM (boss patterns learnable through repetition; no complex rules to memorize)
- **Tracking:** LOW (simple stats: HP, stamina, equipment load; minimal UI clutter)
- **Calculation:** MINIMAL (damage shown; no complex formulas required from player)
- **Pattern Recognition:** VERY HIGH (core mechanic - learning enemy patterns through repeated death)
- **Social:** LOW (primarily single-player; optional co-op summons don't require coordination)

**Load Appropriateness:**
- ✅ Load serves aesthetic: VERY HIGH pattern recognition = perfect for Challenge/Mastery
- ✅ Load DECREASES with practice (front-loaded difficulty → mastery satisfaction)
- ✅ Simple controls prevent execution load from competing with pattern learning
- ✅ Turn-based enemy patterns give processing time despite real-time combat
- ✅ Load trajectory: Overwhelming initially → manageable → trivial (demonstrates mastery)

**Load Management:**
- Simple, responsive controls (execution is easy once pattern known)
- Clear visual feedback (can see why you died)
- Consistent enemy behavior (patterns are learnable, not random)
- Bonfires provide safe zones (cognitive recovery between challenges)

**System Analysis:**
- Balance Paradigm: Consistency-Based (fixed patterns enable learning)
- Pacing Pattern: Episodic (death resets encounter, but knowledge persists)
- Resources: HP (slow recovery via Estus), Stamina (fast recovery), Souls (currency + XP, lost on death)
- Key mechanic: Pattern recognition through enforced repetition
```

**Subsequent mentions:**
```markdown
Shorter form: "In Dark Souls, boss patterns remain consistent..."
Or: "Dark Souls demonstrates this with..."
```

**Analysis depth tiers:**

**Tier 1: Brief mention (1-2 sentences)**
- Use: When example supports a point
- Format: "Dark Souls uses this approach by..."

**Tier 2: Medium example (1 paragraph)**
- Use: When example needs explanation
- Format: Game name bold, concept explained, lesson extracted

**Tier 3: Deep analysis (1-2 pages)**
- Use: When example is central to chapter
- Format: 
  - What the game does
  - How it implements the concept
  - What measurables it optimizes
  - What paradigm/aesthetic it serves
  - What we learn from it
  - What could be improved

**Tier 4: Complete worked example (5+ pages)**
- Use: Once or twice per major chapter
- Format: Full framework application (see Village Mystery + Boss Fight)

### Resource Management Cross-References

**When discussing resources in any chapter:**

**Minimum references:**
- Link to Resource Management chapter for detailed patterns
- Specify resource type (consumable, buffer, accumulation, composition, capacity)
- Note recovery pattern and what it creates (fast → episodic, slow → attrition)

**Example:**
```markdown
Spell slots are consumable resources (consumed when cast) with moderate recovery 
(per long rest), creating per-day strategic allocation. See Resource Management 
chapter for recovery patterns and their effects on play.
```

**When discussing aesthetics + resources:**
- Reference which resource patterns serve which aesthetics
- Example: "Challenge aesthetic typically uses moderate scarcity + moderate recovery"
- Link to Resource Management Part 9 (Aesthetic-to-Resource Mapping)

**When discussing pacing:**
- Note that recovery patterns determine pacing
- Fast recovery → Episodic pacing
- Slow recovery → Attrition pacing
- See Resource Management Part 4 (Recovery Patterns)

**When discussing cognitive load:**
- NEVER call cognitive load a "resource"
- If discussing resource tracking complexity, reference cognitive load as constraint
- Example: "Complex resources increase cognitive load (constraint), not resource expenditure"

**Common Cross-Reference Mistakes:**
```markdown
✗ "Players manage attention resource" → ✓ "Players face attention constraints"
✗ "Time is a resource" → ✓ "Time is a constraint" (unless in-fiction time tracked as mechanic)
✗ Discussing resources without specifying type or recovery pattern
✗ Using Blades but not mentioning stress/harm separation
✗ Using Slay the Spire but not mentioning composition resource pattern
```

**Resource Anti-Pattern References:**
When identifying problems, reference anti-pattern codes:
```markdown
✓ "This creates AP-RM-1 (Critical Path Resources) because..."
✓ "Design avoids AP-RM-4 (Resource Starvation) by providing..."
✗ Describing problem without referencing anti-pattern catalog
```

**Resource-Specific Example Usage:**
- **Blades stress/harm:** Always mention separation + different recovery rates
- **Slay the Spire deck:** Always mention composition (quality > quantity)
- **Catan hand limit:** Always mention forced spending mechanism
- **HoMM3 armies:** Always mention permanent loss + weekly rhythm
- **WoW time-gating:** Note both benefits (pacing) and problems (FOMO)

### Hypothetical Examples

**Format for teaching examples:**
```markdown
**Hypothetical: [Concept Being Illustrated]**

Consider a game where:
- [Setup clearly described]
- [Key variables stated]
- [Problem or question posed]

Analysis:
- [Walk through reasoning]
- [Show calculations if applicable]
- [Arrive at conclusion]

Lesson: [What this teaches us about the concept]
```

**Example of good hypothetical:**
```markdown
**Hypothetical: Recovery Speed Determines Pacing**

Consider a tactical combat game where:
- Players have 100 HP
- Each combat encounter deals ~30 damage
- Question: How does recovery rate affect pacing?

Scenario A (Fast Recovery):
- HP restores to full in 30 seconds after combat
- Result: Each encounter feels self-contained (Episodic pacing)
- Players approach each fight fresh

Scenario B (Slow Recovery):
- HP restores at 5 HP per minute
- Result: Pressure builds across encounters (Attrition pacing)
- Players must manage HP across multiple fights

Lesson: Recovery Speed is the primary determinant of whether pacing 
feels Episodic or Attrition-based.
```

### Test/Validation Examples

**Format for playtesting scenarios:**
```markdown
**Test: [What's Being Validated]**

Setup:
- [Game state described]
- [Parameters tested]
- [Success criteria defined]

Expected Outcome:
- [Hypothesis stated clearly]
- [Metrics to track]

Actual Outcome:
- [What happened in playtest]
- [Data collected]

- [Player complaints]

Why it fails:
- [Underlying issue]
- [Which principle violated]

Fix:
- [Correct approach]
- [How to avoid this mistake]

Example: [Brief real or hypothetical example]
```

### Resource Management Anti-Patterns (From Resource Management Chapter)

**Standard anti-pattern codes for consistent reference across chapters:**

**AP-RM-1: Critical Path Resources**
- Problem: Gating progress-critical elements behind depletable/missable resources
- Example: D&D investigation (roll to find clues → can fail → investigation stalls)
- Why it fails: Creates dead stops, not interesting challenges
- Solution: Core elements automatic, optional elements cost resources (Gumshoe model)
- Recognition: "If players run out of X, can game continue interestingly?" If NO → Don't make it depletable

**AP-RM-2: System Selection Error**
- Problem: Using resource system designed for different aesthetic
- Example: D&D (combat-focused) for mystery investigation (interpretation-focused)
- Why it fails: Mechanics fight against intended experience
- Solution: Choose system that serves aesthetic, or heavily modify
- Recognition: "What is this system optimized for? Does it match my goal?"

**AP-RM-3: Meaningless Accumulation**
- Problem: Resources accumulate without creating decisions
- Example: Grinding for levels (time investment, not skill expression)
- Why it fails: Reduces Challenge to Submission (mindless activity)
- Solution: Tie accumulation to choices, not just time
- Recognition: "Could a bot do this?" If YES → Problem

**AP-RM-4: Resource Starvation**
- Problem: Players can't afford to use core mechanics
- Example: Wizard with 2 spell slots saves them, never casts
- Why it fails: Core fantasy inaccessible, reduces to basic actions
- Solution: Increase abundance or add free baseline version (cantrips)
- Recognition: Playtest shows players hoarding and never using abilities

**AP-RM-5: Unintended Grinding**
- Problem: Optimal play requires repetitive resource farming
- Example: Need gold for potions → farm easy enemies repeatedly
- Why it fails: Interrupts pacing, boring, feels necessary
- Solution: Make farming impossible/inefficient, make resources abundant, or make farming fun
- Recognition: "What's optimal way to get X?" If answer is "repeat boring thing" → Problem

**AP-RM-6: Manipulative FOMO**
- Problem: Creating anxiety through time-limited content for retention metrics
- Example: Daily quest treadmills with exclusive rewards
- Why it fails: Engagement through anxiety, not enjoyment; game becomes job
- Solution: Make events recurring, remove exclusive rewards, no "use it or lose it" pressure
- Recognition: "Does missing this create anxiety or disappointment?" Anxiety → Manipulative

**How to Reference Anti-Patterns:**
```
✓ Correct: "This creates AP-RM-1 (Critical Path Resources) because investigation stalls if players fail..."
✓ Correct: "Avoiding AP-RM-4 (Resource Starvation) by providing abundant cantrips..."
✗ Wrong: Describing anti-pattern without referencing code (readers can't connect to catalog)
✗ Wrong: Inventing new anti-patterns without documenting in guidelines
```

**When Anti-Pattern is Intentional:**
Sometimes what looks like anti-pattern serves aesthetic:
- Resource Starvation in survival horror (tension is the goal)
- Permanent loss in roguelikes (stakes are the point)
- System Selection Error if deliberately genre-bending

**Note:** "This serves the aesthetic" requires explicit justification, not assumption

**Adding New Anti-Patterns:**
1. Propose code (AP-RM-7, AP-RM-8, etc.)
2. Document: Problem, Example, Why it fails, Solution, Recognition test
3. Add to this guidelines document
4. Update Resource Management chapter
5. Note in revision log

## Part 5: Tone and Voice Guidelines

### Overall Voice

**Characteristics:**
- **Practical, not academic** - Focus on "how to do it" not "here's the theory"
- **Confident but humble** - We know what works, but acknowledge limits
- **Specific, not vague** - "Target 20-25 rounds" not "make it balanced"
- **Honest about complexity** - Don't oversimplify, but don't overwhelm

**Avoid:**
- ✗ Lecturing tone ("You must understand that...")
- ✗ Overly casual ("Hey, let's talk about balance!")
- ✗ Defensive hedging ("Maybe possibly this might work...")
- ✗ Marketing speak ("Revolutionary new framework!")

### Addressing the Reader

**Use "you" for direct guidance:**
```markdown
✓ "You should prioritize Pattern Consistency for Challenge aesthetic"
✓ "When you encounter this problem..."
✓ "Ask yourself: what aesthetic am I serving?"
```

**Use "we" for shared understanding:**
```markdown
✓ "We've identified three working paradigms"
✓ "We can see this pattern in Dark Souls"
✓ "Let's examine how this works"
```

**Use "the designer" for general principles:**
```markdown
✓ "The designer must choose between Framework and Consistency"
✓ "Designers often skip this step"
```

**Never use:**
- ✗ "One must consider..." (too formal)
- ✗ "The reader should..." (too distant)
- ✗ "We designers know..." (creates in-group/out-group)

### Technical Explanations

**Complexity ladder:**

1. **Introduce simply** - Core concept in plain language
2. **Provide detail** - Technical explanation with examples
3. **Show application** - Practical use
4. **Reference for depth** - Point to resources for more

**Example:**
```markdown
[Simple] Framework paradigm uses negotiated stakes.

[Detail] The GM and player discuss the action, assign Risk level 
(Controlled/Risky/Desperate) and Effect level (Limited/Standard/Great), 
then roll to determine outcome within that framework.

[Application] When a player says "I sneak past the guard," the GM 
evaluates: How alert is the guard? How prepared is the player? This 
determines if the action is Controlled (+1), Risky (+0), or Desperate (-1).

[Reference] For complete framework application, see Blades in the Dark 
Position and Effect system (Harper, 2017).
```

### Emphasis and Certainty

**Strong claims (use sparingly):**
```markdown
✓ "This will cause problems" (when clearly harmful)
✓ "Pattern Consistency is required for Challenge aesthetic" (when validated)
✓ "This formula always works" (when mathematically certain)
```

**Moderate claims (default):**
```markdown
✓ "This typically works well"
✓ "Most designs benefit from"
✓ "Generally, you should consider"
```

**Tentative claims (when uncertain):**
```markdown
✓ "This might work if..."
✓ "Early testing suggests..."
✓ "One possible approach is..."
```

**When discussing cognitive load specifically:**

**DO emphasize:**
- **Intentionality:** "This HIGH load serves Challenge aesthetic" (not "this is complex")
- **Trade-offs:** "High load creates depth but excludes casual players" (not "make it simpler")
- **Support strategies:** "Externalize this with reference cards" (not "players will figure it out")
- **Player differences:** "Achievers want this, Socializers don't" (not "players will struggle")
- **Appropriateness:** "Load matches aesthetic" or "load mismatches aesthetic" (not "well-designed" or "poorly-designed")

**DON'T imply:**
- Load is inherently bad: "Too complex" → "Complex for Fellowship aesthetic"
- One solution fits all: "Simplify" → "Match load to audience/aesthetic"
- Players are uniform: "Players will struggle" → "Some players (Socializers) will struggle, others (Achievers) will enjoy"
- Designers control everything: "Ensure players understand" → "Support understanding through tools/UI"
- Complexity equals depth: "More mechanics = more interesting" → "Appropriate complexity for aesthetic"

**Examples of good framing:**
```markdown
✓ "HIGH simultaneity load serves Challenge aesthetic in StarCraft"
✓ "Fellowship aesthet requires LOW mechanical load (brainspace for socializing)"
✓ "This tracking load can be offloaded to character sheets"
✓ "Achievers want conquerable high load; Socializers prefer low mechanical load"
✓ "Load mismatch: meditative gameplay + complex systems (Death Stranding)"

✗ "This game is too complex" (for whom? in what way?)
✗ "Simplify your design" (why? which load? which aesthetic?)
✗ "Players can't handle this" (which players? all players?)
✗ "Make it easier to understand" (how? externalize? simplify? support?)
✗ "This is well-designed" (according to what criteria? which aesthetic?)
```

**Frame load as design choice, not problem:**
```markdown
✓ "Choose HIGH decision load for Challenge aesthetic"
✓ "Choose LOW tracking load for Fellowship aesthetic"
✓ "Choose pattern recognition load for Mastery aesthetic"

✗ "Avoid high complexity" (when? why? for which aesthetic?)
✗ "Keep it simple" (how simple? for which audience?)
✗ "Don't overwhelm players" (depends on audience and aesthetic)
```
✓ "Generally, you should"
```

**Tentative claims (when appropriate):**
```markdown
✓ "This might work if..."
✓ "Consider trying..."
✓ "One approach is..."
```

**Caveats (when needed):**
```markdown
✓ "This works for small-to-medium games, but League-scale requires different approaches"
✓ "Framework provides structure, but doesn't eliminate judgment"
✓ "First-pass numbers will likely be 20-50% off"
```

### Encouragement vs. Warning

**Encourage experimentation:**
```markdown
✓ "Try different approaches and see what works"
✓ "Your first numbers will be wrong—that's expected and okay"
✓ "Iterate based on playtesting feedback"
```

**Warn about pitfalls:**
```markdown
✓ "Avoid X because it causes Y"
✓ "If you see Z, stop and reassess"
✓ "This is a common mistake that breaks balance"
```

**Balance optimism and realism:**
```markdown
✓ Good: "Framework gets you close; playtesting fine-tunes"
✗ Too optimistic: "Framework gives you perfect numbers!"
✗ Too pessimistic: "Balance is impossible, you'll never get it right"
```

## Part 6: LLM Integration Approach

### When to Mention LLMs

**Appropriate contexts:**
1. **As design assistance tool** (calculate probabilities, simulate outcomes)
2. **For rapid prototyping** (generate content variations to test)
3. **For playtesting simulation** (run 100 virtual playthroughs)
4. **For analysis** (identify patterns in large datasets)

**Inappropriate contexts:**
1. ✗ As replacement for designer judgment
2. ✗ As source of aesthetic goals
3. ✗ As arbiter of "what's fun"
4. ✗ As excuse for not playtesting with real humans

### How to Frame LLM Use

**Standard framing template:**
```markdown
**LLMs can help with:** [Specific task clearly defined]

**How to use:**
1. [Step-by-step process]
2. [What to prompt for]
3. [How to validate output]

**What LLMs can't do:** [Clear limitations]

**Human still decides:** [What requires judgment]
```

**Example from Balance chapter:**
```markdown
**LLMs can help with:** Simulating many playthroughs

Ask LLM to simulate:
- 100 boss fights with given parameters
- Track win rate, average duration, cause of death
- Identify edge cases or exploits

What LLMs can't do: Judge subjective "feel"
- Does 65% hit rate feel good? (Need playtesting)
- Is consequence satisfying? (Need player feedback)

Human still decides: Whether math translates to fun
```

### LLM Prompt Templates

**When providing prompts, use this format:**
```markdown
**Prompt Template: [Purpose]**

```
[Prompt text in code block, with [VARIABLES] marked clearly]
```

**Example usage:**
- Replace [VARIABLE] with your specific values
- Adjust for your context
- Validate output before using

**What to expect:**
- [Typical output format]
- [Accuracy limitations]
- [When to rerun with adjustments]
```

### Caveats and Limitations

**Always include when discussing LLM use:**

1. **Validation required** - "Always validate LLM output with human judgment"
2. **Iteration expected** - "First prompt rarely gives perfect output; refine iteratively"
3. **Hallucination warning** - "LLMs may confidently state false information; verify critical details"
4. **Context limits** - "LLMs have limited context; may need multiple prompts for complex tasks"
5. **Not a substitute** - "LLM assistance supplements, doesn't replace, design thinking"

### Evolving Technology Note

**Include in chapters with significant LLM content:**
```markdown
**Note on LLM Technology:** This chapter references LLM capabilities as of [DATE]. 
As LLM technology evolves, specific capabilities may change. The principles of 
human judgment, validation, and iteration remain regardless of tool capabilities.
```

### LLM and Cognitive Load **[NEW]**

**LLMs have complex relationship with cognitive load:**

**LLMs can REDUCE cognitive load by:**
- **State tracking and memory management** (character history, NPC relationships, world state)
- **Just-in-time information surfacing** (reminders when relevant, not constant overload)
- **Content generation** (descriptions, complications, adaptive responses)
- **Consistency maintenance** (tone, themes, world logic across sessions)

**LLMs can INCREASE cognitive load by:**
- **Choice paralysis** (generating too many options without clear framework)
- **Ambiguity** (unclear what's possible, no explicit rules to reference)
- **Trust issues** (inconsistency breaks immersion, requires mental validation)
- **Meta-cognition** (figuring out how to interact with LLM is its own cognitive task)

**When writing about LLM integration, ALWAYS specify:**

**1. Which load types does LLM reduce?**
```markdown
✓ "LLM reduces memory load (tracks NPC relationships)"
✓ "LLM reduces tracking load (maintains world state invisibly)"
✗ "LLM reduces complexity" (which type? how?)
✗ "LLM makes game easier" (easier how? for which aesthetic?)
```

**2. Which load types can LLM NOT handle?**
```markdown
✓ "LLM cannot handle calculation load reliably (use explicit formulas)"
✓ "LLM cannot guarantee perfect consistency (use data structures for critical state)"
✗ "LLM handles everything except..." (be specific)
✗ "LLM can't do complex math" (without explaining alternative)
```

**3. Hybrid approaches (LLM + explicit systems):**
```markdown
✓ "LLM generates NPC dialogue; explicit system tracks reputation points"
✓ "LLM creates complications; system determines when complications trigger"
✗ "Use LLM and system together" (how? which does what?)
```

**4. Failure modes and mitigation:**
```markdown
✓ "If LLM generates inconsistent NPC, players notice: use explicit NPC fact sheet to constrain LLM"
✓ "If LLM creates choice paralysis, limit to 3-5 options maximum"
✗ "LLM might fail sometimes" (how? what happens? what to do?)
```

**Mark LLM roles clearly in designs:**
```markdown
[LLM_PRIMARY]: Core LLM responsibility (NPC behavior, atmosphere)
[LLM_SUPPORT]: Supporting role (quick reference, suggestions)  
[EXPLICIT_SYSTEM]: NOT LLM (rules, calculations, balance)
[HYBRID]: Both LLM and system (generation + validation)
```

**Example integration description:**
```markdown
**Memory Management System:**
- [EXPLICIT_SYSTEM]: Character sheet tracks stats, inventory (simple data)
- [LLM_PRIMARY]: Character journal tracks narrative events, relationships (complex state)
- [HYBRID]: Quest log - LLM generates quest descriptions, system tracks completion state
- Result: Players don't need to remember session-to-session details (memory load offloaded)

**But note:** 
- LLM might forget details outside context window (use explicit data for critical info)
- Players must trust LLM consistency (if NPC acts out of character, breaks immersion)
```

**DON'T assume:**
- ✗ LLMs always reduce load (they can add choice paralysis, ambiguity, trust issues)
- ✗ LLMs can handle everything (math, perfect memory, transparency all problematic)
- ✗ Players will trust LLM (some find it "uncanny valley" or unreliable)
- ✗ LLM integration is simple (requires careful design of what LLM handles vs. system)

## Part 7: Cross-Chapter Validation

### Assumption Tracking

**Create assumptions document (separate file) tracking:**

```markdown
# Core Assumptions Requiring Validation

## Aesthetics List
**Assumption:** MDA + 4 expansions covers all game experiences
**Chapters relying on this:** All (foundation)
**Validation needed when:** 
- New chapter analyzes game that doesn't fit aesthetics
- Multiple chapters find same aesthetic insufficient
**Revision impact:** HIGH (must update all chapters)
**Status:** STABLE as of [DATE]

## Paradigms Model
**Assumption:** Three paradigms (Framework, Consistency, Adaptive) cover all balance approaches
**Chapters relying on this:** Balance, potentially others
**Validation needed when:**
- Game doesn't fit any paradigm
- Paradigm distinctions break down in practice
**Revision impact:** HIGH (must update Balance chapter)
**Status:** STABLE as of [DATE]

## Pacing as Emergent
**Assumption:** Pacing is emergent from temporal dynamics, not separate system
**Chapters relying on this:** Balance, potentially Resources
**Validation needed when:**
- Pacing requires separate mechanisms
- Emergent framing insufficient for design
**Revision impact:** MEDIUM (must update Balance chapter, possibly add Pacing chapter)
**Status:** STABLE as of [DATE]

## Cognitive Load as Constraint
**Assumption:** Cognitive load is external constraint (not in-game resource)
**Chapters relying on this:** All chapters (touches every design decision)
**Validation needed when:**
- System treats cognitive load as spendable resource
- Load-resource distinction breaks down
**Revision impact:** CRITICAL (foundational distinction)
**Status:** STABLE as of [DATE]

[Continue for each major assumption...]
```

### Cognitive Load Cross-Chapter Dependencies **[NEW - CRITICAL]**

**Core principle:** Cognitive load affects (and is affected by) every other game system. This is not a separate concern—it's woven through all design decisions.

**Dependencies to validate:**

**Resources ↔ Cognitive Load:**
- More resources = more tracking load (must monitor each separately)
- Complex resource interactions = higher decision load (optimization calculations)
- Resource scarcity = higher decision load (must choose carefully when to spend)
- **Validation check:** Does resource chapter account for cognitive overhead of each resource?
- **Design question:** "Is this resource worth the cognitive cost it creates?"

**Balance ↔ Cognitive Load:**
- Balance must be PERCEIVABLE (players must comprehend it cognitively)
- High-load options feel weaker (execution difficulty = practical cost)
- Balanced system meaningless if too complex to understand
- Different skill levels = different load = different effective balance
- **Validation check:** Does balance analysis include "can players perceive this balance?"
- **Design question:** "Is this balance comprehensible to target audience?"

**Aesthetics ↔ Cognitive Load:**
- Challenge aesthetic requires HIGH (but conquerable) load
- Fellowship aesthetic requires LOW mechanical load (brainspace for socializing)
- Narrative aesthetic requires load NOT in calculation (math breaks immersion)
- Mastery aesthetic requires load that REVEALS depth over time
- Discovery aesthetic tolerates "messy" load (complexity for exploration)
- **Validation check:** Does aesthetic guidance specify appropriate load profile?
- **Design question:** "Does this load serve the intended aesthetic?"

**Pacing ↔ Cognitive Load:**
- Real-time = higher simultaneity load (time pressure multiplies complexity)
- Turn-based = can handle more decision/calculation load (time to think)
- Recovery periods = cognitive rest (not just resource recovery)
- Load accumulation affects session length tolerance
- **Validation check:** Does pacing analysis account for cognitive fatigue?
- **Design question:** "Can players sustain this load for intended session length?"

**Player Types ↔ Cognitive Load:**
- Achievers want conquerable high load (mastery through optimization)
- Explorers tolerate messy load (discovery-driven)
- Socializers want low mechanical load (brainspace for interaction)
- Killers embrace competitive load (management as advantage)
- **Validation check:** Does player type analysis include load preferences?
- **Design question:** "Which player types will this load profile serve/exclude?"

**LLM Integration ↔ Cognitive Load:**
- LLMs can REDUCE: memory load, tracking load, state management
- LLMs can INCREASE: choice paralysis, ambiguity, trust load
- Hybrid approaches balance load types (LLM + explicit systems)
- **Validation check:** Does LLM integration specify load impact (reduce/increase which types)?
- **Design question:** "Does LLM reduce net cognitive load, or shift/add it?"

### Cross-Chapter Validation Protocol

**When writing any chapter, check:**

1. **What cognitive load does this create?**
   - Rate each type: Simultaneity, Decision, Memory, Tracking, Calculation, Pattern, Social
   - Justify HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW for each

2. **How does this interact with other systems?**
   - Resources: Does this add tracking/decision load?
   - Balance: Is this balance perceivable given load?
   - Aesthetics: Does load match aesthetic intent?
   - Pacing: Can players sustain this load over session?
   - Player types: Who does this serve/exclude?

3. **Are there load conflicts?**
   - Multiple systems compound load (total may be overwhelming)
   - Load types compete (can't focus on decisions if tracking is overwhelming)
   - Load-aesthetic mismatch (Fellowship + high mechanical load = conflict)

4. **How can load be managed?**
   - Support necessary load (tools, UI, externalization)
   - Remove unnecessary load (simplification, automation)
   - Offload strategically (GM, computer, LLM)
   - Distribute if multiplayer (cooperative load sharing)

5. **What happens at different skill levels?**
   - Beginners: Is initial load manageable?
   - Intermediates: Does load scale with learning?
   - Experts: Does mastery reduce or reveal load?

**Chapter-specific validation questions:**

**Resources chapter:**
- [ ] How many resources can target audience track simultaneously?
- [ ] Does each resource justify its cognitive overhead?
- [ ] Can tracking be offloaded (tokens, sheets, automation)?
- [ ] Do resource interactions create combinatorial explosion?

**Balance chapter:**
- [ ] Can players perceive the balance without calculators?
- [ ] Do high-load options feel weaker (execution difficulty cost)?
- [ ] Is system balanced at multiple skill levels (as load changes)?
- [ ] Can players evaluate trade-offs during play?

**Aesthetics chapter:**
- [ ] Does each aesthetic have appropriate load profile specified?
- [ ] Are load-aesthetic conflicts identified?
- [ ] Do examples include cognitive load analysis?

**Pacing chapter:**
- [ ] Does pacing account for cognitive fatigue?
- [ ] Are recovery periods cognitive rest (not just resource recovery)?
- [ ] Does real-time vs. turn-based affect load recommendations?

**LLM Integration chapter:**
- [ ] Which load types does LLM reduce? Increase?
- [ ] Are hybrid approaches (LLM + system) specified?
- [ ] Are failure modes and load impacts described?

### When Assumptions Conflict

**Protocol:**

1. **Document the conflict**
   - Which chapter reveals problem?
   - What doesn't fit existing framework?
   - Is it edge case or fundamental issue?

2. **Assess impact**
   - How many chapters affected?
   - Is quick fix possible or need reconceptualization?
   - What's cost of change vs. cost of workaround?

3. **Propose solution**
   - Extend existing framework (add aesthetic, paradigm, etc.)
   - Refine definitions (clarify boundaries)
   - Replace framework (if fundamentally broken)

4. **Validate solution**
   - Does it solve original problem?
   - Does it maintain coherence with other chapters?
   - Does it create new problems?

5. **Implement changes**
   - Update assumptions document
   - Create checklist of affected chapters
   - Make changes systematically
   - Review for consistency

6. **Document rationale**
   - Why change was needed
   - What alternatives were considered
   - What impact on existing chapters
   - Date of change for future reference

### Cross-Chapter Consistency Checks

**Regular validation (before publishing):**

**Terminology audit:**
- Search for "aesthetic" - are all references using same 12?
- Search for "paradigm" - are all references using same 3?
- Search for "pacing" - is emergent framing maintained?
- Search for "resource" - is classification consistent?

**Conceptual coherence:**
- Do all chapters treat aesthetics as primary driver?
- Do all chapters respect paradigm distinctions?
- Do cross-references make sense bidirectionally?

**Example consistency:**
- Is Dark Souls always Consistency + Challenge?
- Is Blades always Framework + Narrative?
- Are examples used consistently across chapters?

**Checklist template:**
```markdown
# Consistency Check: [Chapter Name]

## Terminology
- [ ] Uses canonical 12 aesthetics (MDA + 4)

## Fully Analyzed Games

**Blades in the Dark** (2017, Tabletop RPG, Narrative)
- **Primary Aesthetic:** Narrative
- **Secondary Aesthetics:** Tension, Fellowship
- **Balance Paradigm:** Framework (Position/Effect system)
- **Pacing Pattern:** Wave (score structure: prep → execution → consequences → downtime)
- **Key Design Choice:** Negotiated stakes make consequences meaningful while keeping story moving forward
- **Chapter(s) Analyzing:** Balance (Part 2, Part 4)
- **Analysis Depth:** Deep
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Framework enables unpredictable player creativity
  - 3 tiers per dimension (Position, Effect) optimal
  - Partial success (7-9) critical for narrative flow
  - Stress/Harm separation creates character arc through play
- **Status:** Useful (canonical Framework example)

**Dark Souls** (2011, Multi-platform, Action RPG)
- **Primary Aesthetic:** Challenge
- **Secondary Aesthetics:** Mastery, Tension
- **Balance Paradigm:** Consistency (fixed enemy stats and patterns)
- **Pacing Pattern:** Episodic (bonfire-to-bonfire segments) with Attrition overlay (souls/humanity management)
- **Key Design Choice:** Fixed patterns enable mastery through repetition, high consequence severity makes victories meaningful
- **Chapter(s) Analyzing:** Balance (Part 2, Part 4, Recipe 1)
- **Analysis Depth:** Deep
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Consistency requires high consequence severity (mistakes must hurt)
  - Pattern learning is satisfying but excludes some players
  - Bonfire placement controls difficulty pacing
  - Optional summons add bounded adaptive element
- **Status:** Useful (canonical Consistency example)

**Left 4 Dead 2** (2009, Multi-platform, Co-op FPS)
- **Primary Aesthetic:** Fellowship
- **Secondary Aesthetics:** Tension, Challenge
- **Balance Paradigm:** Adaptive (AI Director manages spawns and items)
- **Pacing Pattern:** Wave (explicit build-up → peak → relax cycles every 2-3 minutes)
- **Key Design Choice:** AI Director adjusts difficulty based on team performance while maintaining dramatic pacing
- **Chapter(s) Analyzing:** Balance (Part 2, Part 4, Recipe 3)
- **Analysis Depth:** Deep
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Adaptive must be subtle (too obvious feels patronizing/cheating)
  - Bounds critical (spawn rate 1-10, not 0-100)
  - Pacing cycles must include relief phases
  - Cooperation must be mechanically enforced (punish lone wolves)
- **Status:** Useful (canonical Adaptive example)

**AI Dungeon** (2019, Web, Text Adventure)
- **Primary Aesthetic:** Discovery (attempted), Narrative (attempted)
- **Secondary Aesthetics:** Expression (attempted)
- **Balance Paradigm:** None (pure LLM generation)
- **Pacing Pattern:** Continuous (intended player-controlled but no structure)
- **Key Design Choice:** Pure LLM narrative generation without mechanical constraints
- **Chapter(s) Analyzing:** Balance (Part 4)
- **Analysis Depth:** Medium (cautionary tale)
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Unconstrained LLM generation leads to stakes evaporation
  - Mechanical layer mandatory even for narrative games
  - LLMs don't maintain consistent state (need explicit tracking)
  - Infinite retries kill stakes
- **Status:** Useful (what NOT to do, validates framework necessity)

- Key points:
  - Stress (buffer, fast recovery) vs. Harm (consequence, slow recovery)
  - Different recovery rates create strategic layers
  - Creates "grizzled veteran" narrative arc through trauma accumulation
  - Personal (stress/harm) vs. shared (coin/rep) resource mix
- Status: Useful for buffer resources, mixed recovery (canonical example)

**Settlers of Catan** (1995, Board Game)
- Used in: Resource Management chapter (detailed analysis)
- Primary Aesthetic: Fellowship, Challenge (light)

  - Rubber-band mechanics (leader is most vulnerable)
- Status: Useful for anti-hoarding design, Fellowship aesthetic resources (canonical example)

**Heroes of Might and Magic III** (1999, PC Strategy)
- Used in: Resource Management chapter (detailed analysis)
- Primary Aesthetic: Challenge, Mastery, Progression
- Key Resource Innovation: Permanent unit loss creates stakes
- Key points:
  - Army units permanent loss (no recovery)
  - Weekly production creates campaign rhythm
  - Resource chains (mine → resource → building → unit)
  - Distinction between consumable (units) and persistent (hero levels)
- Status: Useful for permanent loss, attrition pacing (canonical example)

**World of Warcraft** (2004-present, MMO)
- Used in: Resource Management chapter (medium analysis)
- Primary Aesthetic: Progression, Fellowship, Challenge
- Key Resource Innovation: Time-gated progression, social dependencies
- Key points:
  - Fast HP recovery enables continuous play
  - Multiple parallel progression systems (currencies, reputation)
  - Time-gated resources control progression speed (but create FOMO)
  - Evolution toward accessibility (Classic vs. Modern)
- Status: Useful for time-gating patterns (both good and bad)

**Type:** Core Revision
**Impact:** HIGH (affects all chapters)
**Changes:**
- Added 13th aesthetic: [Name]
- Revised [Existing Aesthetic] definition
- Updated all aesthetic-paradigm mappings

**Rationale:** [Why change needed]

**Affected Chapters:** All chapters referencing aesthetics

**Migration Notes:**
- All chapters must update aesthetic lists
- Recipes must be checked for new aesthetic fit
- Examples must be re-categorized if needed

[Continue for each major change...]
```

### Change Impact Assessment

**Use this framework to assess any major change:**

**Impact Level:**
- **LOW:** Affects single section of single chapter, no concept changes
- **MEDIUM:** Affects multiple sections or 2-3 chapters, refinement of existing concepts
- **HIGH:** Affects core concepts, requires updates across 4+ chapters
- **CRITICAL:** Changes foundational assumptions, requires rewrite of multiple chapters

**Migration Complexity:**
- **SIMPLE:** Find-and-replace terminology
- **MODERATE:** Rewrite sections with updated concepts
- **COMPLEX:** Reconceptualize and validate across all chapters

**Before implementing HIGH or CRITICAL changes:**
1. Document complete impact assessment
2. Create migration plan with chapter-by-chapter checklist
3. Implement changes systematically (don't leave in half-updated state)
4. Validate consistency after changes
5. Update all cross-references
6. Run consistency checks

## Summary: Why These Guidelines Matter

**Coherence at scale:**
- Book will have 10-15 chapters
- Multiple authors may contribute
- Revision cycles will span months/years
- Readers will read non-sequentially

**Without guidelines:**
- ✗ Aesthetics list drifts (8 in one chapter, 12 in another, 15 in another)
- ✗ Examples contradict (Dark Souls is Challenge here, Mastery there)
- ✗ Terminology varies ("metric" vs "measurable" confusion)
- ✗ Structure inconsistent (hard to navigate)
- ✗ Tone shifts (academic here, casual there)
- ✗ Assumptions conflict (pacing is emergent vs. pacing is separate system)

**With guidelines:**
- ✓ Consistent conceptual foundation across all chapters
- ✓ Predictable structure helps readers navigate
- ✓ Examples reinforce each other instead of contradicting
- ✓ Terminology enables precise communication
- ✓ Tone maintains professionalism and clarity
- ✓ Changes propagate systematically when needed

**This document is the book's DNA** - the encoding of what makes it coherent as it grows.

Use it. Maintain it. Evolve it when necessary. The quality of the final book depends on it.
