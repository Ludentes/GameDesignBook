# Task: Update Writing Guidelines - Context Chapter Integration

## Purpose
Integrate lessons and patterns from Context chapter development into the book's Writing Guidelines to ensure consistency across all future chapters.

---

## Section 1: Core Concepts to Add

### 1.1 Context Framework (New Addition)

**Add to Part 1 (Core Conceptual Commitments):**

#### Context Design Framework

**Definition:** Context is the framing, setting, tone, and thematic elements that give mechanics meaning. It includes genre (load-bearing structure) and dressing (cosmetic layer).

**Core Distinction:**
- **Genre:** The structural type that determines mechanics and experience (mystery investigation, horror survival, political thriller, etc.)
- **Dressing:** The cosmetic layer that can often be swapped (Star Wars, medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, etc.)

**The Three Layers:**
1. **Perspective:** The overall feeling/framing being maintained (unknowable threat, solvable puzzle, cosmic wonder, safe comfort)
2. **Build/Suggest/Omit:** Strategic detail decisions about what to show explicitly, hint at, or deliberately leave mysterious
3. **Dynamics:** The behaviors that emerge when players interact with mechanics within context

**How to Reference:**
```
✓ Correct: "The genre (mystery investigation) is load-bearing; the dressing (Victorian London) is cosmetic"
✓ Correct: "Maintain perspective throughout - every element must serve the overall feeling"
✓ Correct: "Build what's mechanically necessary, Suggest what enables investigation, Omit what breaks perspective"
✗ Wrong: "Setting" without distinguishing genre from dressing
✗ Wrong: "Context is just worldbuilding" (ignores perspective and framing)
✗ Wrong: Using specific designer names in principles (e.g., "Twohy Principle" - use descriptive names instead)
```

**When to Revise:**
- If genre/dressing distinction proves insufficient for new game types
- If Build/Suggest/Omit framework needs additional categories
- If perspective maintenance requires more structured guidance

**Current Status:** STABLE (validated through Context chapter development)

---

### 1.2 Dynamics Framework (Enhancement)

**Update existing Dynamics references:**

**Current state:** Dynamics mentioned but not systematically defined across chapters
**Needed state:** Consistent understanding of dynamics as behavioral layer

**Definition to use consistently:**
Dynamics are the behaviors that emerge when players interact with mechanics within context. Not what players CAN do (mechanics), but what they DO do (behavior).

**Framework chain:**
```
Mechanics (rules) 
    + Context (framing) 
    → Dynamics (behavior) 
    → Aesthetics (experience)
```

**Examples to cite consistently:**
- Weather Factory: Same mechanics + different context = different dynamics (careful vs exploratory)
- Star Wars universes: Same dressing + different genre = different dynamics (hero's journey vs war vs political thriller)

**Where to add:**
- Chapter 1: Enhance existing dynamics discussion with context interaction
- Resource Chapter: How resource mechanics create behavioral dynamics
- Balance Chapter: How paradigm choice affects competitive dynamics
- Context Chapter: How context shapes which dynamics emerge (already done)
- Synthesis Chapter: How all systems interact to create complex dynamics

---

## Section 2: Terminology Standards

### 2.1 New Mandatory Terms

**Add to Part 2 (Terminology Standards):**

#### Context-Specific Terms

**Genre (mandatory):**
- Use for: Load-bearing structural type
- Not: "Setting" or "theme" when referring to structural experience
- Examples: Mystery investigation, horror survival, political thriller, tactical combat, cozy life sim
- Correct: "The genre (war movie) determines mechanics needed"
- Wrong: "The setting is war" (ambiguous - genre or dressing?)

**Dressing (mandatory):**
- Use for: Cosmetic layer, often swappable
- Not: "Theme" or "aesthetic" (conflicts with MDA aesthetics)
- Examples: Star Wars, medieval fantasy, cyberpunk, Victorian London
- Correct: "The dressing (Star Wars) can be applied to multiple genres"
- Wrong: "The theme is Star Wars" (confuses with thematic content)

**Perspective (mandatory in Context discussions):**
- Use for: Overall feeling/framing being maintained
- Examples: "Unknowable threat," "Solvable puzzle," "Safe comfort"
- Correct: "Every element must serve the perspective"
- Wrong: "Point of view" (too narrow, implies camera angle)

**Build/Suggest/Omit (mandatory for detail decisions):**
- Use for: Strategic detail decisions
- Build = explicit detail
- Suggest = fragments and hints
- Omit = deliberately absent/mysterious
- Correct: "Build mechanically necessary facts, Suggest optional depth, Omit perspective-breaking information"
- Wrong: "Show/hint/hide" (less precise)

### 2.2 Consistency Checks

**Cross-chapter usage:**
- Genre vs Setting: Always distinguish when discussing structural vs cosmetic
- Context vs Worldbuilding: Context includes framing/perspective, worldbuilding is craft execution
- Dynamics consistently: Behavioral layer, not mechanical layer
- Perspective consistently: Overall feeling, not just narrative perspective

---

## Section 3: Example Usage Patterns

### 3.1 Genre/Dressing Examples

**Add to Part 4 (Examples and Analysis):**

**Canonical Genre/Dressing Separations:**

**Star Wars trilogy (established in Context chapter):**
- Original Trilogy: Hero's journey genre, space opera dressing
- Rogue One: War movie genre, Star Wars dressing
- Andor: Political thriller genre, Star Wars dressing

**Blades in the Dark (established in Balance chapter):**
- Genre: Heist with consequences
- Dressing: Victorian haunted city
- Can reskin: Cyberpunk (The Sprawl), Sci-fi (Scum & Villainy)
- Dressing swappable, genre mechanics required

**Weather Factory (established in Context chapter):**
- Cultist Simulator: Discovery + Tension aesthetics, occult horror genre
- Book of Hours: Submission + Discovery aesthetics, cozy restoration genre
- Same mechanics, different genre/dressing, opposite experiences

**When citing games:**
- Always identify both genre AND dressing when relevant
- Don't assume readers know which is load-bearing
- Test by asking: "Could you swap this element without changing experience?"

---

### 3.2 Build/Suggest/Omit Examples

**Add canonical examples to Part 4:**

**Outer Wilds:**
- Build: Physics rules, planet contents, ship logs
- Suggest: Nomai story (fragments across planets), quantum phenomena (experienced not explained)
- Omit: Nomai appearance, some final cosmic mysteries

**Obra Dinn:**
- Build: Death scenes, dialogue, physical evidence
- Suggest: Identities (deduced from clues), relationships
- Omit: Full faces often, complete backstories

**Weather Factory:**
- Build: Card mechanics, immediate effects
- Suggest: Cosmology (fragments in card text), deeper lore
- Omit: Character appearance, complete answers, final mysteries

**Disco Elysium:**
- Build: Martinaise (exhaustively detailed district)
- Suggest: Your past (pieced together), motivations
- Omit: World outside Martinaise, easy redemption

**Use these consistently when illustrating Build/Suggest/Omit decisions.**

---

## Section 4: Cross-Chapter References

### 4.1 New Reference Patterns

**Add to Part 2 (Cross-References):**

**When discussing Context, reference:**
- Chapter 1: Aesthetic framework (what experience to create)
- Chapter 2: Resources (what resources fit context)
- Chapter 3: Cognitive Load (what complexity budget context supports)
- Chapter 4: Balance (what paradigm fits genre)
- Context Chapter: Genre/dressing, perspective, Build/Suggest/Omit

**When discussing Dynamics, reference:**
- Chapter 1: MDA framework (Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics)
- Context Chapter: How context shapes dynamics
- Resource Chapter: How resource mechanics create behavioral dynamics
- Balance Chapter: How paradigm affects dynamics
- Synthesis Chapter: How all systems create complex emergent dynamics

**Standard phrasing:**
```
"For context design guidance, see Context Chapter (Genre selection, Build/Suggest/Omit framework)"
"For how context affects resource choice, see Resource Chapter (Aesthetic Alignment section)"
"For dynamics and behavioral emergence, see Context Chapter Part 7"
```

---

### 4.2 Integration Points to Document

**Chapters that now need Context references:**

**Chapter 1 (What Is a Game System):**
- Add: Genre/dressing distinction in Component 3 (Context)
- Add: Dynamics discussion should reference context's role
- Note: Context chapter goes deeper on these topics

**Chapter 2 (Resource Management):**
- Add: Resources must fit context (not just aesthetic)
- Example: Horror context needs stress/dread, cozy context doesn't
- Reference: Context Chapter for genre selection

**Chapter 3 (Cognitive Load):**
- Add: Context affects cognitive load (familiar vs alien, simple vs complex world)
- Example: Cozy genre needs low load, Mystery genre can support medium load
- Reference: Context Chapter Part 6 (Integration)

**Chapter 4 (Balance):**
- Add: Genre determines paradigm fit
- Example: Mystery genre → Framework paradigm (investigation flexibility)
- Example: Horror genre → Consistency or Adaptive (depending on approach)
- Reference: Context Chapter Part 2 (Genre selection)

---

## Section 5: Canonical Game Analysis Updates

### 5.1 Add Context Analysis Layer

**Update Part 8 (Canonical Games) with:**

**For each analyzed game, document:**
- Genre (load-bearing structure)
- Dressing (cosmetic layer)
- Perspective maintained
- Build/Suggest/Omit ratio
- How context creates dynamics
- Integration with mechanics/resources/balance

**Weather Factory (add to canonical list):**
- **Games:** Cultist Simulator (2018), Book of Hours (2023)
- **Genre:** Occult horror vs Cozy restoration
- **Key Insight:** Same mechanics, different context = opposite experiences
- **Perspective:** Paranoid investigation vs Peaceful discovery
- **Build/Suggest/Omit:** Both use high Suggest (fragments), different Omit (horror hides more)
- **Canonical for:** Context transformation, perspective maintenance, Build/Suggest/Omit decisions

**Outer Wilds (add context layer):**
- **Genre:** Space exploration mystery
- **Dressing:** Cartoon aesthetic, hand-crafted solar system
- **Perspective:** Cosmic wonder and tragedy
- **Build/Suggest/Omit:** Build physics, Suggest Nomai story, Omit final mysteries
- **Canonical for:** Discovery aesthetic, strategic restraint, time-loop structure

**Obra Dinn (add context layer):**
- **Genre:** Deductive mystery
- **Dressing:** 1-bit dithered maritime historical
- **Perspective:** Solvable logical puzzle
- **Build/Suggest/Omit:** Build evidence, Suggest identities through clues, Omit some faces
- **Canonical for:** Mystery investigation, deduction mechanics, restraint in presentation

---

### 5.2 Star Wars as Canonical Example

**Add to Part 8:**

**Star Wars (franchise) - Genre/Dressing Separation:**
- **Canonical for:** Demonstrating genre vs dressing distinction
- **Analysis:**
  - Original Trilogy (1977-1983): Hero's journey genre
  - Rogue One (2016): War movie genre
  - Andor (2022): Political thriller genre
  - Same universe (dressing), different genres (structure)
  - Each needs different mechanics to succeed
- **Design Lesson:** "Star Wars game" is insufficient - must specify genre
- **Use when:** Explaining why same IP can need completely different systems

---

## Section 6: Writing Style Updates

### 6.1 Avoid Designer Name Principles

**Add to Part 5 (Tone and Voice):**

**Principle Names:**
- ✗ Avoid: "The Twohy Principle" "The Koster Rule" "Crawford's Law"
- ✓ Use: Descriptive names that explain the concept
- Example: Instead of "Twohy Principle" → "Strategic Restraint" or "Build/Suggest/Omit Framework"
- Reason: Names are opaque to readers, descriptions are clear

**Exception:** Well-established framework names (MDA, Bartle taxonomy) where the name IS the standard term

**When citing influences:**
- ✓ "As David Twohy noted in the Pitch Black screenplay..." (attribution in explanation)
- ✗ "Using the Twohy Principle..." (name as if it's standard terminology)

---

### 6.2 Example Density in Context Discussions

**Add guideline:**

**When discussing context:**
- Always provide concrete examples (not just abstract principles)
- Use canonical games consistently (Weather Factory, Outer Wilds, Star Wars)
- Show both success (what works) and failure (what breaks)
- Demonstrate same concept across different genres

**Pattern:**
1. State principle
2. Show example that works (Weather Factory)
3. Show counter-example that fails (Andromeda)
4. Explain why (perspective maintained vs broken)

**Example density:**
- Complex concepts: 2-3 examples minimum
- New frameworks: Examples from multiple genres
- Anti-patterns: Always show what goes wrong AND how to fix

---

## Section 7: Chapter Structure Updates

### 7.1 Add Context Chapter Structure Pattern

**Document in Part 3 (Chapter Structure):**

**Context Chapter established pattern:**
1. Introduction (why this matters, what we cover)
2. Decision framework (how to choose)
3. Validation framework (how to test)
4. Strategic framework (how to decide details)
5. Practical framework (how to create)
6. Integration (how it connects)
7. Dynamics (how it creates behavior)
8. Coherence (how everything aligns)
9. Validation (how to test it works)
10. Pitfalls (common mistakes)
11. Quick Reference (practical tools)

**This pattern works for:**
- Topics with decision trees (choice frameworks)
- Topics with creative output (design documents)
- Topics requiring integration (cross-system topics)
- Topics with common mistakes (need anti-patterns)

**May not work for:**
- Pure mechanical topics (might need different structure)
- Highly technical topics (might need more math, less framework)

---

### 7.2 Quick Reference Section Standard

**All chapters should include Quick Reference section:**

**Standard components:**
1. One-page process summary
2. Decision flowcharts/matrices
3. Templates (if applicable)
4. Checklists
5. When-to-use-what guidance
6. Common patterns
7. Validation quick checks

**Context chapter provides template for this structure.**

---

## Section 8: Confidence Markers Update

### 8.1 New Frameworks Validation Status

**Add to Part 1 (Core Concepts):**

**Genre/Dressing Distinction:**
- Status: STABLE
- Validated: Star Wars examples, Weather Factory, game analyses
- Confidence: High - distinction clarifies design decisions
- May need: Refinement for edge cases (when dressing affects mechanics)

**Build/Suggest/Omit Framework:**
- Status: STABLE
- Validated: Outer Wilds, Obra Dinn, Weather Factory, Disco Elysium
- Confidence: High - maps to observable design patterns
- May need: LLM-specific guidance (future chapter)

**Perspective Maintenance:**
- Status: STABLE
- Validated: Horror (Alien), Mystery (Obra Dinn), Cozy (Book of Hours)
- Confidence: High - explains success and failure patterns
- May need: More genre-specific guidance

**Context-Dynamics Relationship:**
- Status: STABLE
- Validated: Weather Factory proof, Star Wars analysis
- Confidence: High - explains behavioral emergence
- May need: More explicit integration with other dynamics sources
