# Session Summary: Resource Management - Brainstorming to Formalization

## 1. What We Did

**Project Phase:** Phase 1 - Foundational Concepts (Resource Management)

**Approach Used:**

1. **Brainstorm** - Discussion, questions, ideas, critique
2. **Formalize** - Structure analysis into game analyses
3. **Extract Principles** - Create Parts 7-10 of comprehensive chapter
4. (Test via scenarios - deferred to later when more Phase 1 topics complete)

**Session Goal:** Complete resource management as foundational topic through brainstorming and formalization, ready for eventual synthesis with other Phase 1 topics.

***

## 2. Starting Point

### What We Had

* Session summary from previous work (Scenario 3: Mystery Investigation analysis)
* Framework document v6 (\~35,000 words) with validated patterns
* Research plan outlining Phase 1 topics (Resource Management next)
* Core concept documents (experiential scaffolds, MDA, system evolution lessons)

### Initial Questions

User asked: "What questions do you have before we start brainstorming the next topic in research plan?"

Response clarified:

1. Resource management seemed important enough for separate substep
2. Separate document approach (eventual synthesis later)
3. Procedure: Brainstorm → Formalize → Test via scenarios
4. Use aesthetic/experiential scaffolding lens throughout

***

## 3. The Brainstorming Phase

### Core Reframing

**Initial approach (rejected):** "What can be a resource?"
**Correct approach (adopted):** "When and why should designers turn something into a tracked resource?"

**Key insight:** Resources are a **design tool** for creating specific experiences, not things that exist for their own sake.

### Starting From Aesthetics

Reframed all resource questions through MDA aesthetics:

* Challenge → Resources create strategic depth through scarcity
* Fellowship → Resources enable social bonding/coordination
* Discovery → Resources can enable or punish exploration
* Narrative → Resources create story through consequences
* Expression → Resources enable self-discovery and builds

**Critical realization:** Same resource design serves different aesthetics differently. Must start with "what experience?" not "what resources?"

### Major Conceptual Breakthroughs

#### 3.1: Resources vs. Constraints Distinction

**Resources (in-game):**

* HP, gold, spell slots, stress, armies
* Tracked by system
* Can be spent, recovered, traded
* Part of game state

**Constraints (on system):**

* Player attention/cognitive load
* Session length
* Real-world time
* Emotional safety

**Why this matters:**

* Different design tools for each
* "Brainspace" is NOT a resource (it's a constraint)
* Applying resource tools (scarcity, recovery) to constraints is wrong
* This will be separate document (Cognitive Load)

**Decision:** Keep resource management focused on in-game resources only. Mention constraints but don't conflate.

#### 3.2: Recovery Patterns as Fundamental

**Discovery:** Recovery speed shapes everything

* Fast recovery → aggressive play, high tempo, forgiving (Catan, modern WoW)
* Slow recovery → conservative play, strategic planning (HoMM3, old D\&D)
* No recovery → maximum stakes, permanent consequences (HoMM3 armies, roguelikes)
* Mixed recovery → multiple strategic layers (Blades: stress fast, harm slow)

**This affects:**

* Risk tolerance
* Decision-making timeframe
* Emotional experience
* Play rhythm

**Conclusion:** Recovery patterns need major section, not just subsection.

#### 3.3: Possession, Greed, and FOMO as Design Effects

**Possession:** What does "having" create experientially?

* Security/safety (buffer against mistakes)
* Identity/expression (this is who I am)
* Potential/options (can handle situations)
* Status/achievement (earned this)
* Power fantasy (I'm unstoppable)

**Greed:** Why accumulate beyond need?

* Loss aversion (might need it later)
* Sunk cost fallacy (already committed)
* Optimization mindset (finding "best")
* Collection as goal (accumulation is the point)

**FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** When anxiety emerges

* Formula: Irreversible scarcity + uncertainty = FOMO
* Productive FOMO: Meaningful choices, bounded consequences (Slay the Spire)
* Unproductive FOMO: Time-gating, obligation, manipulation (WoW dailies)

**Key insight:** These aren't bugs to fix universally - they're tools that serve different aesthetics differently.

**Decision:** Major section needed on psychological effects (Part 7).

#### 3.4: Cognitive Load as Separate Topic

**The realization:** Player attention/brainspace is fundamental but NOT a resource.

**Examples discussed:**

* **StarCraft:** More actions possible than executable (APM limit) - skill through impossibility
* **Warhammer 40K:** More rules than rememberable - complexity creates "skill"
* **They Are Billions (competitive):** No pause = must prioritize - "good enough now" beats "perfect later"
* **Chess/Go/Checkers:** Pure brainspace-only games (no other resources)

**Cognitive load profiles create different aesthetics:**

* Flow state (optimal load)
* Mastery fantasy (learnable complexity)
* Overwhelm (excessive load)
* Ease/accessibility (minimal load)
* Tension (time pressure + complexity)
* Zen/intuition (too complex to calculate)

**Decision:** Cognitive Load deserves separate foundational document (Phase 1 topic), not part of resources. But acknowledge connection (complex resources increase load).

***

## 4. Game Analysis Phase

### Games Selected for Deep Analysis

**Selection criteria:** Each reveals different resource patterns and aesthetic alignments.

#### Game 1: Blades in the Dark (2017)

**Why analyzed:** Innovative stress/harm separation, multiple resource types serving different purposes

**Key resources:**

* **Stress (0-9):** Buffer resource, fast recovery (between scores)
* **Harm (conditions):** Consequence resource, slow recovery (downtime/coin)
* **Load:** Capacity resource with retroactive declaration (flashbacks)
* **Coin, Rep, Heat:** Crew-level resources with different purposes

**Major innovation: Buffer/Consequence Separation**

* Traditional HP: Both protection AND health in one
* Blades: Stress (renewable buffer) vs. Harm (persistent injury)
* Different recovery rates create different strategic layers
* Agency: Choose whether to spend stress or accept harm

**What it teaches:**

* Resources can tell character arc story (trauma accumulation)
* Different recovery rates = different timeframe decisions
* Personal vs. crew resources create interesting tension

**Aesthetic served:** Narrative (desperate criminals) + Challenge (tactical resource management)

#### Game 2: Heroes of Might and Magic III (1999)

**Why analyzed:** Permanent resource loss, weekly production rhythms, territory control

**Key resources:**

* **Army units:** THE primary resource - permanent loss if defeated
* **Building resources:** Gold, wood, ore, gems, etc. - automated production
* **Movement points:** Per-turn action resource
* **Hero levels:** Accumulation only, never lost

**Critical insight: Permanent loss creates stakes**

* Unlike most games where resources regenerate
* Every battle has lasting consequences
* "Did I win efficiently?" is the question
* Everything else (gold, buildings) supports the army

**What it teaches:**

* No recovery = maximum tension (but only works if losses recoverable indirectly)
* Weekly rhythms create campaign structure
* Permanent vs. temporary resources create different strategic layers

**Aesthetic served:** Challenge (strategic resource management) + Tension (high stakes)

#### Game 3: Settlers of Catan (1995)

**Why analyzed:** Trading as core mechanic, forced spending, rubber-band mechanics

**Key resources:**

* **5 basic resources:** Brick, lumber, wool, grain, ore
* **Probabilistic production:** Dice rolls determine output
* **Hand limit + robber:** Forces spending, prevents hoarding

**Why hand limit is genius:**

* Without it: Runaway leader problem (rich get richer, compound advantage)
* With it: Must spend or lose on 7-roll (use-it-or-lose-it pressure)
* Creates: Flow of resources, social interaction, comeback mechanics

**What it teaches:**

* Forced spending prevents hoarding and runaway leaders
* Simple resources (only 5 types) enable social interaction
* Probabilistic production balances luck and strategy
* Visible board state enables negotiation

**Aesthetic served:** Fellowship (social negotiation) + Challenge (economic optimization)

#### Game 4: World of Warcraft (2004-present)

**Why analyzed:** Time-gated resources, social dependencies, evolution toward accessibility

**Key resources:**

* **HP:** Fast regeneration (out of combat) - minimal downtime
* **Class resources:** Mana/Energy/Rage - different rhythms per class
* **Cooldowns:** Time-gated abilities (not spendable, just available)
* **Currencies:** Multiple parallel progression systems (badges, tokens, etc.)
* **Time-gates:** Daily quests, weekly lockouts, seasonal events

**Evolution observed:**

* Classic WoW: High friction, slow, demanding
* Modern WoW: Streamlined, accessible, respects player time
* Trend: Reducing barriers while maintaining optional challenge

**What it teaches:**

* Fast recovery enables continuous play (no downtime waiting)
* Time-gating controls progression but creates FOMO/obligation
* Multiple currencies create parallel goals (but can overwhelm)
* Social dependencies create engagement AND friction

**Aesthetic served:** Progression (character growth) + Fellowship (social coordination) + optional Challenge (high-end content)

#### Game 5: Slay the Spire (2017)

**Why analyzed:** Composition as resource, no persistence between runs, scalable complexity

**Key resources:**

* **Deck composition:** Quality > quantity, curation is skill
* **HP:** No regeneration within run (permanent attrition)
* **Energy:** 3 per turn (fixed, tactical optimization)
* **Gold:** Within-run economy
* **Relics:** Accumulation with synergies
* **Potions:** Consumable with capacity limits

**Major innovation: Composition as Resource**

* Not "more cards = better"
* 20-card synergistic deck > 40-card powerful deck
* Addition AND subtraction both important
* "When to skip" as important as "what to take"

**What it teaches:**

* Composition creates different optimization challenge than accumulation
* No persistence = experimentation enabled (failure is cheap)
* Permanent HP loss = attrition pressure (risk/reward routing)
* Turn-based but cognitively demanding (scalable complexity)

**Aesthetic served:** Mastery (optimization) + Challenge (strategic decisions) + Discovery (build experimentation)

### Additional Context: Chess, Go, and Checkers

**Why discussed:** Pure brainspace-only games (no in-game resources except position)

**Checkers:** Simple → Solvable → No longer interesting (once solved)
**Chess:** Moderate complexity → Sweet spot for human competition
**Go:** Extreme complexity → Intuition over calculation, different aesthetic

**What they teach:**

* Can create deep play with ZERO tracked resources (just position)
* Complexity sweet spot matters (too little = solved, too much = incomprehensible)
* Simple rules can create unbounded complexity (Go)
* Brainspace-only design is viable aesthetic

**Connection to resources:** Shows resources aren't necessary for all games, but when present, should serve specific purposes.

***

## 5. Cross-Game Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Recovery Cycles Create Different Play Rhythms

* Fast (Catan, WoW) → aggressive, forgiving, high tempo
* Slow (HoMM3, Blades harm) → conservative, strategic, consequences
* None (HoMM3 armies, Slay the Spire HP) → maximum stakes
* Mixed (Blades) → multiple strategic layers

### Pattern 2: Buffer vs. Consequence Separation

* Traditional (D\&D HP): Combined
* Blades innovation: Separated (stress = buffer, harm = consequence)
* Creates: Different strategic choices, narrative arcs, agency in consequences

### Pattern 3: Forced Spending vs. Hoarding Enablement

* Systems that punish hoarding: Catan (hand limit), Blades (trauma), WoW (weekly resets)
* Systems that allow hoarding: Slay the Spire potions, Skyrim consumables
* Design choice determines flow vs. stagnation

### Pattern 4: Permanent vs. Temporary Loss

* Permanent (HoMM3, Slay the Spire HP) → high stakes
* Temporary (WoW death, Catan resources) → experimentation enabled
* Determines risk tolerance

### Pattern 5: Composition vs. Accumulation

* Accumulation: More = better (traditional RPG leveling)
* Composition: Quality > quantity (Slay the Spire deck building)
* Different optimization challenges

### Pattern 6: Personal vs. Shared Resources

* Personal (most games): Individual optimization
* Shared (Blades crew, Pandemic): Group coordination
* Mixed (Blades): Tension between individual and collective
* Zero-sum (Catan): Competition for scarce resources

### Pattern 7: Time-Gating as Progression Control

* Real-time gates (WoW): Creates obligation/FOMO
* Content gates (HoMM3 weekly): Natural pacing
* No gates (Slay the Spire): Progress at own pace
* Design choice with ethical implications

### Pattern 8: Multiple Resource Types Create Specialization

* Catan: 5 types → trading specializations
* HoMM3: 7 types → territory strategies
* Blades: Different types for different purposes
* Creates strategic depth and interdependence

## 7. Key Design Principles Established

### High-Level Principles

**Principle 1: Purpose Before Resources**
"Start with the experience you want, choose resources that create it, not vice versa"

* Validated across all 5 games
* Core of aesthetic-first design

**Principle 2: Resources Are Tools for Experience**
"Resources should serve aesthetic goals; if they don't, they shouldn't exist"

* Not "what resources can we have?" but "what resources create the experience?"

**Principle 3: Recovery Shapes Everything**
"Recovery speed determines risk tolerance, play rhythm, and strategic timeframe"

* Observed across all games
* Fast → aggressive, Slow → conservative, None → maximum stakes

**Principle 4: Separate Critical from Optional**
"Don't gate progress-critical elements behind depletable resources"

* D\&D investigation lesson (validated by Gumshoe success)
* Core clues automatic, optional depth costs resources

**Principle 5: Match Psychological Effects to Aesthetic**
"Greed, FOMO, and possession feelings should serve intended experience, not undermine it"

* Hoarding good for collection aesthetic, bad for strategic challenge
* FOMO good for meaningful choices, bad for obligation

**Principle 6: Complexity Must Justify Cognitive Cost**
"Each resource should create meaningful decisions worth the mental overhead"

* Catan: Simple (5 resources) enables socializing
* Slay the Spire: Complex enables mastery
* WoW overload: Too many currencies overwhelm

**Principle 7: Personal vs. Shared Affects Social Dynamics**
"In cooperative games, avoid zero-sum resource competition; in competitive games, embrace it"

* Catan: Zero-sum intended (competitive)
* Blades: Mixed personal/shared creates interesting tension
* MMO loot drama: Zero-sum in co-op (toxic)

### Mid-Level Guidelines

**On Scarcity:**

* Abundant → No decisions, but enables experimentation
* Moderate → Strategic choices (sweet spot for Challenge)
* High → Precious resources, careful use
* Critical → Survival horror, desperation

**On Recovery:**

* No recovery → Permanent stakes (roguelikes, HoMM3)
* Slow → Campaign-level strategy (old D\&D, Blades harm)
* Moderate → Episodic play (modern D\&D, Blades stress)
* Fast → Continuous action (WoW, Catan)

**On Spending:**

* Active → Player chooses when (agency)
* Passive → Automatic depletion (pressure)
* Reactive → Triggered by events (defensive choice)
* Investment → Long-term commitment (build decisions)

**On Types:**

* Consumable → Depletes with use (HP, ammo)
* Buffer → Protects from consequences (stress)
* Accumulation → Collects over time (XP)
* Composition → Quality > quantity (deck building)
* Capacity → Limits possibilities (inventory slots)

### Validated Anti-Patterns

**From game analysis:**

* ✅ Critical path gating (D\&D investigation) → Proven failure
* ✅ Runaway leader without rubber-band (Catan needs hand limit) → Proven fix
* ✅ Consumables never optimal to use (Skyrim potions) → Common problem
* ✅ Time-gating for metrics (WoW dailies) → Creates obligation
* ✅ Wrong system for aesthetic (D\&D for mystery) → Fundamental mismatch

***

## 8. Aesthetic Framework Refinement

### MDA + Extensions

**MDA's 8 Aesthetics (base framework):**

1. Sensation (sensory pleasure)
2. Fantasy (make-believe)
3. Narrative (drama/story)
4. Challenge (obstacle course)
5. Fellowship (social framework)
6. Discovery (exploration)
7. Expression (self-discovery)
8. Submission (pastime)

**Additional Aesthetic Goals Identified:**

* **Mastery:** System understanding, optimization (distinct from Challenge)
* **Tension:** Time pressure, stakes, adrenaline (distinct from Sensation)
* **Progression:** Growth, becoming stronger (distinct from Expression)

**Acknowledged MDA limitations:**

* Incomplete framework
* Doesn't capture all aesthetic experiences
* Use as foundation but recognize gaps

**Decision:** Use MDA + extensions throughout, note limitations explicitly.

### Aesthetic-to-Resource Mapping Created

For each aesthetic, identified:

* Which resource patterns serve it
* Which patterns conflict with it
* Examples from analyzed games
* Design guidelines

**Example: Challenge Aesthetic**

* ✓ Moderate scarcity (creates choices)
* ✓ Active spending (player agency)
* ✓ Multiple resource types (optimization)
* ✗ Too abundant (no decisions)
* ✗ Too scarce (frustration)

**This mapping became core of Part 9 (Decision Framework).**

***

## 9. Connections to Previous Work

### Validated System Evolution Lessons

**Our findings confirmed and extended previous lessons:**

**L1: Complexity is a budget** → Extended to cognitive load as constraint
**L4: Spatial > numerical complexity** → Confirmed (brainspace analysis)
**L12: Resources create meaningful choices through scarcity** → Core principle
**L13: Track what matters for experience** → Aesthetic-first design
**L14: Different resources for different purposes** → Blades example
**L15: Recovery cycles create pacing** → Major section in our work
**L16: In-game resources ≠ scenario constraints** → Critical distinction established

**New insights added:**

* Brainspace as fundamental constraint (not resource)
* Skill through impossibility (StarCraft, Warhammer pattern)
* Buffer/consequence separation (Blades innovation)
* Psychological effects as design tools (possession, greed, FOMO)

### Connection to Scenario 3 Analysis

**Mystery investigation validated:**

* Information Management is critical System Function
* Core clues should be automatic (not gated)
* Investigation points for optional depth (Gumshoe model)
* Character creation as aesthetic filter

**Pattern generalized:**

* Critical path resources → Progress blockers (Anti-Pattern 1.1)
* Applies beyond mysteries to any progress-critical element
* Solution: Separate core (automatic) from optional (costs resources)

### Framework v6 Enhancement Areas

**What we added to framework understanding:**

* Resources as tool for aesthetics (expanded Function 7)
* Recovery patterns create pacing (expanded Function 4)
* Psychological effects must be designed intentionally
* Cognitive load as constraint on feasible designs
* Social dynamics shaped by ownership models

**This feeds into eventual Phase 1 synthesis.**

***

## 10. Methodological Insights

### What Worked

**Starting from aesthetics:**

* Reframing "what resources?" to "what experience?" was crucial
* Prevented "space coffee" (slapping resources on without purpose)
* Grounded all decisions in player experience

**Multiple game analysis:**

* 5 games revealed patterns single game wouldn't
* Validated patterns across different genres/years
* Showed both successes and failures (D\&D investigation)

**Brainstorm → Formalize separation:**

* Exploration phase generated insights
* Formalization phase organized into actionable framework
* Clear progression from ideas to principles

**Tiered principle approach:**

* High-level (broad patterns)
* Mid-level (specific applications)
* Low-level (concrete examples)
* Made principles both general and actionable

### What Was Challenging

**MDA limitations:**

* Framework doesn't capture everything (Mastery, Tension, Progression)
* Had to extend it while acknowledging it's incomplete
* Solution: Transparent about additions and limitations

**Resources vs. Constraints distinction:**

* Easy to slip into calling everything a "resource"
* Cognitive load kept being confused with in-game resources
* Solution: Explicit distinction in appendix, separate future doc

**Scope creep:**

* Could analyze infinite games
* Could discuss every edge case
* Solution: Focus on validated patterns, note confidence levels

**Cognitive load tangent:**

* Discovered it's fundamental but separate topic
* Risk of derailing resource management discussion
* Solution: Brief coverage, defer to future document

### Quality Indicators

**Confidence markers used:**

* ✅ Validated (across multiple games)
* ⚠️ Hypothesis (logical but limited evidence)
* ❓ Speculative (needs testing)

**This maintains scientific rigor while building practical framework.**

### Document Structure Decisions

**Why 10 parts:**

* Too large for single document (\~200KB total)
* Each part could be read independently
* Natural conceptual divisions
* Easier to reference specific topics

**Format choices:**

* Quote blocks for notes/counter-examples (markdown)
* Special formatting for anti-patterns (> **Anti-Pattern: Name**)
* Aesthetic alignment tags (✓ Serves, ✗ Conflicts, \~ Neutral)
* Practical "book chapter" style (not academic paper)

***

## 11. What We Learned About Resource Design

### Core Insights

**1. Resources are aesthetic tools, not default features**

* Don't include resources because "games have HP/XP/gold"
* Include because they create intended experience
* Every resource should justify its existence

**2. Recovery patterns are fundamental, not afterthought**

* Speed of recovery shapes risk tolerance
* Creates play rhythm (attrition, episodic, continuous)
* One of most important design decisions

**3. Psychological effects are designable**

* Possession feelings can be shaped
* Greed can be encouraged or prevented
* FOMO can be productive or manipulative
* Not accidents, but design choices

**4. Same resource serves different aesthetics differently**

* Accumulation good for Progression, bad for Challenge
* Scarcity good for Tension, bad for Fellowship
* Must match resource to aesthetic goal

**5. Critical path resources are special case**

* If necessary for progress, don't gate behind depletion
* D\&D investigation lesson generalizes broadly
* Separate core (automatic) from optional (costs resources)

### Practical Takeaways

**For designers:**

1. Start with aesthetic goal ("what experience?")
2. Choose resources that create that experience
3. Design properties to serve it (scarcity, recovery, spending, ownership)
4. Validate against psychology (possession, greed, FOMO)
5. Check anti-patterns (avoid known pitfalls)
6. Playtest and iterate

**Red flags:**

* Resource exists "because games have it"
* Tracking is tedious (not interesting decisions)
* Critical progress gated behind depletion
* Creates unintended psychological effects
* Social toxicity in multiplayer
* Complexity without benefit

**Green flags:**

* Resource creates meaningful decisions
* Serves aesthetic goal clearly
* Psychological effects intentional
* Social dynamics appropriate
* Tracking cost justified by decisions

***

## 12. Status and Next Steps

### Resource Management Status

**Completion:** Phase 1 foundational topic complete through formalization

* ✅ Brainstorming phase complete (extensive)
* ✅ Game analysis complete (5 games)
* ✅ Formalization complete (Parts 7-10)
* ❌ Scenario testing (deferred until Phase 1 complete)

**Documents created:**

* Game Analyses (43KB)
* Part 7: Psychological Effects (28KB)
* Part 8: Common Pitfalls (27KB)
* Part 9: Decision Framework (42KB)
* Part 10: Appendices (18KB)
* **Total new content: \~158KB (plus earlier parts 1-6)**

**Confidence level:**

* High confidence on core principles (validated across games)
* Medium confidence on some applications (need more testing)
* Open questions documented (transparent about limits)

### What's Next in Phase 1

**Remaining foundational topics:**

1. **Cognitive Load and System Complexity** (identified as critical during this session)
2. **Worldbuilding** (setting and context)
3. **Balance and Parameter Optimization** (tuning after structure)
4. **Emergence and Adaptation** (how systems create unexpected gameplay)

**Then:**

* **Phase 1 Synthesis:** Integrate all foundational concepts into unified framework
* **Phase 2:** Scenario deep dives using complete framework
* **Phase 3:** Pattern extraction across scenarios
* **Phase 4:** Final framework development and implementation

### Cognitive Load as Next Topic?

**Strong case for doing Cognitive Load next:**

* Emerged as fundamental during resource management discussion
* Affects all other design decisions (balance, worldbuilding, etc.)
* Clearly distinct from resources (constraint vs. mechanic)
* Real-time vs. turn-based as aesthetic choice
* Already have substantial analysis from brainstorming phase

**Content ready:**

* StarCraft/Warhammer "skill through impossibility"
* They Are Billions competitive mode
* Chess/Go/Checkers analysis
* Aesthetic profiles (flow, mastery, overwhelm, tension, zen)
* Connection to MDA aesthetics

**Decision point:** Continue with Cognitive Load, or do Worldbuilding/Balance first?

### Integration Points

**When Phase 1 complete, need to synthesize:**

* How resources, cognitive load, worldbuilding, balance, emergence interact
* Unified decision framework across all topics
* Master checklist for system design
* Case studies applying complete framework

**This session provides strong foundation for synthesis.**

***

## 13. Meta-Observations

### On the Process

**Brainstorming effectiveness:**

* Starting with "wrong" question led to reframing
* Multiple game examples revealed patterns
* Cognitive load tangent was productive (identified new topic)
* User corrections kept us on track (resources ≠ constraints)

**Format decisions:**

* 10-part structure worked well (manageable, modular)
* Tiered principles provide flexibility
* Confidence markers maintain rigor
* Practical style over academic serves audience

**User guidance critical:**

* "Start from aesthetic/experience" reframing
* "Not a resource, prove it or use different term" clarity
* "Separate document for cognitive load" scope management
* Questions and corrections kept quality high

### On Framework Development

**Pattern emerging:**

1. Identify topic from research plan
2. Brainstorm broadly (explore, question, critique)
3. Analyze concrete examples (games, scenarios)
4. Extract patterns and principles
5. Formalize into structured documents
6. Test against additional scenarios (future)
7. Iterate and refine

**This mirrors scientific method:**

* Observation (game analysis)
* Hypothesis (patterns)
* Theory (principles)
* Validation (scenario testing)
* Refinement (iteration)

**"Practice → Pattern → Principle" approach working well.**

### On Quality and Rigor

**Maintaining quality:**

* Confidence markers (validated/hypothesis/speculative)
* Multiple examples per principle
* Counter-examples where relevant
* Explicit limitations (MDA incomplete, etc.)
* Connection to previous work (System Evolution Lessons)

**Avoiding pitfalls:**

* Not calling everything a resource (precision in terminology)
* Not assuming LLMs solve everything ("space coffee" avoidance)
* Not overgeneralizing from single example (require multiple games)
* Not hiding uncertainty (transparent about confidence)

**Academic rigor + practical utility balance achieved.**

* Phase 1: \~30% complete (resource management done, 3-4 topics remain)
* Overall research plan: On track

**Quality:**

* High confidence on core principles (validated)
* Clear about limitations (MDA incomplete, some hypotheses)
* Practical and actionable (decision framework)
* Rigorous and scientific (confidence markers, multiple examples)

**The approach is working:** Concrete scenarios → Analysis → Patterns → Principles → Framework
