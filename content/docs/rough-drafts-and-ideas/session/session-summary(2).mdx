# Session Summary: Framework Development and Scenario Testing

## 1. What We Are Doing

**Project Goal:** Developing a comprehensive framework for designing purpose-driven game systems, with focus on LLM-enabled experiences that preserve experiential goals while enabling adaptive gameplay.

**Approach:**

* Use concrete scenarios as design drivers (not abstract theory)
* Analyze what makes each scenario work (system design principles)
* Extract generalizable patterns (the framework)
* Validate through scenario testing and iteration

**Core Philosophy:** Purpose before mechanics. Systems should start with intended experience (aesthetic) and design mechanics to serve it, not the reverse.

**Current Phase:** Testing framework against real scenarios to identify gaps, validate principles, and extract design patterns.

## 3. Where We Are in the Research Plan

### Original Research Plan Structure

**Phase 1: Foundational Concepts (Bootstrapping)** ⏳ IN PROGRESS

* Deep dive: What is a game system? → Foundation document created, pre-validated
* Deep dive: Resource management → NEXT (general, not mystery-specific)
* Deep dive: Worldbuilding → UPCOMING (general, not mystery-specific)
* Deep dive: Balance → UPCOMING
* Deep dive: Emergence and adaptation → UPCOMING

**Phase 2: Scenario Deep Dives** 📋 FUTURE

* After Phase 1 complete, synthesize into framework
* Then do actual deep dives on 2-3 scenarios
* Extract patterns from each
* Build pattern library

**Phase 3: Pattern Extraction** 📋 FUTURE

* Synthesize across scenarios
* Identify what's universal vs. scenario-specific
* Build general framework

**Phase 4: Framework Development** 📋 FUTURE

* Design frameworks (decision trees, pattern catalogs)
* Implementation architectures
* Evaluation methodologies
* Case studies

### What We Actually Did

**Phase 1.1: Created Foundation Document** ✅

* Created "What is a Game System?" (v1-v6)
* Covered:
  * Five Components (Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing, Configuration)
  * Academic frameworks (MDA, Ludology, Player Types)
  * Core Loops and Engagement Curves
  * Flow State and Investment/Payoff
  * Seven System Functions
  * Designer Responsibility and Ethics
  * Market Strategy (Megabonk)
* Document is \~35,000 words
* Status: **Foundation document complete, but not yet "deep dive"**

**Phase 1.2: Pre-Validated Foundation** ✅

* Used Scenario 3 (Mystery Investigation) as test case
* Purpose: Check if framework provides useful vocabulary and analysis tools
* Result: Framework works, identified strengths and gaps
* Enhanced framework with findings (Part 12: Research Notes)
* Status: **Pre-validation complete**

**Important distinction:** We created foundational document and tested it works. We did NOT do full "deep dive" yet. Deep dives happen after Phase 1 is complete and we have full framework to apply.

### Where We Actually Are

**Completed:**

* ✅ Foundation document: "What is a Game System?" created
* ✅ Pre-validation: Tested framework against Scenario 3 (mystery)
* ✅ Framework enhancements: Integrated findings, documented hypotheses

**Current Status:** Phase 1 still in progress. Have foundation document but need to complete other foundational concepts.

**Still Need for Phase 1:**

* ❌ Deep dive: Resource Management (general principles, not mystery-specific)
* ❌ Deep dive: Worldbuilding (general principles, not mystery-specific)
* ❌ Deep dive: Balance
* ❌ Deep dive: Emergence and Adaptation

**Key insight:** We can't do true "deep dives" on scenarios until we have the complete framework from Phase 1. Right now we're building the framework itself.

### What Scenario 3 Actually Was

**Not:** A deep dive on mystery investigation systems
**Actually:** A pre-validation test of the foundation document

**What we did:**

1. Applied framework to real scenario (mystery investigation)
2. Checked if framework provides useful analysis
3. Identified what framework does well (Five Components, MDA, Functions)
4. Identified what's missing (Information Management details, Character Creation filtering)
5. Enhanced framework with findings
6. Documented hypotheses for future testing

**What we learned:**

* Framework structure is sound (provides useful vocabulary)
* Framework has gaps (needed Information Management enhancement)
* Some principles validated (Configuration Coherence, Aesthetic-First)
* Some hypotheses need testing (Agency Priority, Pacing Automation)

**Result:** Better foundation document, not complete scenario analysis.

### Next Steps (From Research Plan)

**Phase 1 continuation:**

**Next session: Resource Management (General)** 📋 NEXT

* What can be a resource? (tangible, abstract, meta)
* Resource scarcity as design tool
* Recovery cycles and pacing
* LLM opportunities: What becomes trackable that wasn't before?
* **Critical:** In-game resources vs scenario constraints (player time, attention)
* This is GENERAL resource management, not mystery-specific

**Possible same session: Worldbuilding (General)** 📋 POSSIBLE

* Setting vs world (static description vs dynamic space)
* Worldbuilding for different purposes (exploration vs backdrop)
* Consistency vs flexibility
* How LLMs change worldbuilding constraints
* This is GENERAL worldbuilding, not mystery-specific

**After completing foundational concepts:**

* Synthesize Phase 1 into complete framework
* THEN do actual deep dives on scenarios (Phase 2)
* Deep dives will be much richer with complete framework

### Why This Order Matters

**Current approach (correct):**

1. Build foundation document ("What is a Game System?")
2. Pre-validate it works (Scenario 3 test)
3. Complete other foundational concepts (Resource Management, Worldbuilding, Balance, Emergence)
4. Synthesize into complete framework
5. THEN do deep dives on scenarios with full framework available

**What we're NOT doing:**

* Deep diving on scenarios before framework is complete
* Making mystery-specific analysis
* Treating Scenario 3 as definitive pattern

**What we ARE doing:**

* Building foundational understanding piece by piece
* Testing framework as we build it
* Preparing for true deep dives once framework is complete

### Research Plan Quote (Context)

Original plan said for first session:

> "Deep enough to extract patterns, then apply to another scenario"

**What this meant:**

* Get foundation document deep enough to be useful
* Test it on one scenario to validate it works
* This gives us patterns to refine

**We did exactly this:**

* Foundation document created (deep enough)
* Tested on Scenario 3 (validated it works)
* Extracted some patterns (documented in Part 12)

**Now continuing Phase 1 with other foundational concepts before doing actual deep dives.**

## 4. Results of "What is a Game System" Session

### Major Accomplishments

**1. Validated Framework Through Real Scenario**

* Tested framework against Scenario 3 (Mystery Investigation)
* Framework provided useful vocabulary and analysis tools
* Identified both strengths and gaps

**2. Discovered Critical Insights**

**Information Management is Critical Function:**

* Mystery games prove not all functions are equal
* Some aesthetics depend on specific functions working well
* D\&D fails at mystery because information management is broken
* Enhanced framework with detailed Information Management section

**Character Creation as Aesthetic Filter:**

* Generic character creation allows incompatible characters
* "Cowardly warrior" in mystery game breaks aesthetic
* Systems can't force player investment, but can filter for compatible players
* Added new framework principle to Part 11

**System Selection Matters:**

* Using wrong system for aesthetic causes predictable failures
* D\&D-for-mystery demonstrates configuration incoherence
* Added System Selection Error as Common Mistake #11
* Created 4-step detection process

**3. Identified Patterns for Testing**

**Four hypotheses need validation:**

1. Agency Priority by Aesthetic (interpretation first for mystery—does this generalize?)
2. Pacing Automation Spectrum (high/medium/low automation for different aesthetics)
3. The 20/80 Preparation Problem (GM preps everything, players see 20%)
4. Red Herring Design Pattern (missing element makes false info distinguishable)

**Three open research questions:**

1. Guaranteed Progress vs. Stakes (where should tension live?)
2. Character Investment Limits (what can systems force vs. can't?)
3. LLM Content Quality (how to avoid "AI slop"?)

**4. Validated Existing Framework Principles**

**Five findings confirm framework is correct:**

1. Configuration Coherence is measurable (D\&D mechanics vs. mystery context)
2. Aesthetic-First Design predicts success (Gumshoe vs. D\&D comparison)
3. Investment/Payoff must match player energy (monthly sessions problem)
4. System Functions are not equal (mystery needs specific functions)
5. Character Creation can break systems (wrong character types)

**5. Enhanced Framework Document**

**Integrated immediately (Category A - high confidence):**

* Enhanced Information Management (Part 10, Function 2): \~1,200 words
  * Core vs. optional information framework
  * Traditional vs. Mystery Game models
  * Design questions and tests

* Character Creation as Aesthetic Filter (Part 11): \~800 words
  * Real example and problem explanation
  * Three implementation approaches
  * Decision tree for which to use

* System Selection Error (Part 7, Mistake #11): \~1,000 words
  * D\&D-for-mystery detailed example
  * 4-step detection process
  * Three fix options

**Added Part 12: Research Notes and Open Hypotheses:** \~6,000 words

* Documents hypotheses needing testing (Category B)
* Documents open research questions (Category C)
* Documents validated findings from Scenario 3
* Transparent about confidence levels
* Scientific approach to framework development

**Total additions:** \~9,000 words, bringing framework to \~35,000 words

### Key Takeaways for Next Session

**What works in framework:**

* Five Components provide clear analytical structure
* System Functions correctly identify critical capabilities
* MDA aesthetic-first approach is validated
* Investment/Payoff spectrum explains real problems

**What needs more testing:**

* Agency priority patterns (test against Scenario 1)
* Pacing automation spectrum (test against different aesthetics)
* 20/80 problem generalization (test in non-mystery contexts)
* Red herring principle (test beyond mystery)

**What framework now provides:**

* Clear diagnostic for system selection (check functions, check coherence)
* Character creation guidance (filter for aesthetic fit)
* Information management principles (core vs. optional)
* Explicit confidence levels (validated vs. hypothetical)

### Specific Learnings from Scenario 3

**D\&D for Mystery - Why it fails:**

* Information Management: ❌ Broken (roll to find, can miss clues)
* Configuration: ❌ Incoherent (combat mechanics in investigation context)
* Character Creation: ❌ Too broad (allows non-investigators)
* Core Loop: ❌ Breaks on failure (investigation stalls)
* Result: Players solve mysteries through violence ("if it has stats, kill it")

**Gumshoe for Mystery - Why it succeeds:**

* Information Management: ✅ Core clues automatic, optional clues cost points
* Configuration: ✅ Coherent (investigation mechanics in investigation context)
* Character Creation: ✅ Filtered (mandatory Drives ensure investment)
* Core Loop: ✅ Always completes (find clue → interpret → choose next scene)
* Result: Progress guaranteed, challenge shifts to interpretation

**LLM Opportunities Identified:**

1. Dynamic content generation (solves 20/80 problem)
2. Natural language investigation (no skill translation)
3. Perfect state tracking (solves monthly session continuity)
4. NPC consistency (remembers lies and statements)
5. Factual verification (prevents plot holes)
6. Fair-play mystery generation (ensures solvability)
7. Adaptive difficulty (matches player pace)
8. Solo play support (GM-less mysteries)

**Design Patterns Extracted:**

1. Core Clue Doctrine (automatic core clues)
2. Investigation Point Economy (depth vs. breadth choices)
3. Character Drives (mandatory investment)
4. Progressive Revelation Pacing (act-based structure)
5. Adversary Reaction System (villain escalates)
6. Red Herring Design (distinguishable false leads)

### Framework Structure Now

**Part 1-9:** Historical analysis, components, functions (largely unchanged)
**Part 10:** System Functions - enhanced Information Management
**Part 11:** Designer Responsibility - added Character Creation as Filter
**Part 12:** Research Notes (NEW) - hypotheses, research questions, validated findings
**Conclusion:** Updated with new lessons

### Confidence Assessment

**High Confidence (Ready to Use):**

* Information Management framework (validated by Scenario 3)
* Character Creation filtering (validated by real example)
* System Selection diagnostic (validated by D\&D/Gumshoe comparison)
* Configuration coherence principle (validated by player behavior)

**Medium Confidence (Needs Testing):**

* Agency priority patterns (one scenario isn't enough)
* Pacing automation spectrum (logical but untested)
* 20/80 preparation problem (mystery-specific or general?)
* Red herring design (mystery-specific or generalizable?)

**Low Confidence (Needs Research):**

* Guaranteed progress vs. stakes (psychological question)
* Investment forcing limits (design boundaries unclear)
* LLM content quality (implementation-dependent)

***

## Next Session Plan (Continuing Phase 1)

**Goal:** Continue building foundational concepts before doing actual deep dives

**Primary Topic: Resource Management (General)**

**Questions to explore:**

1. What can be a resource? (tangible, abstract, meta)
2. Resource scarcity as design tool
3. Recovery cycles and pacing
4. **Critical distinction:** In-game resources vs scenario constraints
   * In-game: HP, ammo, spell slots, investigation points, stress (managed BY system)
   * Scenario: Player time, attention, session length (external constraints ON play)
5. LLM opportunities: What becomes trackable that wasn't before?

**This is GENERAL resource management, not mystery-specific. Builds foundation for all scenarios.**

**Secondary Topic (if time): Worldbuilding (General)**

**Questions to explore:**

1. Setting vs world (static description vs dynamic space)
2. Worldbuilding for different purposes (exploration vs backdrop)
3. Consistency vs flexibility
4. How LLMs change worldbuilding constraints

**This is GENERAL worldbuilding, not mystery-specific. Builds foundation for all scenarios.**

**Approach:**

* Discuss general principles
* Use examples from multiple genres (not just mystery)
* Build foundational understanding
* Create document similar to "What is a Game System?"

**Deliverable:**

* "Resource Management" foundational document (similar structure to game systems doc)
* Possibly "Worldbuilding" foundational document if we cover both

**Why this order:**

* Complete Phase 1 foundational concepts
* Build complete framework before deep dives
* Resource management and worldbuilding are fundamental (like game systems)
* Once all Phase 1 topics complete, can synthesize and do true deep dives

**After Phase 1 Complete:**

* Synthesize all foundational concepts into unified framework
* THEN do actual deep dives on scenarios (Phase 2)
* Deep dives will be much richer with complete framework

**Remaining Phase 1 after next session:**

* Balance (general principles)
* Emergence and Adaptation (general principles)
* Synthesis of Phase 1 into complete framework

***

## Summary

**What we did:** Analyzed mystery investigation systems, validated framework through real scenario, identified gaps, enhanced framework, documented hypotheses.

**What we have:** Comprehensive framework (v6, \~35,000 words) with validated principles, working hypotheses, and transparent confidence levels. Complete Scenario 3 analysis. Clear next steps.

**Where we are:** Phase 2 of research plan - scenario deep dives. Scenario 3 complete, Scenario 1 next.

**What we learned:** Information management is critical function, character creation filters aesthetic fit, system selection matters, framework works for diagnosis, several patterns identified and need broader testing.

**Status:** Framework is practical and usable now (high-confidence parts), scientific and transparent about what needs more testing (hypotheses), ready to proceed with Scenario 1 analysis to validate and extract more patterns.
