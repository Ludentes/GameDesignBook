## **The Same Instrument, Different Music**

Imagine three musicians seated at three identical pianos.

The first launches into a bright, improvisational jazz riff—unpredictable, playful, alive.\
The second performs a rigid étude—precise, disciplined, demanding exacting control.\
The third creates an ambient soundscape—long, dissolving chords meant to soothe rather than excite.

Three musicians.\
Three performances.\
One instrument.

Nothing about the piano changed. What changed was the *intent*, the *emphasis*, and the *configuration* of the same underlying toolset.\
The piano is just an instrument.\
The music is what emerges from how the instrument is played.

Game design works the same way.

Mechanics—dice, cards, action points, cooldowns, physics interactions—are instruments. Designers decide how to “play” them: which notes to strike, which to avoid, which to hold, and which to let decay. The mechanics don’t determine the experience any more than piano keys determine whether you’re hearing jazz or a funeral dirge.

Two games can share the same mechanics and produce entirely different emotional and experiential outcomes. Designers know this intuitively, yet conversations often fixate on the mechanics themselves, as if mechanics automatically guarantee a particular experience.

They don’t.\
**The system—the way mechanics are arranged, framed, paced, and contextualized—is what creates experience.**

Before we talk about how to build systems, we need to emphasize how profoundly this principle shapes game design—because it’s visible everywhere across the medium.

## **Same Systems, Different Worlds**

Take two games released in the same year: *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy*.

Both rely heavily on physics-driven interactions—momentum, friction, timing, player-applied force. Their core mechanical substrate is surprisingly similar: predictable physical systems that the player must learn to manipulate.

And yet:

* Breath of the Wild uses physics to create delight, creativity, and playful experimentation.

* Getting Over It uses physics to generate frustration, tension, and a kind of masochistic humor.

Same instrument.\
Two wildly different compositions.

This is the heart of system design: **mechanics are ingredients; the system is the recipe.**\
It’s not the presence of physics, cards, dice, timers, or resource tracks that defines experience—but how these elements interact, constrain, and reinforce one another across time.

We can see this principle even more clearly when a single developer intentionally builds two games using the *same mechanical foundation*.

## The Same Mechanics, Different Games

In 2019, Weather Factory released *Cultist Simulator*, a frantic, opaque occult management game built around cards, verbs, and timers. Every action costs time. Every decision could lead to starvation, madness, or unwanted attention. The core experience is *pressure, risk, and momentum*.

Four years later, they released *Book of Hours*.

It uses the same building blocks: cards, verbs, timers.\
It looks and behaves almost like a sibling.\
The instrument is the same.

Yet the experience could not be more different.

Book of Hours is meditative, deliberate, cozy. There is no death, no spiraling failure. Instead of pressure, the game cultivates *gentle rhythm, curiosity, and quiet accomplishment*. The same mechanics have been repurposed through different pacing, stakes, constraints, and aesthetic framing to produce a completely different emotional landscape.

If mechanics were systems, these two games would feel identical.\
They don’t.\
Because mechanics are not systems.

Weatherfactory didn’t “reskin” a game.\
They built two different *experiential scaffolds* using the same mechanical instrument—just as three pianists can produce three genres of music using the same keys.

This book is about learning how to design that scaffold:\
how to arrange mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing so that they produce the experience you intend, *reliably*, across players and sessions.
