# Research Plan: From Scenarios to Framework

## The Big Picture

### What We're Actually Doing

We're not just "building LLM tools for TTRPGs." We're developing a framework for designing purpose-driven game systems where LLMs enable experiences that were previously impossible or impractical.

**The research question:** How do we design game systems that preserve experiential goals while leveraging LLM capabilities for adaptation and emergence?

**Our approach:**

1. Use concrete scenarios as design drivers (not abstract theory)
2. Analyze what makes each scenario work (system design principles)
3. Extract generalizable patterns (the framework)
4. Validate through implementation and testing

### Why Scenarios Come First

**Traditional approach (abstract → concrete):**

* Define what LLMs can do
* Theorize about game design
* Try to find applications
* **Problem:** Solutions looking for problems, "space coffee"

**Our approach (concrete → abstract):**

* Start with real problems (scenarios)
* Understand what makes each work
* Extract common patterns
* Build framework from patterns
* **Advantage:** Framework grounded in real needs

**The scenarios are not just examples - they're design probes.** Each scenario tests different aspects of the design space and reveals different requirements.

## What We Have (Current State)

### Documents Created

1. **Core concept:** Games as purpose-built experiential scaffolds
2. **System analysis:** Why different mechanics create different experiences
3. **Six scenarios:** Real problems with TTRPG and cross-medium analysis
4. **Thesis framing:** How to position this research

### Student Deliverables (Coming)

* Understanding of game systems
* Analysis of 2-3 scenarios
* 1-2 original scenarios they created
* Decision on what interests them

### What We Don't Have Yet

* Formal framework for system design
* Design patterns and principles
* Implementation architecture
* Evaluation methodology
* Deep dive on foundational concepts (game systems, worldbuilding, balance)

## What We Need Next

### Phase 1: Foundational Concepts (This Document Bootstraps)

Before we can build frameworks, we need to deeply understand:

**1. What is a game system?**

* Beyond "rules" - what makes a system coherent?
* Relationship between mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics (MDA)
* **Resource management as core component** (in-game resources: HP, stress, ammo, social capital)
* System as constraint vs system as enabler
* When to have rules vs when to have principles

**2. What is resource management?** (Dedicated deep dive after initial system understanding)

* **Critical distinction:** In-game resources vs scenario constraints
  * In-game: HP, ammo, spell slots, stress, reputation (managed by game system)
  * Scenario: Player time, attention, emotional safety, session length (external constraints on play)
  * Tools for each are different - don't conflate
* What can be a resource? (tangible, abstract, meta)
* Resource scarcity as design tool
* Recovery cycles and pacing
* LLM opportunities: What becomes trackable that wasn't before?

**3. What is worldbuilding?**

* Setting vs world (static description vs dynamic space)
* Worldbuilding for different purposes (exploration vs backdrop)
* Consistency vs flexibility
* How LLMs change worldbuilding constraints

**4. What is balance?**

* Balance for what purpose? (fairness? challenge? pacing?)
* Different types of balance (symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic)
* When balance matters vs when it doesn't
* Balance in emergent vs authored systems

**5. What is emergence and adaptation?**

* Designed emergence vs accidental chaos
* Rules that create interesting possibilities
* When emergence serves purpose vs when it derails
* Reactive (respond to player) vs proactive (anticipate)
* Micro-adaptation (moment-to-moment) vs macro-adaptation (across sessions)
* Adaptation that preserves purpose vs adaptation that drifts

### Phase 2: Scenario Deep Dives

For each scenario (or subset we focus on), analyze:

**System Design Requirements:**

* What mechanics are needed?
* What needs to be explicit vs implicit?
* What needs consistency vs what benefits from variation?
* How do players interact with the system?

**Worldbuilding Requirements:**

* What aspects of world need detail?
* What can be abstracted?
* How does world respond to player actions?
* What maintains coherence?

**Balance Considerations:**

* What needs to be balanced and why?
* What type of balance serves the purpose?
* How do you detect imbalance?
* How do you correct without disrupting?

**LLM Role:**

* What does LLM handle vs what's pre-authored?
* Where does LLM add value?
* What are failure modes?
* How do you constrain appropriately?

### Phase 3: Pattern Extraction

After analyzing scenarios, identify:

**Design Patterns:**

* Recurring solutions to recurring problems
* When to use each pattern
* Trade-offs of each approach

**Anti-Patterns:**

* Common mistakes
* Why they fail
* How to avoid them

**Design Principles:**

* General guidelines that apply across scenarios
* When principles conflict (and how to resolve)

### Phase 4: Framework Development

Synthesize into:

**Decision Framework:**

* Given experiential goal, how do you choose system approach?
* Given technical constraints, what's feasible?
* How do you evaluate if design serves purpose?

**Design Process:**

* Steps from concept to implementation
* Validation at each stage
* Iteration and refinement

**Implementation Patterns:**

* Technical architectures for common needs
* How to structure LLM interactions
* State management approaches
* Evaluation methodologies

## Bootstrapping the Foundational Concepts

### Starting Point: What is a Game System?

This is where we need to begin our deep dive. A game system is more than just "the rules."

**Initial questions to explore:**

1. **What makes a system vs just a collection of rules?**

   * Is D\&D a system or a toolkit?
   * What's the difference between coherent and incoherent systems?
   * When do more rules make system better vs worse?
2. **What are the components of a game system?**

   * Resolution mechanics (how do we determine outcomes?)
   * **Resource management (in-game):** What gets tracked and why? HP, stress, ammo, reputation, favors
   * Pacing mechanisms (what controls rhythm of play?)
   * Feedback loops (how do actions create consequences?)
   * Constraint systems (what's possible/impossible?)
3. **What's the relationship between system and fiction?**

   * Do mechanics serve fiction or vice versa?
   * When should mechanics fade into background vs be prominent?
   * How does system encode theme/tone?
4. **What makes a system good for a specific purpose?**

   * System for tactical challenge (D\&D combat)
   * System for social drama (Monsterhearts)
   * System for exploration (OSR minimalism)
   * System for moral choices (Dogs in the Vineyard)
5. **How do systems scale?**

   * Simple → complex (when to add mechanics?)
   * Few players → many players
   * One-shot → campaign
   * Tight → emergent

**Approach:**

* Study existing system design (D\&D, PbtA, Blades, OSR, story games)
* For each: What is the system optimizing for? What resources are tracked and why?
* Map: Purpose → System Architecture → Specific Mechanics (including resources)
* Identify: What would be different with LLM support?

### Second Focus: Resource Management (Dedicated Deep Dive)

**After understanding game systems generally, focus specifically on resource management as a design tool.**

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

* **In-game resources:** HP, ammo, spell slots, stress, reputation, favors, time-in-fiction
  * These are managed BY the game system
  * Players make strategic decisions about them
  * They create meaningful choices and pacing
* **Scenario constraints:** Player real-time, session length, player attention, emotional safety
  * These are constraints ON the game
  * Designer must work within them
  * Different tools and approaches needed

**Don't conflate these. They require different frameworks.**

**Initial questions (in-game resources only):**

1. **What makes something a resource?**

   * Trackable (can be measured)
   * Scarce (limited in some way)
   * Meaningful (spending it matters)
   * Recoverable (or permanently lost - both valid)
2. **What can be a resource?**

   * Tangible: HP, ammo, gold, equipment
   * Abstract: Stress, sanity, corruption, heat
   * Social: Reputation, favors owed, trust, influence
   * Knowledge: Information as currency
   * Meta: Fate points, luck, narrative control
3. **Why manage resources?**

   * Create scarcity → force decisions
   * Represent fictional constraints (running out of bullets)
   * Control pacing (depletion creates pressure)
   * Encode theme (what's tracked = what matters)
   * Create feedback loops (using resources has consequences)
4. **How are resources managed?**

   * Depletion models (spend until empty, then rest)
   * Refresh models (reset each scene/session)
   * Exchange models (trade one resource for another)
   * Risk/reward models (gamble resources for outcomes)
   * Dynamic models (resources change based on fiction)
5. **What's the recovery cycle?**

   * No recovery (permanent loss, high stakes)
   * Scene/encounter refresh (tactical resource)
   * Session refresh (strategic resource)
   * Campaign milestone (rare resource)
   * Varies by fiction (heal when you rest, recover stress when you downtime)
6. **How does scarcity level affect experience?**

   * Abundant resources → exploration, creativity, low stress
   * Moderate scarcity → tactical decisions, strategy
   * Severe scarcity → survival pressure, desperation
   * No resources → pure narrative, focus on story not mechanics
7. **What LLMs enable for resource management?**

   * Track complex resource webs (NPC resources, faction economies, reputation networks)
   * Natural language resources ("cash in favor" without explicit tracking)
   * Dynamic resource adjustment (detect starvation/abundance, adjust)
   * Emergent resource systems (relationships as trackable resources)
   * Resources too complex for human tracking become feasible

**Approach:**

* Study resource management across game types
  * D\&D: HP/spell slots (depletion + rest)
  * Blades: Stress/load (multiple resources interact)
  * Fate: Fate points (player narrative control)
  * Dogs: Dice pools (escalation as resource spend)
* For each: What resources? Why those? How do they create intended experience?
* Identify: What resources would be valuable but too complex to track manually?
* Consider: How do LLMs change what's feasible?

**Initial questions:**

1. **What is worldbuilding in game context?**

   * Not "describe setting" - what does the world DO?
   * Active world vs passive backdrop
   * Player-facing vs GM-only information
   * Established canon vs emergent details
2. **How detailed should worldbuilding be?**

   * Fractal worldbuilding (detail where players look)
   * Minimal viable world (just enough to play)
   * When detail adds vs when it constrains
   * How LLMs change the detail/constraint trade-off
3. **How does world serve purpose?**

   * World for exploration (mysteries to uncover)
   * World for immersion (sensory detail)
   * World for challenge (hostile environment)
   * World for theme (reinforces message)
4. **What maintains world consistency?**

   * Internal logic (magic system rules, physics, society)
   * Tone consistency (grimdark vs heroic vs absurdist)
   * Canon tracking (what's true? what's established?)
   * Contradiction management (when to bend vs break)
5. **How do players interact with world?**

   * Interrogative (players ask questions, world answers)
   * Reactive (world responds to actions)
   * Collaborative (players contribute to world)
   * Pre-authored (world is fixed)

**Approach:**

* Case studies: Successful game worlds (Glorantha, Eberron, Burning Wheel's Burning, Blades' Doskvol)
* For each: What makes world serve the game?
* Analyze: What's pre-authored vs emergent?
* Consider: How would LLM change worldbuilding workflow?

### Fourth Focus: Balance

**Note on scenario constraints:** While analyzing balance, we'll also encounter scenario constraints (player time, session length, attention). These are NOT in-game resources and require different analytical tools. We'll identify where scenario constraints appear but develop separate frameworks for handling them.

**Initial questions:**

1. **Balance for what?**

   * Fairness (all players equal power)
   * Challenge (difficulty curve)
   * Pacing (tension and release)
   * Spotlight (everyone gets moments)
   * Verisimilitude (world feels real)
2. **What types of balance exist?**

   * Symmetric (all same options) vs Asymmetric (different but equal)
   * Static (balanced at design) vs Dynamic (balanced through play)
   * Competitive (zero-sum) vs Cooperative (everyone succeeds or fails together)
   * Internal (game mechanics) vs External (player skill)
3. **When does balance matter?**

   * PvP games (critical)
   * Tactical challenges (important)
   * Story games (less important, or different kind)
   * Exploration games (might be intentionally unbalanced)
4. **How do you detect imbalance?**

   * Dominant strategies (one approach always wins)
   * Player frustration (feels unfair)
   * Lack of tension (too easy or too hard)
   * Spotlight imbalance (some players irrelevant)
5. **How do LLMs affect balance?**

   * Dynamic difficulty adjustment
   * Personalized challenges
   * Detecting and correcting imbalance in real-time
   * Risk: LLM creates accidental imbalance

**Approach:**

* Study balance in different game types (MTG vs D\&D vs PbtA vs party games)
* Identify: What's being balanced and why?
* Analyze: How is balance achieved (design vs play vs meta)?
* Consider: What could LLMs balance dynamically?

## The Research Process

### How We'll Use This

**Step 1: Deep dive on concept** (e.g., "What is a game system?")

* Study existing theory and practice
* Analyze examples across different game types
* Identify patterns and anti-patterns
* Document findings

**Step 2: Apply to scenarios**

* For each scenario, ask: "What does this scenario need from \[game systems/worldbuilding/balance]?"
* Document requirements
* Identify commonalities and differences

**Step 3: Extract patterns**

* What approaches work across scenarios?
* What's scenario-specific vs generalizable?
* Where do LLMs add value?

**Step 4: Build framework**

* Decision trees (given X, choose Y)
* Design patterns (solutions to recurring problems)
* Evaluation criteria (how to know if it works)

**Step 5: Validate**

* Implement prototypes
* Test with real users
* Refine based on results

### Iterative, Not Linear

We won't complete all of "game systems" before moving to "worldbuilding." Instead:

* Start with one concept
* Apply to one scenario
* Learn what we need to know next
* Iterate

The scenarios drive what we need to understand, not abstract completeness.

## Critical Distinction: In-Game Resources vs Scenario Constraints

This is easy to conflate but doing so leads to confused frameworks. They require different tools.

### In-Game Resources

**Definition:** Elements tracked and managed WITHIN the game system that players make strategic decisions about.

**Examples:**

* **Tangible:** HP, ammo, gold, equipment durability
* **Abstract:** Stress, sanity, corruption, heat, momentum
* **Social:** Reputation, favors owed, NPC trust, influence, relationships
* **Knowledge:** Information as currency, secrets known
* **Meta:** Fate points, luck tokens, narrative control points

**Characteristics:**

* Tracked by the system (mechanically represented)
* Players make choices about spending/conserving
* Scarcity creates meaningful decisions
* Part of the fiction (represented in game world)
* Designed intentionally to create specific experiences

**Design questions:**

* What should be a resource for this purpose?
* How scarce should it be?
* What's the recovery cycle?
* How does it create the intended experience?

**Tools:**

* Mechanics design (how to track, spend, recover)
* Balance analysis (is scarcity appropriate?)
* Feedback loops (consequences of use)
* LLMs can track complex resource webs

### Scenario Constraints

**Definition:** External limitations ON the game that designers must work WITHIN, not managed by players through gameplay.

**Examples:**

* **Time:** Session length (2 hours), meeting frequency (monthly), campaign duration (12 sessions)
* **Attention:** Player cognitive load, how much complexity they can handle
* **Emotional:** Player safety, comfort with difficult content, trauma triggers
* **Social:** Number of players, group dynamics, player experience levels
* **Physical:** Play environment, tools available, accessibility needs

**Characteristics:**

* External to game system (not tracked mechanically)
* Not player choices (constraints they operate within)
* Real-world limitations (not fictional)
* Designer must accommodate, can't just "balance"
* Often non-negotiable (players truly do have 2 hours, not more)

**Design questions:**

* What constraints exist for this scenario?
* How do I design within them?
* What's negotiable vs fixed?
* How do constraints affect system design?

**Tools:**

* Scenario analysis (identify constraints)
* Adaptive design (work within limitations)
* Pacing systems (fit content to time)
* Safety tools (respect emotional boundaries)
* LLMs can adapt to constraints dynamically

### Why the Distinction Matters

**Conflating them leads to:**

* Trying to "balance" player time (nonsensical - you can't make players have more time)
* Treating emotional safety as tradeable resource (dangerous and unethical)
* Managing attention as in-game mechanic (category error)

**Keeping them separate leads to:**

* Clear thinking about what you're designing (mechanics vs accommodations)
* Right tools for right problems (balance vs adaptation)
* Better frameworks (in-game design vs scenario design)

**Example: Scenario 1 (Busy Adults)**

**Scenario constraints:**

* 2 hours per session (fixed, non-negotiable)
* Monthly frequency (fixed)
* Limited player memory across gaps (real limitation)

**Design response:**

* Episodic structure (accommodate time constraint)
* Strong recap system (accommodate memory limitation)
* Complete arcs per session (respect time commitment)

**Not a response:**

* "Balance" time (you can't)
* Make time an in-game resource (wrong category)
* Ignore constraints (players won't engage)

**In-game resources in this scenario:**

* HP, abilities, equipment (whatever system uses)
* Might be different BECAUSE of scenario constraints (simpler tracking due to time limits)
* But still in-game, not scenario-level

### How to Handle Each

**For in-game resources:**

1. Identify what should be resources for this purpose
2. Design tracking and management mechanics
3. Balance scarcity levels
4. Create recovery cycles
5. Test if resources create intended experience

**For scenario constraints:**

1. Identify constraints early (fixed vs negotiable)
2. Design system to work within constraints
3. Build adaptive mechanisms where needed
4. Test if design respects constraints
5. Document constraints for users

**Framework development:**

* Separate chapters/sections for each
* Different analytical tools for each
* Clear when discussing one vs the other
* Show how they interact (constraints affect resource design)

## Concrete Next Actions

### Immediate (Next Conversation)

**Starting point decided:**

* **Concept:** Game Systems (including resource management as component)
* **Test scenario:** Scenario 3 (Mystery Investigation) - clearest requirements, good for understanding resources
* **Approach:** Deep enough to extract patterns, then apply to another scenario

**Why this starting point:**

* Game systems are most fundamental (everything else builds on system)
* Mystery has concrete requirements (clue tracking, NPC state, interrogation, investigation resources)
* Easy to compare across implementations (Gumshoe vs D\&D vs custom)
* Clear success criteria (did players solve mystery?)
* Good test case for resource management (investigation points, NPC patience, time pressure)

**Next session goals:**

1. Deep dive: What is a game system?
2. Analyze: How do different systems handle mystery-solving?
3. Focus on: What resources matter for mystery games and why?
4. Identify: What would LLM enable?

### Short-term (Next Few Sessions)

1. **Deep dive: Game Systems**

   * What makes a system coherent?
   * What components are essential?
   * What role do in-game resources play?
   * Map purpose → system architecture
   * Apply to Scenario 3 (Mystery)
2. **Deep dive: Resource Management**

   * What resources matter for mystery-solving? (investigation points, NPC patience, time)
   * How does resource scarcity create decisions?
   * What resources would be valuable but too complex to track?
   * How do LLMs change what's feasible?
   * Distinguish: In-game resources vs scenario constraints
3. **Deep dive: Worldbuilding for Mystery**

   * What world details matter for mystery?
   * How do NPCs need to be modeled?
   * What consistency requirements exist?
   * How does LLM change what's possible?
4. **Deep dive: Balance in Mystery**

   * What needs to be balanced? (difficulty? pacing?)
   * How do you ensure fair play?
   * How do you prevent trivial solutions?
5. **Synthesize: Mystery System Framework**

   * Design patterns for mystery games
   * Resource management patterns
   * LLM architecture requirements
   * Evaluation criteria
   * Separate notes on scenario constraints (player time, attention)

### Medium-term (After First Scenario)

Repeat process for 2-3 more scenarios:

* Each reveals different requirements
* Each tests different aspects of framework
* Each adds to pattern library

Then synthesize across scenarios:

* What's universal?
* What's scenario-specific?
* What's the general framework?

## Questions to Answer Along the Way

### About Game Systems

* When should mechanics be explicit vs implicit?
* How granular should resolution be?
* What should be automated vs player-driven?
* How do you handle edge cases?

### About Worldbuilding

* How much should be pre-authored vs emergent?
* How do you maintain consistency at scale?
* When should world be fixed vs responsive?
* How do you balance detail vs playability?

### About Balance

* How do you balance across player skill levels?
* When should challenges be symmetric vs asymmetric?
* How do you prevent dominant strategies?

### About LLMs

* What should LLMs handle vs pre-authored content?
* How do you constrain LLM output appropriately?
* How do you detect and correct LLM mistakes?
* What's the human oversight model?

### About Evaluation

* How do you know if system serves its purpose?
* What metrics matter? (engagement? satisfaction? learning?)
* How do you test at scale?
* What's the validation process?

## Success Criteria for This Phase

**We'll know we're making progress when:**

1. **We can articulate design principles**

   * "For mystery games, you should..."
   * "When building world for exploration, consider..."
   * "Balance matters for X but not for Y because..."
2. **We can analyze existing systems**

   * Take any TTRPG, explain why it works (or doesn't) for its purpose
   * Identify what would need to change for different purpose
   * Predict how LLM would improve it
3. **We can design from scenarios**

   * Given new scenario, outline system requirements
   * Propose worldbuilding approach
   * Identify balance considerations
   * Describe LLM role
4. **We can extract patterns**

   * "This pattern works for scenarios X, Y, Z"
   * "This anti-pattern fails because..."
   * "This trade-off requires choosing between A and B"
5. **We have concrete artifacts**

   * Design frameworks (decision trees, pattern catalogs)
   * Implementation architectures (technical designs)
   * Evaluation methodologies (how to test)
   * Case studies (detailed scenario analyses)

## Why This Approach Works

### Grounded in Reality

* Scenarios are real problems, not theoretical exercises
* Solutions must actually work, not just sound good
* Framework emerges from practice, not pure theory

### Iterative and Adaptive

* Don't need to solve everything before starting
* Learn what matters through doing
* Refine based on what we discover

### Generalizable but Concrete

* Scenarios are specific (concrete)
* Patterns extracted are general (transferable)
* Framework bridges specific and general

### Student-Friendly

* Student works on scenarios that interest them
* Deep dives are focused and purposeful
* Clear deliverables at each stage
* Building toward thesis contribution

### Defensible for Committee

* Technical challenges are real and documented
* Solutions are validated through implementation
* Contributions are clearly articulated
* Generalization is demonstrated, not assumed

## Document Structure We're Building Toward

**Final Framework (Thesis) Structure:**

1. **Introduction:** Purpose-preserving adaptation in LLM-mediated game systems
2. **Foundations:** Game systems, worldbuilding, balance, emergence, adaptation
3. **Scenario Analysis:** Deep dives on 2-3 scenarios (requirements, solutions, patterns)
4. **Framework:** Design principles, patterns, architectures, evaluation
5. **Implementation:** Prototypes and validation
6. **Cross-Domain:** How lessons transfer (TTRPGs → video games → education)
7. **Conclusion:** Contributions, limitations, future work

**This document (bootstrapping) covers:** Getting from where we are (scenarios + concepts) to where we need to be (foundations + framework).

## Ready to Begin

**We've decided:**

1. **Starting concept:** Game Systems (with integrated resource management)
2. **Test scenario:** Mystery Investigation (Scenario 3)
3. **Depth approach:** Deep enough to extract patterns, then validate with second scenario

**Your confirmation needed:**

* Does this approach make sense?
* Any adjustments before we dive into "What is a Game System?"
* Ready to start the deep dive?
