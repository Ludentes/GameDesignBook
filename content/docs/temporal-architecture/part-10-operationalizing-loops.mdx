# Part 10: Operationalizing Loops - From Architecture to Implementation

You've identified your aesthetic goals. You understand loop scales. You've chosen an investment trajectory and designed stopping points. Now comes the critical question: **"What do I actually build?"**

This section bridges the gap between temporal architecture decisions and concrete system design. We'll show how loop choices constrain your parameter space, which system functions must operate at which scales, and provide step-by-step processes for deriving components from temporal decisions.

**The operational principle:** Every temporal architecture decision narrows your design space. A 30-second micro loop requires different mechanics than a 5-minute micro loop. A 30-minute macro loop requires different content than a 6-hour macro loop. By understanding these constraints, you move from abstract loop diagrams to concrete, buildable systems.

## Loop Scale → Required System Functions

Different loop scales require different system functions to operate effectively. Understanding which functions must work at which scales prevents building unnecessary complexity or missing critical infrastructure.

### System Functions Recap (from Chapter 1)

1. **Adjudication** - Resolving uncertainty (dice, algorithms, GM fiat, LLM)
2. **Information Management** - Controlling what players know and when
3. **Content Generation** - Creating situations, encounters, challenges
4. **State Persistence** - Tracking what carries over between loops
5. **Cognitive Encoding** - Shaping how players think about the game
6. **Constraint Design** - Creating meaningful limitations
7. **Procedural Content for Solo Play** - Automated opposition/narrative

### Micro Loop (Seconds to Minutes)

**Primary Functions Required:**

**Adjudication (CRITICAL):**

* **Speed requirement:** Must be instant or near-instant
* **Why:** Micro loops repeat hundreds of times per session—slow resolution destroys flow
* **Implementation options:**
  * Instant algorithmic (Vampire Survivors: hitbox collision → damage)
  * Sub-second calculation (XCOM: hit% displayed instantly)
  * Player skill-based (Dark Souls: did you time the parry? Physics resolves instantly)
* **Red flag:** Complex calculations taking >1 second per micro action (breaks flow)

**Example: Vampire Survivors**

* Adjudication: Pure algorithmic, zero player input
* Hitbox collision calculates instantly
* Damage numbers appear immediately
* No waiting for resolution
* Result: Can process 100+ adjudications per minute without breaking flow

**Example: Red Dead Redemption 2 (PROBLEM)**

* Adjudication: Realistic animations required for resolution
* Looting requires 8-second animation
* Player waits for adjudication to complete
* 50 looting actions per session = 6.6 minutes watching
* Result: Adjudication speed breaks micro-loop flow

**Information Management (IMPORTANT):**

* **Visibility requirement:** Immediate, clear feedback
* **Why:** Players need to understand micro-loop results instantly to make next decision
* **Implementation:**
  * Damage numbers (how much did that hurt?)
  * Audio cues (hit sound vs. miss sound)
  * Visual state changes (enemy staggers, resources increment)
  * UI updates (health bar, ammo count)
* **Red flag:** Hidden information that requires inference slows micro loops

**Content Generation (VARIES BY AESTHETIC):**

* **Discovery aesthetic:** High-frequency generation needed (each micro loop should present something new)
* **Challenge aesthetic:** Consistent patterns needed (same enemies, learnable behaviors)
* **Mastery aesthetic:** Deterministic preferred (removes randomness from execution)
* **Implementation depends on aesthetic—not all micro loops need content generation**

**Cognitive Encoding (SUBTLE BUT IMPORTANT):**

* **Micro loops encode what actions are possible and valuable**
* **Why:** Players learn the "language" of your game through micro interactions
* If attack always works, players learn "attacking is primary verb"
* If stealth is rewarded, players learn "avoid combat when possible"
* If resources are scarce, players learn "conserve ammunition"

**Functions NOT Required at Micro Scale:**

* ❌ **State Persistence:** Micro loops typically don't save—state persists in RAM during play
* ❌ **Constraint Design:** Constraints operate at meso/macro scale (micro just executes within constraints)
* ❌ **Procedural Content for Solo Play:** Usually operates at meso/macro scale (generating missions, not moment-to-moment)

### Meso Loop (Minutes to Half Hour)

**Primary Functions Required:**

**Information Management (CRITICAL):**

* **Clarity requirement:** Players must understand current goal and progress toward it
* **Why:** Meso loops are where "what am I doing?" is answered—confusion here kills engagement
* **Implementation:**
  * Objective markers (quest logs, waypoints, mini-map indicators)
  * Progress bars (10/15 clues found, 3/5 checkpoints)
  * Visual feedback (area unlocked, boss health bar appears)
  * Narrative framing (dialogue explaining current goal)
* **Red flag:** Players asking "what should I do now?" during meso loop = info management failure

**Example: Hades**

* Clear room → see reward preview for next rooms → choose path
* Always know: Current room type, reward options, chambers until boss
* Information always visible, never ambiguous
* Result: Players always have clear meso-loop goal

**Example: Early No Man's Sky (PROBLEM)**

* Land on planet → gather resources → ??? → profit?
* No clear meso-loop objective beyond "survive"
* Information about what resources do or why you need them unclear
* Result: Players wander aimlessly, meso loop feels pointless

**Content Generation (OFTEN REQUIRED):**

* **Need sufficient variety for 10-20 meso iterations per session**
* **Implementation options:**
  * Procedural generation (Slay the Spire: different enemies per floor)
  * Authored content pool with rotation (Destiny 2: strike playlist)
  * Remixing systems (Into the Breach: same missions, different terrain/enemies)
  * Player-generated variety (Mario Maker: community levels)
* **Formula approximation:** If meso loop repeats N times per session, need variety for N iterations without obvious repetition
  * N \< 5: Can use entirely authored content
  * 5 \< N \< 20: Need remixing or procedural elements
  * N > 20: Require strong procedural generation or infinite player-generated content

**State Persistence (IMPORTANT):**

* **Must track progress within meso loop**
* **Why:** Players need to see advancement toward meso goal, may need to resume mid-loop
* **Implementation:**
  * Checkpoints within meso loops (autosave after each encounter)
  * Progress tracking (collectibles found, enemies defeated)
  * State that survives micro failures (damage to boss persists even if you die)
* **Scope:** Usually in-RAM during session, may persist to disk for resume

**Cognitive Encoding (SHAPES STRATEGY):**

* **Meso loops encode strategic priorities**
* Players learn what matters over time:
  * Which resources are actually important (most are noise)
  * Which build paths are viable (experimentation at meso scale)
  * Which tactical approaches work (learn from meso-loop failures)

**Constraint Design (CREATES TACTICAL DEPTH):**

* **Meso loops are where constraints create interesting decisions**
* Resource limitations (limited potions, spell slots, ammunition)
* Action limitations (turns per encounter, time per mission)
* Capability limitations (can't access all tools yet, must work within current loadout)

**Functions SOMETIMES Required:**

* **Adjudication:** May need complex resolution at meso scale (boss fights with phases, complex encounters)
* **Procedural Content for Solo Play:** Solo games need automated opposition at meso scale (dungeon generation, enemy AI)

**Functions NOT Required:**

* ❌ **State Persistence across sessions:** Meso loops typically complete within session (persist to macro if needed)

### Macro Loop (Session to Run)

**Primary Functions Required:**

**State Persistence (CRITICAL):**

* **Must track what carries over between macro loops**
* **Why:** Macro loops often span multiple sessions—forgetting progress is catastrophic
* **Implementation:**
  * Save systems (full game state to disk)
  * Cloud saves (progress across devices)
  * Session recaps (remind player what they were doing)
  * Progression tracking (campaign progress, unlocks earned)
* **Scope:** Permanent storage, must survive weeks/months between sessions

**Example: Civilization VI**

* Every turn = state change
* Must track: Every unit position, every building, every diplomatic relationship, tech progress, etc.
* Thousands of state variables
* Save/load works perfectly (complex but essential)

**Example: Anthem (PROBLEM)**

* Progress frequently lost due to bugs
* Disconnects could erase mission progress
* State persistence failures destroyed player trust
* Result: Players afraid to invest time (might lose progress)

**Information Management (HELPS RESUMPTION):**

* **Need to rebuild mental model after break**
* **Why:** Players forget details between sessions—need reminders
* **Implementation:**
  * "Previously on..." recaps (story games)
  * Journal/quest log with context (RPGs)
  * Clear objective markers on load (waypoints, next steps)
  * Tutorial reminders after long absence (re-explain complex mechanics)
* **Red flag:** Loading save from weeks ago and having no idea what you were doing

**Content Generation (DEPENDS ON REPLAYABILITY GOALS):**

* **Single playthrough games:** Can use entirely authored content (30-60 hours of unique content)
* **Replayable games:** Need generation systems for variety across macro loops
  * Roguelikes: Procedural generation + authored encounters
  * Strategy games: Procedural maps + authored scenarios
  * Multiplayer: Other players provide variety

**Constraint Design (DEFINES MACRO VICTORY CONDITIONS):**

* **Macro loops need clear completion conditions**
* Implementation:
  * Victory conditions (defeat final boss, reach ending, win the match)
  * Failure conditions (permadeath, time limit, lose condition)
  * Optional challenges (achievements, hard mode, speedrun targets)

**Functions SOMETIMES Required:**

* **Adjudication:** May need for macro-scale resolution (campaign outcomes, faction victories)
* **Cognitive Encoding:** Teaches long-term strategic thinking (what matters for macro victory)

**Functions LESS Critical:**

* **Procedural Content for Solo Play:** May not need if macro loop is short enough to author entirely

### Meta Loop (Between Sessions)

**Primary Functions Required:**

**State Persistence (LONG-TERM TRACKING):**

* **Must track progression across many macro loops**
* **Why:** Meta loops are about long-term investment—losing meta progress is devastating
* **Implementation:**
  * Account-level progression (unlocks, achievements, rankings)
  * Cloud-based storage (persist across devices, survive reinstalls)
  * Import/export (player can backup progress)
  * Platform achievements (Steam, PlayStation, Xbox)
* **Scope:** Permanent, must survive years potentially

**Content Generation (FOR REPLAYABILITY):**

* **Need reasons to play another macro loop**
* **Implementation:**
  * Procedural variety (different maps, different challenges)
  * Authored variety (different characters, different strategies)
  * Community content (user-generated levels, mods)
  * Competitive variety (different opponents, meta-game evolution)
* **Without variety, meta loop becomes repetitive grind**

**Cognitive Encoding (SHAPES IDENTITY):**

* **Meta loops encode player identity within community**
* "I'm a Diamond Rocket League player" (ranking system)
* "I beat Dark Souls at SL1" (challenge achievements)
* "I have all the achievements" (completionist identity)
* Meta progression should support desired player identities

**Functions SOMETIMES Required:**

* **Information Management:** Might need cross-loop tracking (statistics, progress bars)
* **Constraint Design:** Could add meta-constraints (seasonal rules, challenge modes)

**Functions NOT Required:**

* ❌ **Adjudication:** Meta loops don't need moment-to-moment resolution
* ❌ **Procedural Content for Solo Play:** Operates at macro level, not meta

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Adjudication**           | CRITICAL (instant)             | Important (complex OK)        | Sometimes                | Not needed           |

### Design Implications

**When designing micro loops, prioritize:**

1. Adjudication speed (instant or near-instant)
2. Feedback clarity (immediate, understandable)
3. If micro repeats >100 times/session, every millisecond of delay matters

**When designing meso loops, prioritize:**

1. Goal clarity (always know what you're doing)
2. Progress visibility (can see advancement)
3. Content variety (enough for 10-20 iterations)

**When designing macro loops, prioritize:**

1. Save/resume functionality (can't lose hours of progress)
2. Session recaps (rebuild mental model after break)
3. Clear completion conditions (know when macro loop is done)

**When designing meta loops, prioritize:**

1. Long-term progression tracking (permanent, cloud-based)
2. Replayability systems (reasons to play another macro loop)
3. Identity support (rankings, achievements, social recognition)

## Loop Duration → Parameter Constraints

Loop timing directly constrains your parameter space. A 30-second micro loop requires different numbers than a 5-minute micro loop. Understanding these mathematical relationships helps you set parameters that create intended pacing.

### The Core Constraint Equation

```
Total Experience Time = Σ(Action Duration × Action Frequency × Session Count)
```

**Every parameter must fit within this constraint:**

* If your macro loop is 30 minutes, and players repeat 50 micro actions, each micro action has 36 seconds budget (30 min / 50 actions)
* If each micro action includes 5-second animation, that's 4.2 minutes of animation watching (14% of session)
* Is 14% acceptable? For simulation aesthetic, maybe. For action aesthetic, no.

### Hard Time Caps Enable Mathematical Derivation

**When you set a hard time limit, you can calculate parameters:**

**Example: Vampire Survivors (30-minute cap)**

**Given:**

* Macro loop: 30 minutes (hard cap)
* Meso loop: Level-ups every 60-90 seconds
* Desired: \~20 level-ups per run

**Derive:**

* Average level-up interval: 30 minutes / 20 level-ups = 90 seconds
* XP required must scale: Early (fast level-ups) → Late (slow level-ups)
* XP scaling formula: Each level requires \~15% more XP than previous
* Result: Level 1 at 30s, Level 10 at 90s, Level 20 at 180s intervals

**Enemy scaling:**

* Must reach "screen full" by minute 20-25 (creates pressure)
* Spawn rate must increase: Early (few enemies) → Late (hundreds)
* Spawn rate formula: Increase by 5% per minute
* Minute 1: 10 enemies/minute → Minute 25: 33 enemies/minute

**Player power scaling:**

* Must scale slightly slower than enemy power (creates late-game pressure)
* If enemies scale at 1.05^minute, player scales at \~1.04^level-up
* Result: Early game easy (player stronger), late game hard (enemies catch up)

**Example: FTL (Flagship Fight)**

**Given:**

* Macro loop: 60-90 minutes to reach flagship
* Flagship fight: Must take 10-20 minutes (climax)
* Flagship has 3 phases

**Derive:**

* Each phase: 3-7 minutes
* Flagship health pool: Must survive 3-7 minutes of player DPS
* If player DPS = 10 damage/second, flagship needs 1,800-4,200 HP per phase
* Flagship healing: Must recover \~20% HP between phases (extends fight)
* Result: Phase 1 = 2,000 HP, Phase 2 = 2,500 HP, Phase 3 = 3,000 HP (accounts for player upgrades)

### Long Loops Require Fast Micro Loops

**Constraint:** If macro loop is long, micro loops must be very fast or players exhaust attention.

**Example: Civilization VI**

**Given:**

* Macro loop: 300 turns (4-12 hours depending on speed)
* Players must maintain engagement for entire macro loop

**Derive:**

* Micro loop (turn): Must be \<2 minutes average
* If turns took 5 minutes each: 300 × 5 min = 25 hours (unacceptable)
* Target: 1-2 minutes per turn = 5-10 hours (acceptable for hardcore audience)

**This constrains parameters:**

* Animation speed: Each action \<2 seconds (unit movement, building construction)
* Decision complexity: Each turn can't require >5-10 decisions (too slow)
* Information density: Can't show everything (would take too long to read)
* AI turn speed: Must process quickly (players waiting kills pacing)

**Red flag examples:**

* Civ V late-game: AI turns take 2-5 minutes (breaks flow, nothing player can do)
* X-COM 2: Long enemy animation turns (players waiting 30+ seconds)
* These break the constraint: Micro loops too slow for macro loop length

### The Animation-Frequency Formula

**Critical relationship for realistic/simulation games:**

```
Total Animation Time = Animation Length × Action Frequency × Session Duration
```

**Acceptable thresholds (approximate):**

* \<5% of session time: Barely noticeable
* 5-10%: Noticeable but acceptable for simulation aesthetic
* 10-15%: Frustrating for action players, OK for simulation fans
* > 15%: Universally frustrating (too much watching, not enough playing)

**Example: Red Dead Redemption 2**

**Given:**

* Looting animation: 8 seconds
* Skinning animation: 6 seconds
* Average session: 2 hours (120 minutes)
* Looting frequency: 50 times per session
* Skinning frequency: 20 times per session

**Calculate:**

* Looting time: 8s × 50 = 400 seconds (6.7 minutes)
* Skinning time: 6s × 20 = 120 seconds (2 minutes)
* Total animation time: 8.7 minutes
* Percentage: 8.7 / 120 = 7.25%

**Analysis:**

* 7.25% is borderline (noticeable but not catastrophic)
* BUT: These are just looting/skinning—doesn't include crafting, horse mounting, drawer opening, etc.
* All animations combined likely >15% (frustrating for action players)

**Design implications:**

**If action frequency is HIGH (>10 per session):**

* Animation must be \<1 second
* Or make action less frequent
* Or provide skip option

**If action frequency is MODERATE (10-50 per session):**

* Animation can be 2-5 seconds
* Still adds up if multiple action types

**If action frequency is LOW (\<10 per session):**

* Animation can be longer (even 10+ seconds acceptable)
* Rare actions can have ceremony

**Action Frequency Table:**

| Frequency      | Max Animation Length | Example Actions                 |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| >100/session   | \<0.5 seconds        | Shooting, attacking, jumping    |
| 50-100/session | 0.5-1 second         | Picking up items, opening doors |
| 20-50/session  | 1-3 seconds          | Looting, crafting common items  |
| 10-20/session  | 3-5 seconds          | Cutscenes for story beats       |
| \<10/session   | 5-10 seconds         | Boss intros, major unlocks      |

### Recovery Rates Determine Pacing Pattern

**Critical parameter:** Recovery speed is PRIMARY determinant of pacing pattern (from Chapter 4: Balance).

**The relationship:**

**Fast Recovery (seconds):**

* Creates Episodic or Continuous pacing
* Each encounter self-contained
* Examples: Modern shooters (health regenerates in 5 seconds), Hades (health recovers between rooms)
* Loop implication: Meso loops can be aggressive (consequences don't accumulate)

**Moderate Recovery (minutes to session):**

* Creates Wave pacing
* Resources deplete across several encounters, recover at checkpoints
* Examples: Dark Souls (Estus limited, recovers at bonfire), XCOM (injuries heal between missions)
* Loop implication: Meso loops create tension (using resources), macro loops provide relief (checkpoint reached)

**Slow Recovery (between sessions or permanent):**

* Creates Attrition pacing
* Decisions compound across entire session
* Examples: Old D\&D (spell slots daily), XCOM soldiers (injuries permanent)
* Loop implication: Macro loops build pressure over hours (can't recover mid-session)

**No Recovery (permanent loss):**

* Creates extreme Attrition
* Every mistake matters forever
* Examples: Permadeath, destroyed units, consumed items
* Loop implication: Macro loops are high-stakes (no margin for error)

**Design Process:**

1. **Choose desired pacing pattern** (based on aesthetic)
2. **Set recovery speed to create that pattern:**
   * Want Episodic? → Fast recovery (5-30 seconds)
   * Want Wave? → Moderate recovery (5-15 minutes)
   * Want Attrition? → Slow recovery (session-length or permanent)
3. **Set resource pool size to match recovery:**
   * Fast recovery → Small pools (regenerate quickly anyway)
   * Slow recovery → Large pools (must last longer)

**Example: Dark Souls vs. Modern Shooters**

**Dark Souls (Attrition pacing):**

* Estus Flask: 5-10 uses (small pool)
* Recovery: Only at bonfire (slow, 15-30 minutes between)
* Result: Pressure builds across area, relief at bonfire

**Call of Duty (Episodic pacing):**

* Health: Regenerates to full
* Recovery: 5 seconds behind cover (fast)
* Result: Each fight self-contained, aggressive play rewarded

**Same resource (health), different parameters, completely different pacing and feel.**

### Tension Gradient Parameters

**Tension gradient** describes how intensity changes over time. Parameters create this gradient.

**Escalating Tension (most games):**

* Enemy difficulty increases: More health, more damage, new abilities
* Resource scarcity increases: Ammunition dwindles, supplies run low
* Time pressure increases: Deadlines approach, pursuers close in
* Parameter trajectory: Gradual increase from start to climax

**Example: Alien Isolation**

* Alien behavior: Learns from player tactics over time
* Resources: Supplies become scarcer in later areas
* Safe spaces: Fewer and farther between
* Result: Tension escalates across 15-hour campaign

**Cyclical Tension (wave pacing):**

* Build phase: Pressure increases
* Peak phase: Maximum intensity
* Relief phase: Pressure releases
* Repeat cycle
* Parameter trajectory: Sine wave pattern

**Example: Left 4 Dead 2 AI Director**

* Build: Common infected increase
* Peak: Tank/Witch spawns
* Relief: Safe room reached, supplies available
* Cycle duration: 5-10 minutes
* Result: Natural rhythm of tension/release

**Flat Tension (submission aesthetic):**

* Difficulty stays constant (or decreases)
* Resources stay abundant
* No time pressure
* Parameter trajectory: Flat or declining

**Example: Vampire Survivors (after first 5 minutes)**

* Difficulty increases, but player power increases faster
* Player becomes overwhelming by minute 10
* Last 10 minutes are cathartic slaughter, not challenge
* Result: Meditative flow state

**Parameter Knobs for Tension:**

1. **Enemy stats:** Health, damage, speed, aggression
2. **Enemy quantity:** Numbers per encounter
3. **Resource availability:** Ammo, health, crafting materials
4. **Time constraints:** Deadlines, pursuit speed
5. **Safe spaces:** Frequency, capacity

**Design implication:** Plot your intended tension curve, then adjust these parameters to create it.

### Session Length and Content Requirements

**Constraint:** Total content needed scales with session length and loop repetition.

**Formula (approximate):**

```
Content Pieces Needed = (Session Length / Meso Loop Duration) × Desired Variety Factor
```

**Where Variety Factor:**

* 0.5 = Can repeat with minimal variation (Tetris, same pieces)
* 1.0 = Need unique content each meso loop (story missions)
* 2.0 = Need excess variety to feel unpredictable (roguelikes)

**Example: 2-hour session, 15-minute meso loops, Variety Factor = 1.5**

* Meso loops per session: 120 min / 15 min = 8 loops
* Content needed: 8 × 1.5 = 12 unique meso experiences
* If game has 50-hour campaign: 50 hours / 2 hours = 25 sessions
* Total meso content: 25 × 12 = 300 unique meso experiences needed

**This is why games use:**

* **Procedural generation:** Create variety without authoring 300 missions
* **Remixing systems:** 50 mission types × 6 environments = 300 combinations
* **Player-generated content:** Community creates infinite variety
* **Replayability through skill:** Same content, different execution (fighting games, speedruns)

### Summary: Loop Duration → Parameters

**Key relationships:**

1. **Hard time caps enable calculation:** 30-min run → enemy scaling rate derivable
2. **Long macro loops require fast micro loops:** 300-turn game → sub-2-minute turns required
3. **Animation frequency × length = total watching time:** Keep below 10% for action games
4. **Recovery speed determines pacing:** Fast = Episodic, Slow = Attrition
5. **Tension gradient requires parameter escalation:** Enemy stats, resource scarcity, time pressure
6. **Content needs scale with session length:** Longer sessions need more variety

**For numerical targets and detailed measurables, see Chapter 4: Balance, Part 5 (Measurables Catalog).**

## Aesthetic Goal → Loop Architecture → Component Requirements

This is the complete design process: starting with aesthetic goals, deriving loop requirements, then deriving concrete component specifications. We'll work through multiple examples showing the full chain of reasoning.

### The Design Process (5 Steps)

**Step 1:** Identify aesthetic goal(s) and target player capacity
**Step 2:** Derive loop architecture requirements from aesthetic
**Step 3:** Derive component requirements from loop architecture
**Step 4:** Validate configuration coherence
**Step 5:** Prototype and test

### Worked Example 1: Challenge Aesthetic for Midcore Players

#### Step 1: Aesthetic Goal + Player Capacity

**Primary Aesthetic:** Challenge (overcoming difficulty through skill development)
**Secondary Aesthetics:** Mastery (deep understanding), Progression (visible growth)
**Target Players:** Midcore (30-90 min sessions, 10-20 hours/week capacity)

**From Players & Contexts section:**

* Time: 30-90 minutes per session, 3-5 sessions per week
* Cognitive capacity: Moderate (can handle 5-7 systems)
* Investment tolerance: Learning Curve pattern (high initial, decreases through mastery)

#### Step 2: Loop Architecture Requirements

**Derive from Challenge aesthetic (Part 3):**

* Micro loops must be consistent (enables pattern learning)
* Meso loops must provide skill tests with clear success/failure
* Macro loops must feel like earned achievement
* Meta loops should enable mastery expression

**Derive from Midcore capacity:**

* Macro loops: 30-60 minutes (matches session length)
* Meso loops: 5-15 minutes (multiple per session)
* Micro loops: 30-90 seconds (tight enough for flow)
* Meta loops: Intrinsic motivation only (no daily obligations)

**Derived Loop Architecture:**

**Micro loop (30-60 seconds):** Combat encounter

* Consistent enemy patterns (learnable through repetition)
* Skill-based execution (timing, spacing, pattern recognition)
* Clear success/failure (enemy defeated or you took damage)
* Duration enables flow state (fast enough to maintain engagement)

**Meso loop (10-15 minutes):** Area section with checkpoint at end

* Multiple micro loops build toward checkpoint
* Increasing difficulty (later encounters harder)
* Checkpoint provides relief and progress save
* Clear goal (reach next checkpoint/bonfire)

**Macro loop (45-60 minutes):** Defeat major boss, unlock new area

* 3-5 meso loops build toward boss
* Boss is ultimate skill test (must master micro loops to win)
* Victory unlocks significant new content
* Clear session-appropriate endpoint

**Meta loop (20-40 hours):** Master combat system, defeat all challenges

* Optional hard mode / NG+ for mastery expression
* Achievements for specific skill demonstrations
* Speedrun potential (community emerges organically)
* No FOMO, no dailies (play at own pace)

**Investment Trajectory:** Learning Curve

* Micro: High initially (learning controls, patterns), Low after mastery (muscle memory)
* Meso: Moderate consistent (tactical decisions)
* Macro: Moderate consistent (strategic planning)
* Meta: Low (optional depth for dedicated players)

#### Step 3: Component Requirements

**Mechanics (what you can do):**

**Derived from loop architecture:**

* Micro loops need consistent patterns → Mechanics must be deterministic
* Skill-based execution → Mechanics must have tight input→output mapping
* 30-60 second encounters → Mechanics must enable that TTK (time-to-kill)

**Derived from Challenge aesthetic:**

* Must reward skill → Mechanics need precise timing windows (parry, dodge, counter)
* Must teach through failure → Mechanics telegraph enemy attacks (wind-up animations)
* Must differentiate skill levels → Mechanics have depth (canceling, combos, advanced techniques)

**Implementation Example (Dark Souls-style):**

* **Light attack:** Fast (0.5s), low damage, safe
* **Heavy attack:** Slow (1.5s), high damage, risky
* **Dodge roll:** 0.5s animation, i-frames (invulnerability frames) if timed perfectly
* **Parry:** 0.3s window, if successful → riposte (massive damage)
* **Block:** Reduces damage, drains stamina
* **Stamina system:** Limits action spam, rewards measured play

**Why these mechanics serve Challenge:**

* Timing matters (i-frames, parry windows)
* Risk/reward tradeoffs (heavy attack is risky but rewarding)
* Depth for mastery (parry is optional but optimal)
* Consistency enables learning (same input always produces same output)

**Parameters (how much, how fast, how scarce):**

**Derived from loop duration:**

* Micro loop = 30-60 seconds → Enemy health must die in that timeframe
* If player DPS = 100 damage/minute, enemy health = 50-100 HP per enemy
* Boss fight = 5-10 minutes → Boss health = 500-1000 HP

**Derived from Challenge aesthetic:**

* Must feel earned → Enemy damage high (mistakes punish)
* Must allow learning → Recovery slow (consequences persist)
* Must reward skill → Execution-based damage (parries do 3× normal damage)

**Derived from investment pattern (Learning Curve):**

* Initial learning phase should hurt → Early enemies 2-shot you (learn to dodge)
* Mastery should feel powerful → Late game, can no-damage enemies (skill expression)
* But power scaling should be minimal → Stats increase 50%, skill improvement is 200%+

**Implementation Example:**

* **Player Health:** 100 HP (20 hits from basic enemy)
* **Recovery:** Slow (Estus Flask: 5 uses, recovers 50% HP, only refills at checkpoint)
* **Enemy Damage:**
  * Basic enemy: 5-10 damage per hit
  * Elite enemy: 15-25 damage per hit
  * Boss: 30-50 damage per hit (2-3 mistakes = death)
* **Enemy Health:**
  * Basic enemy: 50-80 HP (6-8 hits)
  * Elite enemy: 150-250 HP (15-25 hits)
  * Boss: 1,500-2,000 HP (150-200 hits, 5-10 minutes)
* **Stamina:**
  * Pool: 100 stamina
  * Attack cost: Light 10, Heavy 25, Dodge 20
  * Regeneration: 25 stamina/second
  * Full recovery: 4 seconds (creates rhythm—can't spam)

**Why these parameters serve Challenge:**

* High enemy damage makes mistakes costly (creates tension)
* Slow recovery creates attrition pacing (pressure builds)
* Boss health requires sustained execution (marathon, not sprint)
* Stamina system prevents button mashing (must think about actions)

**Context (what it means):**

**Derived from Challenge aesthetic:**

* Must frame struggle as heroic (not futile)
* Must explain difficulty (not arbitrary)
* Must make victory meaningful (not trivial)

**Derived from player capacity (Midcore):**

* Should use familiar genre (adults understand dark fantasy conventions)
* Should have clear visual language (enemy types visually distinct)

**Implementation Example:**

* **Setting:** Dark fantasy, fallen kingdom
* **Player role:** Undead warrior, can't truly die (explains respawning)
* **Enemy types:** Visually distinct (hollow soldiers, knights, demons)
* **Boss context:** Named characters with lore (not "Boss #3")
* **Victory meaning:** Restore kingdom, break curse (clear goal)

**Why this context serves Challenge:**

* Undead nature explains retry mechanics (not breaking immersion)
* Dark fantasy justifies difficulty (harsh world, everything wants you dead)
* Named bosses make victories feel meaningful (defeated Captain Smough, not Generic Boss)
* Clear goal provides motivation (restore kingdom = purpose beyond "beat game")

**Pacing (when things happen):**

**Derived from loop architecture:**

* Micro loops continuous during area → Attrition pacing within meso
* Meso loops have relief at checkpoints → Wave pacing overall
* Macro loops escalate to boss → Tension gradient across 45-60 minutes

**Derived from Challenge aesthetic:**

* Must build pressure → Difficulty increases as you approach checkpoint
* Must provide relief → Checkpoints are safe (can level up, rest)
* Must create climax → Boss fight is peak intensity

**Derived from investment pattern:**

* Micro investment decreases → As you master area, can focus on exploration/lore
* Pressure releases → Checkpoint reached = exhale moment

**Implementation Example:**

* **Encounter density:**
  * Early area: 3-5 enemies per encounter, 30 seconds between
  * Mid area: 5-8 enemies per encounter, 15 seconds between
  * Boss approach: 8-10 enemies per encounter, no breaks
* **Checkpoint spacing:**
  * 10-15 minutes between checkpoints (meso loop duration)
  * Must fight through 20-30 enemies to reach checkpoint
  * Checkpoint = bonfire (can rest, level up, replenish Estus)
* **Boss pacing:**
  * Phase 1 (5 minutes): Learn attack patterns
  * Phase 2 (3-4 minutes): New attacks, increased aggression
  * Phase 3 (optional, 2-3 minutes): Desperate phase, all-out assault

**Why this pacing serves Challenge:**

* Attrition within area creates mounting pressure (resources depleting)
* Checkpoints provide relief without trivializing (still lost Estus charges)
* Boss phases create escalation (can't relax even when winning)
* Spacing respects midcore session length (can reach checkpoint in one session)

#### Step 4: Validate Configuration Coherence

**Test:** Do all components and loop scales serve Challenge aesthetic for midcore players?

**Mechanics:**

* ✅ Skill-based (timing, spacing, pattern recognition)
* ✅ Consistent (same input → same output, enables learning)
* ✅ Depth (parry, combos for mastery players)
* **Serves Challenge: YES**

**Parameters:**

* ✅ High enemy damage (mistakes costly)
* ✅ Slow recovery (consequences persist)
* ✅ Boss health requires sustained execution
* **Serves Challenge: YES**

**Context:**

* ✅ Dark fantasy frames struggle as heroic
* ✅ Undead lore explains retry mechanics
* ✅ Named bosses make victories meaningful
* **Serves Challenge: YES**

**Pacing:**

* ✅ Attrition within area (pressure builds)
* ✅ Wave overall (checkpoint relief)
* ✅ Escalation to boss (climax)
* **Serves Challenge: YES**

**Loop Architecture:**

* ✅ Micro loops consistent (pattern learning)
* ✅ Meso loops appropriate for midcore (10-15 min)
* ✅ Macro loops session-appropriate (45-60 min)
* ✅ Meta loops intrinsic (no FOMO)
* **Matches player capacity: YES**

**Investment Trajectory:**

* ✅ Learning Curve (high micro initially, decreases with mastery)
* ✅ Moderate meso/macro (tactical/strategic thinking)
* ✅ Low meta (optional depth)
* **Matches capacity and aesthetic: YES**

**Configuration Coherence: PASSED**

* All components pull in same direction
* Challenge aesthetic served at all scales
* Midcore capacity respected
* Result: This is Dark Souls

#### Step 5: Prototype Order

**Build in this order:**

1. **Micro loop FIRST (most critical):**
   * Implement: Light attack, heavy attack, dodge, enemy
   * Test: Does combat feel good? Timing satisfying? Clear feedback?
   * Iterate: Adjust hit stun, stamina costs, attack speeds until flow emerges
   * Success metric: Can fight same enemy 10 times and not get bored

2. **Meso loop structure:**
   * Implement: String together 10-15 encounters toward checkpoint
   * Test: Does difficulty ramp? Does pressure build? Is checkpoint relief satisfying?
   * Iterate: Adjust enemy placement, encounter spacing, checkpoint position
   * Success metric: 10-15 minutes feels complete, stopping at checkpoint feels good

3. **Macro loop (boss):**
   * Implement: Boss with 2-3 phases, health pool, attack patterns
   * Test: Does victory feel earned? Is it too easy/hard? Right duration?
   * Iterate: Adjust boss health, damage, phase transitions until 5-10 minutes
   * Success metric: Victory feels triumphant, want to tackle next challenge

4. **Meta loop (minimal initially):**
   * Implement: Stats that increase (HP, damage), maybe weapon upgrades
   * Test: Does progression help but not trivialize? Does it reward exploration?
   * Iterate: Adjust scaling so progression helps \~20-30% (skill still primary)
   * Success metric: Feel slightly stronger but still challenged

**What to measure during testing:**

* Micro: Deaths per checkpoint (should decrease as player learns)
* Meso: Time to checkpoint (should stay consistent—difficulty compensates for skill)
* Macro: Boss attempts (3-10 attempts typical for fair difficulty)
* Meta: Completion rate (60-70% of players should finish if they reach 5-hour mark)

### Worked Example 2: Discovery Aesthetic for Casual Players

#### Step 1: Aesthetic Goal + Player Capacity

**Primary Aesthetic:** Discovery (exploration, finding secrets, understanding mysteries)
**Secondary Aesthetics:** Narrative (story intrigue)
**Target Players:** Casual (5-30 min sessions, 1-5 hours/week capacity)

**From Players & Contexts:**

* Time: 5-30 minutes per session, can't commit to long campaigns
* Cognitive capacity: Low (can only track 3-5 systems)
* Investment tolerance: Flat Low (minimal learning curve, stays simple)

#### Step 2: Loop Architecture Requirements

**Derive from Discovery aesthetic:**

* Micro loops must present variety (each action reveals something new)
* Meso loops must unlock new areas/information
* Macro loops should recontextualize earlier discoveries
* Meta loops enable deeper exploration for dedicated players

**Derive from Casual capacity:**

* Macro loops: 15-30 minutes MAX (matches session length)
* Meso loops: 5-10 minutes (1-3 per session)
* Micro loops: 30-60 seconds (simple, not complex)
* Meta loops: Optional (can complete game without engaging meta)

**Derived Loop Architecture:**

**Micro loop (30-60 seconds):** Examine object → Get clue → Update knowledge

* Simple interaction (click/tap to examine)
* Immediate information (clue appears instantly)
* Variety (each object teaches something new)

**Meso loop (5-10 minutes):** Investigate location → Find all clues → Form hypothesis

* Self-contained (each location is mini-mystery)
* Clear completion (found all clues = done)
* Progress visible (clue counter, map updates)

**Macro loop (20-30 minutes):** Solve mystery → Reveal new area/information → New mystery emerges

* Total session time (can complete in one sitting)
* Clear ending (mystery solved, satisfaction delivered)
* Hook for return (new mystery available but not required)

**Meta loop (5-10 hours):** Solve all mysteries → Understand overarching story

* Optional (can stop after any macro loop and feel satisfied)
* No time pressure (mysteries don't expire)
* Intrinsic motivation (curiosity about full story)

**Investment Trajectory:** Flat Low

* Micro: Low (examining is simple)
* Meso: Low (deduction is straightforward)
* Macro: Low (mysteries are solvable without complex systems)
* Meta: Low (story complexity is optional)

#### Step 3: Component Requirements

**Mechanics (what you can do):**

**Derived from loop architecture:**

* Micro loops need simple interaction → Click/tap to examine
* Discovery aesthetic needs variety → Each object has unique information
* Casual players need clarity → No hidden mechanics, everything visible

**Implementation Example (Return of the Obra Dinn-style):**

* **Examine:** Click object → Info appears in notebook
* **Notebook:** Organized by topic, filters available, clues cross-referenced
* **Deduction:** Fill in blanks (Who? What? Where? When?)
* **Confirmation:** System confirms correct deductions (positive feedback)
* **No fail states:** Can't "lose" investigation, just haven't solved it yet

**Why these mechanics serve Discovery + Casual:**

* Extremely simple execution (point and click, no timing/skill)
* Information externalized (notebook = no memory required)
* Confirmations prevent frustration (know when you're right)
* No punishment (can't fail, only haven't succeeded yet)

**Parameters (how much, how fast, how scarce):**

**Derived from loop duration:**

* Meso loop = 5-10 minutes → Must be \~10-20 clues per location
* If examining takes 30 seconds per clue: 20 clues × 30s = 10 minutes
* Macro loop = 20-30 minutes → Must be 2-3 locations per mystery

**Derived from Discovery aesthetic:**

* Must provide variety → Each location visually/thematically distinct
* Must provide "aha!" moments → Some clues contradict initial assumptions
* Must enable mastery → Optional hidden clues for thorough explorers

**Derived from Casual capacity:**

* Must not overwhelm → No more than 5-7 active mysteries at once
* Must provide clarity → All necessary clues available (no missables)
* Must respect time → Can save progress anytime

**Implementation Example:**

* **Clues per location:** 15-25 (enough for 10-minute investigation)
* **Locations per mystery:** 2-3 (enough for 20-30 minute solve)
* **Total mysteries:** 8-12 (enough for 5-10 hour game)
* **Deduction difficulty:**
  * 70% clues obvious (accessible to casual)
  * 20% clues require thought (satisfying for engaged players)
  * 10% clues hidden (optional for completionists)
* **Time pressure:** NONE (casual players can't handle urgency)
* **Save system:** Auto-save after each clue found (can quit anytime)

**Why these parameters serve Discovery + Casual:**

* 10-minute investigations match casual session length
* No time pressure respects casual interruptions (phone rings, kid needs help)
* Auto-save means never lose progress
* Most clues accessible means casual players can succeed

**Context (what it means):**

**Derived from Discovery aesthetic:**

* Must create curiosity (what happened here?)
* Must reward attention (environmental storytelling)
* Must make player feel clever (deduction satisfaction)

**Derived from Casual capacity:**

* Should use familiar genre (mystery conventions understood)
* Should have clear visual language (clues obviously interactable)

**Implementation Example:**

* **Setting:** Mystery investigation (murder, conspiracy, historical event)
* **Player role:** Detective/investigator (framing for examination)
* **Tone:** Serious enough to engage, not so dark it's off-putting
* **Visual design:**
  * Interactable objects highlighted (casual players don't want pixel hunting)
  * Notebook always accessible (can review clues anytime)
  * Map shows completed/incomplete areas (progress visible)

**Why this context serves Discovery + Casual:**

* Mystery genre creates intrinsic curiosity (want to know what happened)
* Detective role justifies examination mechanic
* Clear visual language removes guessing (casual players don't want obscurity)
* Progress visibility prevents feeling lost

**Pacing (when things happen):**

**Derived from loop architecture:**

* Micro loops continuous → Constant small discoveries
* Meso loops episodic → Each location self-contained
* Macro loops provide closure → Mystery solved = complete satisfaction
* Meta loops optional → Can stop after any mystery

**Derived from Discovery aesthetic:**

* Must provide steady reveals (not all at end)
* Must create "aha!" moments (when pieces click)
* Must respect player deduction (don't give away answers)

**Derived from Casual capacity:**

* Must allow stopping anytime (save-anywhere)
* Must provide resume help (what was I doing?)
* Must not punish breaks (no time decay)

**Implementation Example:**

* **Clue pacing:**
  * First 5 clues: Establish context (who, where)
  * Next 5-10 clues: Complicate mystery (contradictions, new questions)
  * Final 5 clues: Enable solution (pieces fit together)
* **"Aha!" moments:**
  * Clue #8 contradicts assumption from clue #2 (recontextualization)
  * Final clue reveals what actually happened (satisfaction)
* **Resume helper:**
  * On load: "You were investigating the dining room"
  * Notebook: Shows recent clues, current hypotheses
  * Map: Shows last location visited

**Why this pacing serves Discovery + Casual:**

* Steady reveals maintain engagement (always discovering)
* "Aha!" moments deliver Discovery satisfaction
* Resume helper respects busy lives (can pick up after days away)
* No time pressure means casual can take weeks if needed

#### Step 4: Validate Configuration Coherence

**Mechanics:**

* ✅ Simple point-and-click (casual-accessible)
* ✅ Each interaction reveals information (Discovery)
* ✅ No fail states (casual-friendly)
* **Serves Discovery + Casual: YES**

**Parameters:**

* ✅ 10-minute investigations (casual session length)
* ✅ No time pressure (respects interruptions)
* ✅ Auto-save (never lose progress)
* **Serves Discovery + Casual: YES**

**Context:**

* ✅ Mystery creates curiosity (Discovery)
* ✅ Clear visual language (casual-accessible)
* ✅ Progress visible (prevents feeling lost)
* **Serves Discovery + Casual: YES**

**Pacing:**

* ✅ Episodic meso loops (can stop after each)
* ✅ Steady reveals (Discovery satisfaction)
* ✅ Resume helper (casual-friendly)
* **Serves Discovery + Casual: YES**

**Loop Architecture:**

* ✅ Macro loops 20-30 minutes (casual session)
* ✅ Meso loops 5-10 minutes (progress visible)
* ✅ Meta optional (can stop anytime)
* **Matches casual capacity: YES**

**Configuration Coherence: PASSED**

* Result: This is Return of the Obra Dinn (or similar detective games for casual audiences)

### Worked Example 3: Submission Aesthetic for Busy Adults

#### Step 1: Aesthetic Goal + Player Capacity

**Primary Aesthetic:** Submission (relaxation, turning brain off)
**Secondary Aesthetics:** Sensation (satisfying feedback), Progression (visible growth)
**Target Players:** Busy Adults (20-45 min sessions, unpredictable schedules)

**From Players & Contexts:**

* Time: 20-45 minutes per session, 3-5 sessions per week
* Cognitive capacity: Moderate when fresh, low when tired (variable)
* Investment tolerance: Flat Low (want simple, stay simple)
* Context: Likely playing to unwind after work

#### Step 2: Loop Architecture Requirements

**Derive from Submission aesthetic:**

* Micro loops must be nearly automatic (minimal decisions)
* Meso loops should have brief strategic moments (not stressful)
* Macro loops must have clear endpoints (prevent "one more turn" trap)
* Meta loops should be purely intrinsic (no FOMO)

**Derive from Busy Adult capacity:**

* Macro loops: 20-30 minutes (matches available time)
* Meso loops: 60-90 seconds (brief breaks from flow)
* Micro loops: Continuous (no discrete actions)
* Meta loops: Optional (completable without meta engagement)

**Derived Loop Architecture:**

**Micro loop (continuous):** Move → Auto-attack → Enemies die → XP accumulates

* Zero execution requirement (just movement)
* Constant positive feedback (always killing, always gaining)
* Flow state maintained indefinitely

**Meso loop (60-90 seconds):** Level up → Choose upgrade → Resume flow

* Brief pause (choose without time pressure)
* Immediate payoff (feel more powerful)
* Return to flow (strategic moment over)

**Macro loop (20-30 minutes):** Full run → Death or time cap → Currency earned

* Hard time cap (30 minutes max—prevents binging)
* Always get something (unlock currency)
* Clear endpoint (death/victory both feel complete)

**Meta loop (20-60 hours):** Unlock characters/weapons → Try new builds → Complete achievements

* Pure curiosity (what does this weapon do?)
* No time pressure (unlocks never expire)
* No skill requirement (can complete everything eventually)

**Investment Trajectory:** Flat Low

* Micro: Minimal (just move)
* Meso: Minimal (quick choice)
* Macro: Minimal (no complex strategy needed)
* Meta: Minimal (curiosity-driven)

#### Step 3: Component Requirements

**Mechanics:** Movement only, attacks automatic, upgrades choose-one-of-three
**Parameters:** 30-minute hard cap, level-ups every 60-90s, enemy scaling slower than player
**Context:** Lighthearted gothic horror (threatening but not scary), cartoonish art
**Pacing:** Continuous flow with 90-second strategic pauses, escalates to cathartic slaughter

**Result:** This is Vampire Survivors

(Full derivation similar to Examples 1 and 2—mechanics, parameters, context, pacing all flow from aesthetic + capacity)

## From Architecture to Prototype

You've designed your loop architecture. Now: **what do you build first?**

### The Prototyping Order (Always the Same)

**1. Micro Loop FIRST (80% of playtime happens here)**

**Why first:**

* Most repeated interaction (if micro sucks, game sucks)
* Foundation for everything else (meso/macro/meta built on micro)
* Fastest to test (can prototype in hours/days, not weeks)

**What to build:**

* Core action (attack, jump, examine, move)
* Basic feedback (damage numbers, sound effects, visual response)
* Simplest enemy/obstacle (one type is enough)
* Repeat-loop test (can you do this 100 times without boredom?)

**What to test:**

* **Feel:** Does it feel good? Satisfying feedback? Clear response?
* **Flow:** Can you enter flow state? Does time disappear?
* **Clarity:** Always know what's happening? Feedback immediate?
* **Duration:** How long until boredom? (target: >5 minutes of pure micro loop)

**Success metrics:**

* Playtesters lose track of time (flow achieved)
* Want to keep playing even with no progression (micro loop intrinsically fun)
* Can explain what they're doing without confusion (clarity)

**Iteration:**

* Adjust timing (attack speed, animation length, feedback delay)
* Adjust power (damage numbers, enemy health, player capabilities)
* Adjust juice (visual effects, sound design, screen shake)

**Red flags:**

* Boredom within 2 minutes (micro loop too simple/repetitive)
* Confusion about what happened (feedback unclear)
* Desire to stop (micro loop not intrinsically engaging)

**When to move on:**

* Micro loop can sustain engagement for >5 minutes solo
* Playtesters voluntarily continue playing beyond test period
* Feel, flow, and clarity all validated

**2. Meso Loop Structure (Creates Goals and Progress)**

**Why second:**

* Gives context to micro actions ("I'm working toward checkpoint")
* Creates satisfaction cycle (goal → progress → completion → reward)
* Enables longer play sessions (micro alone exhausts after \~10 minutes)

**What to build:**

* Goal framing (what are you working toward?)
* Progress visibility (how close are you?)
* Completion signal (how do you know you're done?)
* Reward delivery (what do you get?)

**Example: Challenge Game**

* String together 10-15 encounters toward checkpoint
* Show progress: "5/15 enemies defeated" or spatial progress on map
* Completion: Checkpoint reached, bonfire lit, safe room entered
* Reward: Resource refill (health, ammo), save point, level-up currency

**Example: Discovery Game**

* Define investigation area (mansion wing, city district, dungeon level)
* Show progress: "12/18 clues found" or map completion percentage
* Completion: All clues found, hypothesis formed, mystery solved
* Reward: New area unlocked, story revealed, curiosity satisfied

**What to test:**

* **Goal clarity:** Do players always know what they're working toward?
* **Progress satisfaction:** Does it feel good to make progress?
* **Completion ceremony:** Is finishing the meso loop satisfying?
* **Duration:** Does it match target length? (5-30 minutes depending on design)

**Success metrics:**

* Players can state their current goal ("I'm trying to reach the checkpoint")
* Progress feels meaningful (not just numbers incrementing)
* Completion provides satisfaction ("yes, I did it!")
* Duration matches aesthetic/capacity targets

**Red flags:**

* "What am I supposed to be doing?" (goal unclear)
* Progress feels arbitrary (just grinding, no visible advancement)
* Completion anticlimactic (no ceremony, no satisfaction)
* Too short/long for target audience

**When to move on:**

* Meso loop provides clear goals and satisfying completion
* Duration matches target (casual: 5-10 min, midcore: 10-30 min, hardcore: 30-60 min)
* Players naturally want to continue to next meso loop

**3. Macro Loop (Session Closure and Achievement)**

**Why third:**

* Provides session-appropriate endpoint (can stop feeling satisfied)
* Creates major achievement moments (meaningful progression)
* Tests if multiple meso loops build satisfying arc

**What to build:**

* Macro goal (defeat boss, solve mystery, complete run, win match)
* Escalation (difficulty/stakes increase toward climax)
* Climax moment (boss fight, final puzzle, victory condition)
* Closure ceremony (ending screen, rewards, what's next preview)

**Example: Challenge Game (Dark Souls-style)**

* 3-5 meso loops (checkpoints) build toward boss
* Escalation: Enemies get harder, resources scarcer as you approach boss
* Boss fight: 5-10 minutes, ultimate skill test, multiple phases
* Closure: Victory screen, boss soul earned, new area unlocked, bonfire lit

**Example: Discovery Game (Obra Dinn-style)**

* 2-3 meso loops (locations) build toward mystery solution
* Escalation: Clues complicate mystery, contradictions emerge
* Solution moment: All pieces fit, "aha!" realization
* Closure: Mystery complete screen, story revealed, new mystery preview

**What to test:**

* **Arc satisfaction:** Does macro loop feel like complete story arc?
* **Climax appropriateness:** Is final challenge right difficulty/duration?
* **Closure quality:** Does ending feel satisfying? Good stopping point?
* **Duration:** Does it match target session length?

**Success metrics:**

* Macro loop feels like complete experience (beginning, middle, end)
* Climax is memorable high point (talk about this moment)
* Closure provides satisfaction (can stop here feeling good)
* Duration matches capacity (casual: 20-30 min, midcore: 45-90 min, hardcore: 2-6 hours)

**Red flags:**

* No sense of arc (just meso loops strung together without escalation)
* Climax too easy/hard (doesn't match skill developed during macro loop)
* Ending anticlimactic (no closure, no ceremony)
* Wrong duration for audience (too short = shallow, too long = exhausting)

**When to move on:**

* Macro loop provides satisfying complete experience
* Duration appropriate for target audience
* Can stop after macro loop feeling satisfied (good stopping point achieved)

**4. Meta Loop (Long-Term Investment)**

**Why last:**

* Least essential (many great games have minimal meta loops)
* Most complex (tracking across sessions, cloud saves, progression systems)
* Built on foundation (needs working micro/meso/macro first)

**What to build (minimal):**

* Unlock system (new content available after macro loop completion)
* Progression tracking (what have you completed? what's left?)
* Difficulty scaling (optional challenges for mastery players)
* Save/resume system (cloud saves, cross-session state persistence)

**What to build (optional):**

* Achievements/trophies (skill demonstration)
* Leaderboards/rankings (competitive measurement)
* New Game+ (replay with carried-over power)
* Challenge modes (modifiers, restrictions)

**What NOT to build:**

* FOMO mechanics (limited-time content, daily requirements)
* Social obligation systems (guild requirements, scheduled raids)
* Exponential investment escalation (perpetual treadmill)

**What to test:**

* **Return motivation:** Do players want to play another macro loop?
* **Progression satisfaction:** Do unlocks feel meaningful?
* **Optional depth:** Can players ignore meta and still enjoy?
* **Intrinsic vs extrinsic:** Are players returning from curiosity or obligation?

**Success metrics:**

* Players naturally want to play "one more run" (intrinsic motivation)
* Unlocks change experience meaningfully (not just cosmetic)
* Can stop anytime without feeling they're missing out (no FOMO)
* Can return after breaks without falling behind (no catch-up required)

**Red flags:**

* Players feel obligated to play (FOMO, dailies, social pressure)
* Unlocks are just cosmetic (no gameplay impact)
* Can't ignore meta loop (required for basic game access)
* Returning after break punishes (fell behind, can't catch up)

**When it's done:**

* Meta loop provides intrinsic motivation (curiosity, mastery, completion)
* Can engage or ignore based on player preference
* No FOMO, no obligation, no exponential escalation

### Summary: Prototyping Order

```
1. Micro Loop (days to weeks)
   ↓ Test: Feel, flow, clarity
   ↓ Success: Can play for >5 min without boredom
   
2. Meso Loop (weeks)
   ↓ Test: Goals, progress, completion
   ↓ Success: Clear objective, satisfying finish
   
3. Macro Loop (weeks to months)
   ↓ Test: Arc, climax, closure, stopping points
   ↓ Success: Complete experience, session-appropriate
   
4. Meta Loop (months)
   ↓ Test: Return motivation, progression, optional depth
   ↓ Success: Intrinsic motivation, no FOMO
```

**Total development time estimate:**

* Micro: 10-30% of total dev time (but most critical)
* Meso: 20-30% of total dev time
* Macro: 30-40% of total dev time (bosses, content, balance)
* Meta: 10-20% of total dev time (progression systems, cloud saves)

**Common mistake:** Spending equal time on all four scales. Focus on micro—it's 80% of playtime.

## Testing Framework: What to Measure at Each Scale

### Micro Loop Testing

**Quantitative metrics:**

* **Actions per minute:** How many micro loops completed?
* **Error rate:** How often do players fail micro action?
* **Mastery curve:** How quickly does error rate decrease?
* **Time to boredom:** How long until players want to stop?

**Qualitative questions:**

* Can you explain what you're doing? (clarity)
* Does this feel good to do? (satisfaction)
* Would you do this for 5 minutes straight? (engagement)
* Do you feel in control? (agency)

**Red flags:**

* Confusion about what's happening
* Boredom before 2 minutes
* Feeling of randomness (actions don't matter)
* Physical discomfort (RSI, motion sickness)

### Meso Loop Testing

**Quantitative metrics:**

* **Goal completion rate:** What % of players finish meso loops?
* **Time per meso loop:** Does it match target duration?
* **Progress interruptions:** How often do players stop mid-meso?
* **"One more" rate:** Do players continue to next meso loop?

**Qualitative questions:**

* What are you trying to accomplish? (goal clarity)
* Do you feel like you're making progress? (advancement visibility)
* Would you feel okay stopping here? (stopping point quality)
* Do you want to continue? (engagement)

**Red flags:**

* Can't articulate goal ("I don't know what I'm doing")
* Progress feels arbitrary (just grinding)
* Meso loops too long/short for target audience
* Never wanting to continue (meso loop unsatisfying)

### Macro Loop Testing

**Quantitative metrics:**

* **Completion rate:** What % finish macro loops?
* **Session duration:** How long do players play?
* **Return rate:** Do they play another session?
* **Stopping point usage:** Where do players stop?

**Qualitative questions:**

* Did this session feel complete? (closure)
* Was this the right amount of time? (duration appropriateness)
* Would you play again tomorrow? (return motivation)
* Do you feel you accomplished something? (achievement)

**Red flags:**

* Completion rate \<50% (macro loop too long/hard)
* Players stop mid-macro frustrated (no good stopping points)
* Don't want to return (macro loop unsatisfying)
* Session length wildly off target (design vs. reality mismatch)

### Meta Loop Testing

**Quantitative metrics:**

* **Return rate over weeks:** Do players come back?
* **Completion rate:** What % finish all content?
* **Time to completion:** How long does full meta loop take?
* **Churn rate:** When do players stop returning?

**Qualitative questions:**

* Why do you keep playing? (intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation)
* Do you feel obligated to play? (FOMO check)
* Can you stop for a week and return? (flexibility)
* What brings you back? (return drivers)

**Red flags:**

* Obligation language ("I have to play")
* FOMO anxiety ("I'll miss out")
* Can't take breaks (falling behind)
* Returns drop sharply after initial weeks (poor meta loop)

## Summary: Operationalizing Loops

This part provided the operational bridges from temporal architecture to concrete implementation:

**Loop Scale → System Functions**

* Micro loops need instant adjudication and clear feedback
* Meso loops need goal clarity and progress tracking
* Macro loops need state persistence and session resumption
* Meta loops need long-term tracking and replayability

**Loop Duration → Parameter Constraints**

* Hard time caps enable mathematical parameter derivation
* Long macro loops require fast micro loops
* Animation frequency × length = total watching time
* Recovery speed determines pacing pattern

**Aesthetic → Loop → Components**

* Complete worked examples showing full design chain
* Challenge aesthetic → consistent loops → skill-based mechanics
* Discovery aesthetic → variety loops → exploration mechanics
* Submission aesthetic → automatic loops → minimal mechanics

**Architecture → Prototype**

* Build micro loop first (most critical, fastest to test)
* Add meso loop (creates goals and progress)
* Add macro loop (provides closure and achievement)
* Add meta loop last (long-term investment)

**Key Principle:** Every temporal decision constrains your design space. Use these constraints to derive concrete, testable systems.

**Next:** Part 11 provides quick reference checklists for aesthetic-to-loop mapping.

**Confidence Level: HIGH** - System function requirements are logically derived from loop characteristics. Parameter constraints are mathematically demonstrable. Design process validated through worked examples. Prototyping order reflects industry best practices.
