# Loop Design Analysis: Case Studies

## Introduction

This document analyzes loop structures in five games to extract principles for game system design. We examine three successes (Hades, Into the Breach, Subnautica) and two failures (Anthem, early No Man's Sky) to understand what makes loops engaging or broken.

***

## GAME 1: HADES (Success - Action Roguelike)

### 1. Loop Identification

**Micro Loops (5-30 seconds):**

* Name: Combat Encounter
* Actions: Attack → Dodge → Cast → Special → Dash-Strike
* Duration: 5-30 seconds per enemy wave
* Completion Signal: Room clear effect, doors unlock
* Reward: Darkness, coins, gems drop immediately

**Meso Loops (30 seconds - 3 minutes):**

* Name: Room Progression
* Actions: Clear room → Collect rewards → Choose blessing/path → Enter next room
* Duration: 1-3 minutes
* Completion Signal: Reaching chamber reward (boon, hammer, shop)
* Reward: Boons, upgrades, currency, health

**Macro Loops (20-40 minutes):**

* Name: Escape Attempt
* Actions: Fight through Tartarus → Asphodel → Elysium → Temple → Boss
* Duration: 20-40 minutes (depending on skill)
* Completion Signal: Death or successful escape
* Reward: Persistent currencies, story progression, new dialogue

**Meta Loops (Endless):**

* Name: House of Hades Progression
* Actions: Upgrade mirror → Gift characters → Unlock weapons → Advance relationships
* Duration: Ongoing across dozens of runs
* Completion Signal: Individual storylines complete, prophecies fulfilled
* Reward: Permanent power increases, story revelations, new gameplay options

### 2. Loop Relationships

* **Nesting**: Perfect matryoshka - each combat fits in rooms, rooms in biomes, biomes in runs, runs in meta progression
* **Dependencies**: Meta upgrades make runs easier → reach new bosses → unlock new story → unlock new upgrades
* **Feedback**: Death provides currencies for meta → stronger next run → see more content → more currencies
* **Transitions**: Smooth - room clear immediately offers choice, death immediately returns to House

### 3. Pacing Dynamics

* **Tension Curves**: Builds within rooms (enemy waves), across biomes (increasing difficulty), releases at shops/story moments
* **Decision Density**:
  * Micro: 2-3 tactical decisions/second in combat
  * Meso: 1 strategic decision/room (which door?)
  * Macro: 5-6 build decisions/run (which boons to pursue?)
* **Cognitive Load**: Low-moderate, most information visible (enemy telegraphs, health bars)
* **Flow Maintenance**: Constant forward momentum, no dead time

### 4. Progress Signals

* **Immediate**: Damage numbers, enemy stagger, satisfying hit effects
* **Session**: Reaching new biome, beating personal best
* **Permanent**: Mirror upgrades, weapon unlocks, relationship hearts
* **Mastery**: Faster clear times, heat levels, perfect clears

### 5. Failure Integration

* **Micro Failure**: Lost health becomes tension for rest of run
* **Macro Failure**: Death gives currency, story, and knowledge
* **Learning**: Enemy patterns, room layouts, boss mechanics
* **Motivation**: "One more run" - always something new to see/unlock

### 6. Content Relationship

* **Content Per Loop**:
  * Micro: \~50 enemy types, \~100 room layouts
  * Meso: \~200 boon combinations
  * Macro: 6 weapons × 4 aspects × countless builds
  * Meta: \~10,000 lines of contextual dialogue
* **Reuse Patterns**: Remixes same elements in new combinations
* **Procedural vs Authored**: Procedural room selection, authored room designs
* **Depletion**: Virtually impossible - too many combinations

### 7. Aesthetic Alignment

* **Primary Aesthetic**: Challenge (overcoming difficulty)
* **Supporting Aesthetics**: Narrative (story mystery), Expression (build crafting), Discovery (new combinations)
* **Anti-Patterns**: Never grindy, never hopeless
* **Coherence**: Every loop reinforces "one more run" mentality

### 8. Critical Success Factors

* **What Works**: Failure always provides progress; every run feels different; story integration makes repetition meaningful
* **What Breaks**: Nothing significant - near-perfect loop design
* **Missing Links**: None
* **Unnecessary Complexity**: None - remarkably lean design

***

## GAME 2: INTO THE BREACH (Success - Tactical Puzzle)

### 1. Loop Identification

**Micro Loops (10-60 seconds):**

* Name: Turn Evaluation
* Actions: Analyze threats → Plan moves → Preview outcomes → Execute/Undo
* Duration: 10-60 seconds per unit
* Completion Signal: Confirm turn action
* Reward: Prevented damage, enemies destroyed

**Meso Loops (3-8 minutes):**

* Name: Mission Completion
* Actions: Deploy → Complete 3-5 turns → Achieve objectives
* Duration: 5-10 minutes
* Completion Signal: All turns complete or objectives met
* Reward: Stars (perfect completion), reputation, grid power

**Macro Loops (60-90 minutes):**

* Name: Island Liberation Campaign
* Actions: Complete 4 islands → Final missions → Victory/Defeat
* Duration: 60-90 minutes
* Completion Signal: Final mission complete or grid destroyed
* Reward: Coins for unlocks, new pilot saved

**Meta Loops (Ongoing):**

* Name: Squad and Achievement Unlocks
* Actions: Complete achievements → Unlock squads → Master each squad
* Duration: Dozens of runs
* Completion Signal: All squads unlocked, achievements earned
* Reward: New gameplay styles, cosmetics

### 2. Loop Relationships

* **Nesting**: Turns build missions, missions build islands, islands build campaigns
* **Dependencies**: Reputation → upgrades → easier missions → better pilot saves
* **Feedback**: Perfect missions → more resources → stronger squad → tackle harder difficulties
* **Transitions**: Clean mission select screen, clear objective communication

### 3. Pacing Dynamics

* **Tension Curves**: Escalates each turn (more enemies), releases between missions
* **Decision Density**:
  * Micro: 3-5 critical decisions per turn
  * Meso: 2-3 strategic decisions per mission (which objectives to sacrifice?)
* **Cognitive Load**: High during turns (tracking all interactions), low between missions
* **Flow Maintenance**: Perfect information creates pure puzzle flow state

### 4. Progress Signals

* **Immediate**: Preview shows exact outcomes, no uncertainty
* **Session**: Islands completed, grid health maintained
* **Permanent**: New squads, achievements
* **Mastery**: Higher difficulties, perfect runs, squad variety

### 5. Failure Integration

* **Micro Failure**: Can undo turns infinitely (no real micro failure)
* **Macro Failure**: Lost campaign provides experience and sometimes pilot
* **Learning**: Enemy patterns, squad synergies, positioning principles
* **Motivation**: Different squads play completely differently

### 6. Content Relationship

* **Content Per Loop**:
  * Micro: \~50 enemy types, thousands of board states
  * Meso: \~20 mission types, \~50 maps
  * Macro: 8 squads × 5 difficulties
* **Reuse Patterns**: Same missions feel different with different squads
* **Procedural vs Authored**: Procedural enemy placement, authored maps
* **Depletion**: Replayable due to squad variety and randomization

### 7. Aesthetic Alignment

* **Primary Aesthetic**: Mastery (perfect solution exists)
* **Supporting Aesthetics**: Challenge, Discovery (finding optimal moves)
* **Anti-Patterns**: No randomness in outcomes, no grinding
* **Coherence**: Everything serves the puzzle-solving fantasy

### 8. Critical Success Factors

* **What Works**: Perfect information removes frustration; undo system encourages experimentation; each squad is a new game
* **What Breaks**: Can feel samey after many hours
* **Missing Links**: Limited meta progression
* **Unnecessary Complexity**: None - extremely elegant

## GAME 3: ANTHEM (Failure - Looter Shooter)

### 1. Loop Identification

**Micro Loops (Seconds):**

* Name: Combat Engagement
* Actions: Fly → Shoot → Ability → Dodge
* Duration: 10-30 seconds
* Completion Signal: Enemies dead
* Reward: Unclear (loot drops later)

**Meso Loops (Confused):**

* Name: Mission... Something?
* Actions: Fly to objective → Fight waves → Collect things? → Stand on plate?
* Duration: 15-30 minutes
* Completion Signal: Mission complete screen (disconnected from action)
* Reward: Loot explosion (not immediately usable)

**Macro Loops (Broken):**

* Name: Gear Progression?
* Actions: Do missions → Return to Fort → Salvage loot → Equip marginally better items
* Duration: 2-4 hours?
* Completion Signal: Higher gear score number
* Reward: Bigger numbers that don't feel different

**Meta Loops (Missing):**

* Name: ???
* Actions: Grind same content repeatedly?
* Duration: Endless?
* Completion Signal: None
* Reward: Cosmetics? (mostly paid)

### 2. Loop Relationships

* **Nesting**: Loops don't connect - combat doesn't inform loot, loot doesn't change combat
* **Dependencies**: Gear score gates content but doesn't provide power fantasy
* **Feedback**: Weak - higher numbers don't create different gameplay
* **Transitions**: Jarring - loading screens everywhere, Fort Tarsis walking simulator

### 3. Pacing Dynamics

* **Tension Curves**: Random difficulty spikes, no consistent progression
* **Decision Density**:
  * Micro: Good combat decisions
  * Meso: No meaningful decisions (linear missions)
  * Macro: Confusing loot decisions (inscriptions make no sense)
* **Cognitive Load**: Overwhelming loot system, unclear mission objectives
* **Flow Maintenance**: Constantly broken by loading screens and Fort Tarsis

### 4. Progress Signals

* **Immediate**: Combat feels good moment-to-moment
* **Session**: Unclear - did I get stronger?
* **Permanent**: Nothing meaningful
* **Mastery**: Combat has depth but no reason to master it

### 5. Failure Integration

* **Micro Failure**: Respawn (no consequence)
* **Macro Failure**: Mission failure means repeat (pure frustration)
* **Learning**: Nothing to learn - difficulty is gear checks
* **Motivation**: Low - same content with bigger numbers

### 6. Content Relationship

* **Content Per Loop**:
  * Micro: Good enemy variety
  * Meso: \~10 mission types (repetitive)
  * Macro: 3 strongholds
  * Meta: No meaningful content
* **Reuse Patterns**: Exact same missions repeatedly
* **Procedural vs Authored**: All authored, not enough content
* **Depletion**: Runs out immediately

### 7. Aesthetic Alignment

* **Primary Aesthetic**: Supposed to be Power Fantasy
* **Supporting Aesthetics**: Tried for Fellowship (failed)
* **Anti-Patterns**: Grind without purpose
* **Coherence**: Combat promises power, loot system doesn't deliver

### 8. Critical Success Factors

* **What Works**: Core combat feels good, flying is fun
* **What Breaks**: Loot meaningless, no long-term goals, content repetitive
* **Missing Links**: Entire meta game, meaningful progression
* **Unnecessary Complexity**: Convoluted loot system that doesn't affect gameplay

***

## GAME 4: NO MAN'S SKY (Failure at Launch - Space Exploration)

### 1. Loop Identification

**Micro Loops (Seconds):**

* Name: Resource Gathering
* Actions: Scan → Mine → Collect
* Duration: 5-20 seconds
* Completion Signal: Inventory full or resource depleted
* Reward: Resources (for what?)

**Meso Loops (Missing/Unclear):**

* Name: ???
* Actions: Mine → Craft fuel → Fly to next planet → Mine again
* Duration: 10-30 minutes
* Completion Signal: None?
* Reward: Different colored rocks?

**Macro Loops (Vague):**

* Name: Reach the Center
* Actions: Jump between systems hundreds of times
* Duration: 60-100 hours
* Completion Signal: Reaching galactic center
* Reward: Disappointment (literally just restarts)

**Meta Loops (Nonexistent):**

* Name: None
* Actions: N/A
* Duration: N/A
* Completion Signal: N/A
* Reward: N/A

### 2. Loop Relationships

* **Nesting**: Micro actions don't build to anything meaningful
* **Dependencies**: Need resources to travel but travel doesn't provide purpose
* **Feedback**: None - all planets functionally identical
* **Transitions**: Seamless technically, meaningless practically

### 3. Pacing Dynamics

* **Tension Curves**: Flat - no peaks or valleys
* **Decision Density**:
  * Micro: Which rock to mine (doesn't matter)
  * Meso: Which planet to visit (doesn't matter)
  * Macro: Which direction to go (doesn't matter)
* **Cognitive Load**: Low - nothing to track or plan
* **Flow Maintenance**: No flow - just repetitive actions

### 4. Progress Signals

* **Immediate**: Mining laser depletes rocks
* **Session**: Visited X planets (but they're all the same)
* **Permanent**: Ship/tool upgrades (marginal improvements)
* **Mastery**: No skill expression

### 5. Failure Integration

* **Micro Failure**: Run out of life support (annoying)
* **Macro Failure**: Ship destroyed (lose resources)
* **Learning**: Nothing to learn
* **Motivation**: "Maybe next planet will be different" (it won't)

### 6. Content Relationship

* **Content Per Loop**:
  * Micro: 20 resource types
  * Meso: "18 quintillion" planets (all the same)
  * Macro: 1 goal
* **Reuse Patterns**: Procedural generation creates infinite sameness
* **Procedural vs Authored**: All procedural, no authored moments
* **Depletion**: Can't run out but feels repetitive immediately

### 7. Aesthetic Alignment

* **Primary Aesthetic**: Supposed to be Discovery/Wonder
* **Supporting Aesthetics**: Tried for Exploration
* **Anti-Patterns**: Grind without payoff
* **Coherence**: Promises exploration, delivers repetition

### 8. Critical Success Factors

* **What Works**: Initial wonder at scale, seamless planet-to-space
* **What Breaks**: No medium-term goals, no meaningful variation, no purpose
* **Missing Links**: Entire meso loop layer, progression systems, multiplayer
* **Unnecessary Complexity**: Inventory management tedium

## GAME 5: SUBNAUTICA (Success - Survival/Exploration)

### 1. Loop Identification

**Micro Loops (Seconds to Minutes):**

* Name: Gather and Breathe
* Actions: Dive → Gather → Surface for air → Repeat
* Duration: 30-60 seconds (length of breath)
* Completion Signal: Inventory full or need air
* Reward: Resources, discovery of new areas

**Meso Loops (10-30 minutes):**

* Name: Exploration Expedition
* Actions: Prepare supplies → Explore new biome → Gather unique resources → Return to base
* Duration: 15-30 minutes
* Completion Signal: Found new blueprint/resource or supplies exhausted
* Reward: New blueprints, rare resources, story fragments

**Macro Loops (2-5 hours):**

* Name: Technology Tier Progression
* Actions: Gather resources → Craft new tool/vehicle → Access deeper areas → Find new blueprints
* Duration: 2-5 hours per tier
* Completion Signal: Major upgrade complete (Seamoth, Cyclops, PRAWN)
* Reward: Access to previously unreachable areas

**Meta Loops (20-40 hours):**

* Name: Story and Escape
* Actions: Follow signals → Discover story locations → Cure infection → Build rocket
* Duration: Entire playthrough
* Completion Signal: Launch rocket, escape planet
* Reward: Story resolution, sense of mastery over environment

### 2. Loop Relationships

* **Nesting**: Breath limits create micro loops, tools extend exploration range, each tier unlocks deeper mysteries
* **Dependencies**: Need basic resources → craft tools → reach new resources → craft vehicles → reach story locations
* **Feedback**: Each new tool dramatically changes how you interact with the world
* **Transitions**: Natural - running out of supplies forces return, new tools invite exploration

### 3. Pacing Dynamics

* **Tension Curves**:
  * Micro: Air meter creates constant tension/release
  * Meso: Venturing into darkness builds tension, returning to base releases
  * Macro: Each new depth is terrifying then becomes comfortable
* **Decision Density**:
  * Micro: Constant (where to search, when to surface)
  * Meso: Route planning, risk assessment
  * Macro: What to build next, which direction to explore
* **Cognitive Load**: Moderate - tracking oxygen, location, threats
* **Flow Maintenance**: Natural exploration drive, constant "what's over there?"

### 4. Progress Signals

* **Immediate**: New fauna/flora scanned, resources collected
* **Session**: New biome discovered, blueprint found
* **Permanent**: Vehicles built, bases established
* **Mastery**: Navigating without markers, efficient resource runs

### 5. Failure Integration

* **Micro Failure**: Drowning (lose some items, respawn at base)
* **Macro Failure**: Vehicle destroyed (expensive but recoverable)
* **Learning**: Creature behaviors, biome layouts, resource locations
* **Motivation**: Death teaches respect for environment, not frustration

### 6. Content Relationship

* **Content Per Loop**:
  * Micro: \~100 resource types and creatures
  * Meso: \~15 distinct biomes with unique assets
  * Macro: \~50 blueprints in progression chain
  * Meta: Authored story beats and locations
* **Reuse Patterns**: Same biomes feel different as capabilities expand
* **Procedural vs Authored**: Authored world with some procedural resource placement
* **Depletion**: Finite world but dense with content

### 7. Aesthetic Alignment

* **Primary Aesthetic**: Discovery (what's in the deep?)
* **Supporting Aesthetics**: Survival (resource management), Narrative (mystery), Fear (leviathans)
* **Anti-Patterns**: Never grindy, always purposeful
* **Coherence**: Every system reinforces exploration/survival fantasy

### 8. Critical Success Factors

* **What Works**: Perfect gating through equipment; natural curiosity drivers; breath as pacing mechanism; fear as progression gate
* **What Breaks**: Late game can drag without clear objectives
* **Missing Links**: Some players need more guidance
* **Unnecessary Complexity**: Some crafting chains are tedious

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Successful Loop Patterns

1. **Clear Nesting**: Hades, Into the Breach, and Subnautica all have perfectly nested loops where each scale contains and reinforces the others

2. **Failure as Progress**: Hades and Into the Breach make failure provide meta-progression. Subnautica makes failure educational rather than punitive

3. **Natural Pacing**:
   * Hades uses room-to-room structure
   * Into the Breach uses turn-based clarity
   * Subnautica uses oxygen as a natural timer

4. **Meaningful Progression**: Each successful game fundamentally changes how you play as you progress, not just numerical increases

### Failed Loop Patterns

1. **Missing Meso Loops**: Both Anthem and No Man's Sky lack meaningful medium-term goals between minute-to-minute play and ultimate objectives

2. **Disconnected Systems**: Anthem's loot doesn't affect gameplay; No Man's Sky's planets don't provide variety

3. **No Failure Integration**: Both failed games make failure purely frustrating with no learning or progress

4. **Infinite Content, Zero Variety**: No Man's Sky proves that procedural generation without meaningful variation is worse than limited authored content

### Key Design Principles

1. **Every Loop Needs Clear Completion**: Players must know when they've finished a cycle and what they gained

2. **Loops Must Nest Cleanly**: Each scale should contain several iterations of the smaller scale

3. **Progress Must Be Felt, Not Just Shown**: Numbers going up isn't enough - gameplay must evolve

4. **Failure Should Provide Information or Resources**: Never pure setback

5. **Content Needs Meaningful Variety**: Better to have 10 distinct experiences than 10,000 identical ones

6. **Pacing Emerges from Loop Structure**: The time pressure should feel natural to the fiction

7. **Each Loop Scale Needs Its Own Reward**: Immediate, session-based, and permanent rewards serve different psychological needs

***

## DESIGN FRAMEWORK IMPLICATIONS

### For Aesthetic → Loop Mapping

**Discovery Aesthetic** needs:

* Exploration loops with genuine variety
* Gating that creates anticipation
* Reveals that change understanding
* (Subnautica succeeds, No Man's Sky fails)

**Challenge Aesthetic** needs:

* Clear failure/success states
* Skill progression separate from power progression
* Failure that teaches
* (Hades and Into the Breach succeed, Anthem fails)

**Mastery Aesthetic** needs:

* Perfect information or predictable systems
* Multiple solutions to explore
* Depth that reveals over time
* (Into the Breach perfect example)

### For Content Requirements

Successful loops can work with:

* **Limited but Varied**: Into the Breach has maybe 20 mission types but they combine differently
* **Procedural with Authored Moments**: Hades remixes rooms but has fixed bosses
* **Dense Rather Than Vast**: Subnautica's single map beats No Man's Sky's infinity

### For Pacing Design

Natural pacing mechanisms:

* **Resource Depletion**: Subnautica's oxygen
* **Structural Progression**: Hades' biomes
* **Turn-Based Clarity**: Into the Breach's discrete decisions
* **Avoid**: Arbitrary timers, disconnected mission structures

### Critical Questions for Designers

1. Can you diagram your loops at 4 scales? (seconds, minutes, session, meta)
2. Does each loop have a clear completion signal and reward?
3. How does failure at each scale provide value?
4. What naturally drives pacing at each scale?
5. How does progression change the gameplay, not just numbers?
6. Is there enough content variety for each loop scale?
7. Do all loops serve your primary aesthetic goal?

***

## CONCLUSION

Loop design is the temporal architecture of play. Successful games create clear, nested structures where each scale reinforces the others and serves the aesthetic goals. Failed games have missing or disconnected loops that leave players without medium-term goals or meaningful progression.

The framework must help designers:

1. Identify necessary loops for their aesthetic goals
2. Structure loops to create natural pacing
3. Ensure each scale provides appropriate rewards
4. Integrate failure productively
5. Determine content requirements per loop
6. Validate that loops reinforce rather than contradict

The next step is to formalize this into a practical design process that moves from aesthetic goals through loop architecture to specific mechanical implementations.
