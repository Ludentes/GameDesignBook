# Part 4: Loop Architecture Patterns

Now that we understand how different aesthetics require different loop structures, we can examine common architectural patterns. These patterns describe how loop scales combine and nest to create complete temporal experiences. Think of them as templates—starting points you adapt to your specific aesthetic goals and player capacity.

## Pattern 1: Full Stack Architecture

**Definition:** All four loop scales (micro/meso/macro/meta) are present and actively developed.

**When to Use:**

* Multiple aesthetic goals (need different scales for different aesthetics)
* Dedicated player audience (hardcore/midcore with 10+ hours per week)
* Long-term retention important (live service, competitive, campaign)
* Platform supports extended play (PC, console)

**When to Avoid:**

* Casual audience (cognitive budget too limited)
* Mobile/browser context (session length too short)
* Single aesthetic that doesn't need all scales (over-engineering)
* Limited development resources (can't polish all scales)

### Example: Hades

**Micro loops (5-30 seconds):** Combat encounters

* Purpose: Create flow state through responsive combat
* Polish level: Extremely high (combat feels amazing)
* Serves: Challenge aesthetic

**Meso loops (1-3 minutes):** Room progression

* Purpose: Provide structure and choice moments
* Polish level: High (room variety, boon choices meaningful)
* Serves: Discovery (variety) + Mastery (build crafting)

**Macro loops (20-40 minutes):** Escape attempt

* Purpose: Session-appropriate closure
* Polish level: Very high (death feels complete, not frustrating)
* Serves: Progression (always gain something) + Narrative (story advances)

**Meta loops (20-60 hours):** Story and relationships

* Purpose: Long-term investment and return motivation
* Polish level: Exceptional (10,000+ lines of contextual dialogue)
* Serves: Narrative (character arcs) + Collection (unlock everything)

**Why it works:**

* Each scale feeds the next (micro → meso → macro → meta)
* Failure at macro provides progress at meta (death advances story)
* Clear completion signals at each scale
* Rewards appropriate to investment at each level
* All scales serve coherent aesthetic mix (Challenge + Narrative + Progression)

**Key Success Factors:**

* Micro loops must be excellent (most-repeated, foundation of everything)
* Each scale must feel complete (can stop after meso, macro, or meta)
* Failure provides value (not pure setback)
* Investment escalates appropriately (see Part 5)

### Example: Civilization VI

**Micro loops (30-120 seconds):** Turn cycle

* Purpose: Constant decision-making and visible progress
* Serves: Mastery (strategic depth)

**Meso loops (10-30 minutes):** Strategic goal completion (wonder, tech, conquest)

* Purpose: Medium-term objectives
* Serves: Mastery + Discovery (finding optimal strategies)

**Macro loops (4-12 hours):** Full game to victory

* Purpose: Complete strategic arc
* Serves: Mastery (long-term planning) + Progression (civ development)

**Meta loops (hundreds of hours):** Different civs, maps, difficulties

* Purpose: Replayability and mastery depth
* Serves: Mastery (system understanding) + Discovery (strategy variety)

**Why it works (and doesn't):**

* ✅ Serves Mastery aesthetic at all scales
* ✅ Each scale has strategic depth
* ✅ Replayability through variety
* ❌ Macro loops too long (no good stopping points for casual players)
* ❌ "One more turn" problem (weak meso completion signals)
* ⚠️ Works for dedicated strategy players, excludes casual audience

**Lesson:** Full stack works when ALL scales serve aesthetic and match player capacity. Civ's full stack serves Mastery perfectly but requires hardcore time investment.

## Pattern 2: Compressed Architecture

**Definition:** Focus on 1-2 loop scales, minimal or absent complexity at other scales.

**When to Use:**

* Single dominant aesthetic (all effort on one experience)
* Casual audience (limited time, cognitive budget)
* Mobile/browser platform (short sessions, interruption-prone)
* Limited development resources (polish few things well)

**When to Avoid:**

* Multiple aesthetic goals (need different scales)
* Dedicated audience expecting depth (might feel shallow)
* Long-term retention critical without ongoing content (will exhaust quickly)
* Platform supports and expects deeper experiences

### Example: Wordle

**Micro loops:** Essentially absent (single guesses, not repetitive actions)

**Meso loop (3-5 minutes):** THE GAME

* Purpose: Complete daily puzzle
* Polish level: Perfect (word selection carefully curated)
* Serves: Challenge (intellectual satisfaction) + Mastery (optimal guessing strategy)

**Macro loop:** Intentionally broken

* Purpose: Force stopping point
* Design: One puzzle per day (can't binge)
* Serves: Submission (relaxing ritual, no pressure)

**Meta loop:** Minimal (streak tracking, social sharing)

* Purpose: Gentle return motivation
* Design: No FOMO (puzzle always available), no penalties
* Serves: Fellowship (social sharing) + Progression (streak satisfaction)

**Why it works:**

* Meso loop is perfectly tuned (challenging but solvable in 5 minutes)
* Forced stopping respects player time (can't waste hours)
* Social sharing provides return motivation without obligation
* Minimal complexity perfectly matches casual morning ritual

**Key Success Factors:**

* Single loop scale receives ALL polish
* Stopping point is clear and satisfying
* No obligation or FOMO (intrinsic motivation only)
* Perfect for target audience (busy adults wanting 5-minute challenge)

### Example: Vampire Survivors

**Micro loops (continuous):** Movement + auto-attack

* Purpose: Maintain flow state
* Polish level: Perfect (zero friction, constant feedback)
* Serves: Submission (relaxing slaughter) + Sensation (satisfying destruction)

**Meso loops (60-90 seconds):** Level-up choices

* Purpose: Strategic pauses within flow
* Polish level: High (choices meaningful but not stressful)
* Serves: Mastery (build optimization) + Progression (visible power increase)

**Macro loops (15-30 minutes):** Complete run

* Purpose: Session-appropriate closure
* Polish level: Excellent (30-min cap prevents binging, death feels complete)
* Serves: Progression (always unlock something)

**Meta loops (20-60 hours):** Character/weapon unlocks

* Purpose: Return motivation through curiosity
* Polish level: Good (enough variety to stay interesting)
* Serves: Discovery (trying new builds) + Collection (unlock everything)

**Why it works:**

* Compressed into 30-minute sessions (perfect for casual)
* Micro loop has zero friction (pure automation)
* Meso loops punctuate flow without breaking it
* Macro loop forced ending prevents "one more" trap
* Meta loop is intrinsic motivation only (no FOMO)

**Lesson:** Compressed architecture works when you deeply understand your audience and aesthetic. Vampire Survivors perfectly matches Submission aesthetic to casual player capacity.

## Pattern 3: Escalating Complexity Architecture

**Definition:** Start simple (1-2 loop scales), gradually introduce additional scales as players gain mastery.

**When to Use:**

* Complex systems that would overwhelm immediately
* Mixed audience (casual entry, hardcore depth)
* Tutorial/learning curve is critical
* Want broad accessibility without sacrificing depth

**When to Avoid:**

* Aesthetic requires all scales from start (Discovery needs variety immediately)
* Audience expects complexity upfront (hardcore strategy players)
* Can't afford gradual content rollout (limited development budget)

### Example: Slay the Spire (Tutorial → Full Experience)

**Hour 1 (Learning):**

* Micro: Play cards, resolve combat (learn mechanics)
* Meso: Complete floor, choose card reward (learn deck building)
* Macro: Die to boss (learn run structure)
* Meta: Not yet visible

**Investment:** High at micro (learning mechanics), moderate at meso (learning strategy)

**Hour 10 (Competent):**

* Micro: Play cards (now automatic, muscle memory)
* Meso: Optimize deck synergies (strategic depth emerges)
* Macro: Complete runs (victory achievable)
* Meta: Unlocks appear (new cards, relics, character)

**Investment:** Low at micro (mastered), high at meso (optimization), moderate at macro

**Hour 50 (Mastery):**

* Micro: Instant recognition of threats/solutions
* Meso: Complex synergy planning
* Macro: Ascension challenges
* Meta: Mastering all characters, highest ascension levels

**Investment:** Minimal at micro (automatic), high at meso/macro (deep strategy), moderate at meta (working toward completion)

**Why it works:**

* Doesn't overwhelm beginners (start simple)
* Reveals depth gradually (system unfolds)
* Micro investment decreases (mastery develops)
* Meta unlocks provide long-term goals without early pressure

### Example: Monster Hunter Series

**Early Game (First 10 hours):**

* Micro: Learn weapon moveset (single weapon type)
* Meso: Hunt simple monsters (learn loop structure)
* Macro: Progress story (linear missions)
* Meta: Not emphasized yet

**Mid Game (10-50 hours):**

* Micro: Mastered primary weapon, learning second weapon
* Meso: Hunting more complex monsters, learning patterns
* Macro: Crafting gear sets (build crafting emerges)
* Meta: Becoming visible (armor sets, decorations, builds)

**Late Game (50+ hours):**

* Micro: Multiple weapons mastered
* Meso: Challenging hunts require preparation and optimization
* Macro: Build completion (farming for perfect gear)
* Meta: Master all weapons, tackle all challenges

**Why it works:**

* Early simplicity allows learning (not overwhelming)
* Complexity reveals through progression (always something new)
* Each phase feels complete (can stop after story, or continue to endgame)
* Serves different player types (casual finishes story, hardcore masters all weapons)

**Lesson:** Escalating complexity allows broad appeal. Casual players get complete experience without deep systems. Hardcore players get depth if they want it.

## Pattern 4: Parallel Track Architecture

**Definition:** Multiple independent loop structures running simultaneously, serving different aesthetics or player types.

**When to Use:**

* Multiple distinct aesthetics (need different structures for each)
* Mixed player types in same game (casual and hardcore)
* Want players to choose their own engagement level
* Can support multiple progression paths simultaneously

**When to Avoid:**

* Forces players to engage with all tracks (overwhelming)
* Tracks compete for time/attention (creates pressure)
* Can't clearly communicate what each track offers
* Limited development resources (can't polish multiple paths)

### Example: Final Fantasy XIV

**Combat Track (Challenge/Mastery):**

* Micro: Rotation optimization
* Meso: Dungeon/trial completion
* Macro: Raid progression
* Meta: Savage/Ultimate clear, BiS gear

**Story Track (Narrative):**

* Micro: Dialogue, cutscenes
* Meso: Story quest chapters
* Macro: Expansion story arcs
* Meta: Complete all story content

**Crafting/Gathering Track (Progression/Collection):**

* Micro: Gather materials, craft items
* Meso: Level up crafting/gathering jobs
* Macro: Gear progression, specialization
* Meta: Master all jobs, omnicrafter status

**Social Track (Fellowship):**

* Micro: Chat, emotes
* Meso: Group content, FC events
* Macro: Friendships, static groups
* Meta: Community leadership, event organization

**Why it works:**

* Players choose engagement (can do story only, or raids only, or both)
* Tracks don't compete (crafting doesn't require raiding, story doesn't require crafting)
* Different aesthetics served by different tracks
* Can pause one track without falling behind in others

**Why it sometimes fails:**

* FOMO when tracks have time-limited content
* Pressure to engage with all tracks for optimal rewards
* Complexity overwhelming for new players (which track first?)

### Example: Deep Rock Galactic (Simplified Parallel)

**Combat Track:**

* Mission completion, difficulty progression
* Serves: Challenge, Fellowship

**Cosmetic Track:**

* Overclocks, cosmetics, achievements
* Serves: Progression, Collection, Expression

**Tracks are independent:**

* Can engage with combat without caring about cosmetics
* Can collect everything without doing hardest content
* Both tracks provide return motivation
* Neither creates FOMO or obligation

**Why it works:**

* Simple parallel (just 2 tracks, not 10)
* Neither track is required (truly optional)
* Both serve main aesthetics (Challenge + Fellowship)
* No time-limited pressure

**Lesson:** Parallel tracks work when they're optional, don't compete for time, and clearly serve different player motivations.

## Cognitive Load Across Scales

Loop architecture directly impacts cognitive load. More loop scales = more things to track simultaneously.

### Load Accumulation

**Micro loop load:** What am I doing right now? (immediate decisions)
**Meso loop load:** What am I working toward? (medium-term goals)
**Macro loop load:** How do I win this session? (strategic planning)
**Meta loop load:** Why do I keep playing? (long-term context)

**Total cognitive load = sum of all active loops**

**Example: Low-Load Game (Vampire Survivors)**

* Micro: Move (1 decision: where to go)
* Meso: Choose upgrade (1 decision every 60s: which power)
* Macro: Complete run (0 ongoing decisions: automatic)
* Meta: Try new build next time (0 in-session load)
* **Total active load: 2 decisions**

**Example: High-Load Game (Civilization VI)**

* Micro: City management (5-10 decisions per city × multiple cities)
* Meso: Strategic goals (3-5 concurrent goals: wonder, tech, war, diplomacy)
* Macro: Victory path (1 major strategic decision informing all choices)
* Meta: Optimal strategy development (0 in-session but informs decisions)
* **Total active load: 15-30+ decisions being tracked**

### Matching Load to Audience

**Casual players (limited cognitive budget):**

* Can handle 1-2 active loop scales (micro + meso)
* Prefer compressed architecture (Wordle, Vampire Survivors)
* Micro loop should reduce load through mastery
* Meta loop should be optional/minimal

**Midcore players (moderate cognitive budget):**

* Can handle 2-3 active loop scales (micro + meso + macro)
* Prefer escalating complexity (Slay the Spire)
* Micro loop mastery frees attention for strategic thinking
* Meta loop provides goals without obligation

**Hardcore players (high cognitive budget):**

* Can handle 3-4 active loop scales (all of them)
* Prefer full stack or parallel tracks (Civilization, FFXIV)
* Enjoy complexity at all scales
* Meta loop depth is expected and desired

**Design Principle:** Your loop architecture must match your audience's cognitive capacity. Over-engineering (too many scales) overwhelms casual players. Under-engineering (too few scales) bores hardcore players.

**For detailed cognitive load analysis, see Chapter 3: Cognitive Load Management.**

## Choosing Your Architecture

Use this decision framework:

### Step 1: Identify Primary Aesthetic(s)

* Single aesthetic? → Compressed or Escalating
* Multiple aesthetics? → Full Stack or Parallel Tracks
* Reference Part 3 for aesthetic requirements

### Step 2: Identify Target Player Capacity

* Casual (5-30 min sessions)? → Compressed
* Midcore (30-90 min sessions)? → Escalating or Moderate Full Stack
* Hardcore (2+ hours sessions)? → Full Stack or Parallel Tracks
* Reference Chapter 1: Players & Contexts

### Step 3: Match Architecture to Goals + Capacity

**Casual + Single Aesthetic:**

* **Use:** Compressed Architecture
* **Examples:** Wordle, Vampire Survivors, mobile puzzle games
* **Key:** 1-2 loop scales, perfect polish on core loop

**Midcore + Single Aesthetic:**

* **Use:** Escalating Complexity
* **Examples:** Slay the Spire, Hades, roguelikes
* **Key:** Start simple, reveal depth, clear stopping points

**Midcore + Multiple Aesthetics:**

* **Use:** Moderate Full Stack
* **Examples:** Hades (3-4 aesthetics), action RPGs
* **Key:** All scales present but not overwhelming

**Hardcore + Multiple Aesthetics:**

* **Use:** Full Stack or Parallel Tracks
* **Examples:** Civilization, MMORPGs, 4X strategy
* **Key:** Deep systems at all scales OR choose-your-own-depth

### Step 4: Validate Against Constraints

**Questions to ask:**

* Can I polish all chosen loop scales? (resource check)
* Does this match platform context? (mobile vs console)
* Are stopping points clear and appropriate? (session length)
* Does cognitive load match audience capacity? (overwhelm check)
* Do all scales serve aesthetic goals? (coherence check)

## Red Flags by Pattern

### Full Stack Red Flags:

* ❌ Casual audience (cognitive overload)
* ❌ Mobile platform (session length mismatch)
* ❌ Limited resources (can't polish all scales)
* ❌ Micro loops aren't excellent (foundation broken)
* ❌ No clear stopping points (respect for time)

### Compressed Red Flags:

* ❌ Hardcore audience expecting depth (feels shallow)
* ❌ Multiple aesthetics (need more scales to serve them)
* ❌ Long-term retention without content (exhausts quickly)
* ❌ Single loop scale poorly polished (nothing else to fall back on)

### Escalating Complexity Red Flags:

* ❌ Aesthetic requires complexity from start (Discovery needs variety early)
* ❌ Tutorial too long (players bounce before depth)
* ❌ Early game doesn't stand on its own (feels incomplete until hour 10)
* ❌ Can't gracefully introduce new scales (jarring transitions)

### Parallel Tracks Red Flags:

* ❌ Tracks compete for time (creates pressure)
* ❌ One track mandatory for others (not truly parallel)
* ❌ Can't clearly communicate tracks (confusing)
* ❌ FOMO across multiple tracks (overwhelming obligation)
