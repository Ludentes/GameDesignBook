# Part 11: Quick Reference - Aesthetic to Loop Checklist

This section provides quick-reference checklists for designing temporal architecture based on aesthetic goals. Use these as starting points, not rigid prescriptions. Your specific design context (target audience, platform, genre) will require adaptations.

## How to Use These Checklists

**For each aesthetic:**

1. **Loop Requirements:** What temporal structures does this aesthetic need?
2. **Investment Pattern:** How should cognitive/time investment change across scales?
3. **Stopping Points:** Where should players be able to stop satisfyingly?
4. **Return Mechanics:** What brings players back (intrinsic only)?
5. **Red Flags:** What temporal patterns break this aesthetic?

**Process:**

1. Identify your primary aesthetic
2. Review checklist for that aesthetic
3. Check your loop architecture against requirements
4. Validate stopping points match player capacity
5. Ensure return mechanics are intrinsic

## Discovery Aesthetic

**Core Experience:** Exploration, finding new things, understanding systems, revealing secrets

### Loop Requirements

**Micro loops (30-60 seconds):**

* ☐ Variety at each iteration (no two micro actions identical)
* ☐ Information reveals (each action teaches something)
* ☐ Clear feedback (immediately see what you learned)
* ☐ No punishment for exploration (safe to try things)

**Meso loops (5-30 minutes):**

* ☐ Exploration rewards (finding things feels good)
* ☐ Gating that creates anticipation (visible locked content)
* ☐ Recontextualization (new info changes earlier understanding)
* ☐ Self-contained discoveries (can explore area and feel satisfied)

**Macro loops (1-4 hours):**

* ☐ Secrets that gate progression (optional but rewarding)
* ☐ "Aha!" moments (pieces click together)
* ☐ Major capability unlocks (movement, access, understanding)
* ☐ World/knowledge expansion (opens new areas or concepts)

**Meta loops (10-40 hours):**

* ☐ Meta knowledge changes approach (knowing X makes Y different)
* ☐ Optional completion (100% is for dedicated explorers)
* ☐ Replayability through different paths (new discoveries each time)
* ☐ No missable content (can't permanently lock out discoveries)

### Investment Pattern

**Trajectory:** Flat Low to Learning Curve (depending on complexity)

* **Micro:** Low (exploration should be simple)
* **Meso:** Moderate (piecing together info requires thought)
* **Macro:** Moderate (understanding systems/mysteries)
* **Meta:** Low (optional depth for dedicated players)

### Stopping Points

**Frequency:** Every 20-30 minutes (after discovery milestones)

* ☐ Area complete (explored thoroughly)
* ☐ Mystery solved (question answered)
* ☐ Major discovery made (new capability/understanding)
* ☐ Can resume easily (clear map/objective markers)

### Return Mechanics (Intrinsic Only)

* ✓ **Curiosity about unlocked content** (what's in that locked area?)
* ✓ **Unfinished mysteries** (still have questions)
* ✓ **New capabilities to test** (want to see what new tool does)
* ✓ **Environmental intrigue** (world is interesting to explore)
* ✗ **No time-gated discoveries** (no "explore today or miss forever")
* ✗ **No FOMO** (all content always accessible)

### Red Flags

* ❌ Repetitive micro loops (kills Discovery—need variety)
* ❌ Linear progression with no secrets (kills exploration drive)
* ❌ Missable content without warning (creates anxiety, not curiosity)
* ❌ Time pressure (Discovery needs time to explore)
* ❌ Punishment for exploration (damages, costs resources)

### Example Games

* **Outer Wilds:** Pure Discovery, 22-minute loops force new approaches
* **Hollow Knight:** Exploration rewards, equipment gates, backtracking reveals
* **Return of the Obra Dinn:** Information discovery, deduction satisfaction

## Challenge Aesthetic

**Core Experience:** Overcoming difficulty through skill development, earning victory through mastery

### Loop Requirements

**Micro loops (30-90 seconds):**

* ☐ Clear failure/success states (hit or miss, no ambiguity)
* ☐ Consistent patterns (same input → same output, learnable)
* ☐ Skill-based execution (timing, precision, pattern recognition)
* ☐ Immediate feedback on mistakes (know what went wrong)

**Meso loops (10-30 minutes):**

* ☐ Skill tests with escalation (gets harder as you progress)
* ☐ Checkpoints as earned relief (reached through skill)
* ☐ Resource attrition (consequences accumulate)
* ☐ Clear victory conditions (know when section is complete)

**Macro loops (30-120 minutes):**

* ☐ Difficulty progression (challenges build on earlier lessons)
* ☐ Major skill gates (bosses, difficult sections)
* ☐ Earned achievement (victory requires mastery)
* ☐ Meaningful completion (major milestone reached)

**Meta loops (20-100 hours):**

* ☐ Mastery recognition (achievements, rankings, community respect)
* ☐ Optional harder challenges (New Game+, hard mode, speedruns)
* ☐ Skill demonstration opportunities (ways to show expertise)
* ☐ No required grinding (victory through skill, not time)

### Investment Pattern

**Trajectory:** Learning Curve (high initial, low through mastery)

* **Micro:** HIGH initially (learning controls, patterns) → LOW through mastery (muscle memory)
* **Meso:** Moderate consistent (tactical decisions)
* **Macro:** Moderate consistent (strategic planning)
* **Meta:** Low (optional depth for mastery demonstration)

**Critical:** Micro investment MUST decrease with mastery (enables flow state)

### Stopping Points

**Frequency:** Every 30-60 minutes (after earned achievements)

* ☐ Checkpoint/bonfire reached (earned through skill)
* ☐ Boss defeated (major victory)
* ☐ Difficult section complete (sense of accomplishment)
* ☐ Can resume at checkpoint (don't lose progress)

### Return Mechanics (Intrinsic Only)

* ✓ **Boss revenge** (want to defeat challenge that beat you)
* ✓ **Skill improvement satisfaction** (getting better feels good)
* ✓ **Mastery drive** (want to perfect execution)
* ✓ **Challenge variety** (new bosses, new challenges)
* ✗ **No power treadmill** (victory through skill, not grinding)
* ✗ **No required grinding** (don't force time investment)

### Red Flags

* ❌ Random difficulty spikes (prevents pattern learning)
* ❌ Victory through luck not skill (feels unearned)
* ❌ Required grinding to progress (makes skill irrelevant)
* ❌ Micro investment never decreases (prevents flow state)
* ❌ Unclear failure causes (can't learn from mistakes)

### Example Games

***

## Multi-Aesthetic Games

Many games combine multiple aesthetics. When designing for multiple aesthetics:

### Prioritization

**Identify primary aesthetic:**

* This aesthetic wins conflicts
* Determines core loop structure
* Shapes overall feel

**Support secondary aesthetics:**

* Must not contradict primary
* Add depth without confusion
* Optional engagement possible

### Example: Hades

**Primary:** Challenge (core combat)

* Micro loops: Skill-based combat
* Meso loops: Room difficulty progression
* Investment: Learning Curve at micro scale

**Secondary:** Progression (meta unlocks)

* Permanent upgrades help but don't trivialize
* Always advancing something
* Rewards investment over time

**Secondary:** Narrative (relationship progression)

* Story advances through death (aligns with Challenge failure)
* Optional engagement (can skip dialogue)
* Adds depth without complexity

**Why it works:** All aesthetics align. Death serves all three (Challenge test, Progression currency, Narrative advancement). No contradictions.

### Red Flags for Multi-Aesthetic

* ❌ Aesthetics contradict (Challenge needs failure, Submission needs success)
* ❌ Too many aesthetics (confusing, unfocused)
* ❌ Secondary aesthetic becomes mandatory (breaks optional nature)
* ❌ Investment patterns conflict (Submission needs low, Mastery needs high)
