# Chapter 1: Understanding Game Systems

Imagine three musicians at identical pianos.  
One plays bright jazz, one performs a rigid étude, one creates drifting ambient chords.  
Same instrument—three completely different experiences.

Game mechanics work the same way. Dice, cards, physics interactions—these are just instruments. What players feel comes not from the mechanics themselves but from **how they’re arranged, paced, constrained, and framed**. The keys don’t determine the music; the composition does.

You can see this everywhere in game design. _Breath of the Wild_ and _Getting Over It_, for example, both rely on physics-driven interactions—momentum, friction, timing. Same underlying substrate. Yet one produces playful curiosity and joyful experimentation, while the other cultivates tension, frustration, and a very deliberate sense of struggle. Same instrument, different music.

This contrast becomes even sharper when a single studio reuses the same mechanics intentionally. Weatherfactory’s _Cultist Simulator_ and _Book of Hours_ are built from nearly identical parts: cards, verbs, timers. Yet _Cultist Simulator_ is frantic and perilous, while _Book of Hours_ is calm and meditative. Nothing about the core mechanics changed; what changed was the **system**—the configuration of stakes, pacing, constraints, and rewards that shapes the player’s experience.

And that is the point:  
**mechanics are ingredients, but systems are the recipes that produce reliable emotional outcomes.**

This book begins here, with the idea that game systems are not the rules themselves but the _experiential scaffolds_ built from them—the structures designers create so players can have specific kinds of experiences, consistently, through interaction.

## Section 1: The Experiential Scaffold Framework

### What Is a Game System?

A game system is not simply "the rules." It's not a resolution mechanic (roll d20, draw cards, click buttons). It's not a collection of subsystems bolted together hoping they work.

**A game system is a purpose-built experiential scaffold**—a temporary structure that enables players to have experiences they couldn't otherwise access. Like construction scaffolding that lets workers reach heights they couldn't naturally achieve, game systems let players experience being heroes, villains, detectives, or even alien minds.

The scaffold metaphor is deliberate. Scaffolding:

* Has a specific purpose (reach this height, paint that wall)
* Is temporary (removed when the work is done)
* Isn't the point (the building matters, not the scaffold)
* Must be stable enough to support the work
* Can be constructed many ways for the same purpose

Similarly, game systems:

* Have experiential purposes (feel clever, feel powerful, feel scared)
* Exist during play (disappear when you stop playing)
* Aren't the point (the experience matters, not the system)
* Must be coherent enough to support the experience
* Can be designed many ways for the same aesthetic

### Purpose-First Design

Traditional game design often starts with mechanics. "What if we used cards instead of dice?" "What if players bid for actions?" "What if time moved backward?" These can lead to interesting games, but they're solving from the wrong end.

**Purpose-first design inverts this process**. Start with the experience you want players to have, then design backward to the system that creates it. This is the reversal at the heart of the MDA framework (Hunicke, LeBlanc, Zubek, 2004):

* **Players experience**: Aesthetics → Dynamics → Mechanics (working inward)
* **Designers create**: Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics (working outward)
* **But designers should START with**: Aesthetics (what experience?) → then design mechanics to achieve it

Consider **Dread** (Horror RPG, 2005, Tabletop). The designers didn't start with "let's use a Jenga tower." They started with wanting players to feel mounting tension and inevitable collapse. The Jenga tower emerged as the perfect mechanic for that experience: every action literally makes the next action harder, collapse is inevitable but unpredictable, and the physical act of pulling blocks creates actual tension in players' bodies.

### Why This Matters for Designers

**Configuration coherence** becomes testable. If your purpose is Challenge (overcoming difficulty through skill), then every component should serve that purpose:

* Mechanics that reward pattern recognition
* Parameters that make failure costly but fair
* Context that frames struggle as heroic
* Pacing that allows learning from failure

If any component contradicts the purpose—mechanics that randomize success, parameters that trivialize failure, context that makes struggle seem pointless—the scaffold becomes unstable. Players feel the incoherence even if they can't articulate it.

**Trade-offs become explicit**. You can't maximize all aesthetics simultaneously. A game optimized for Fellowship (social interaction) needs different cognitive load than one optimized for Challenge (skill development). Understanding your primary purpose lets you make consistent decisions when aesthetics conflict.

**Validation becomes possible**. "Is this game good?" is unanswerable. "Does this scaffold successfully create the intended experience?" is testable. You can observe whether players feel clever in your mystery game, whether they feel powerful in your power fantasy, whether they feel connected in your social game.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - This framework is validated across thousands of games and decades of design practice.

## Section 2: The Twelve Aesthetics

### Understanding Aesthetics

The MDA framework introduced aesthetics as "the desirable emotional responses evoked in the player." These aren't genres (fantasy, sci-fi) or mechanics (turn-based, real-time). They're the fundamental experiences players seek from games.

Think of aesthetics as the answer to "Why do people play this?" Not "to roll dice" or "to manage resources" but "to feel clever" or "to overcome challenges" or "to express creativity."

### The Core Eight (MDA Framework)

The original MDA framework identified eight fundamental aesthetics:

1. **Sensation** - Game as sense-pleasure. Beautiful art, satisfying sound effects, visceral feedback. **Journey** (2012) creates sensation through stunning visuals and soaring music. **Beat Saber** (2018) synchronizes music with physical motion.

2. **Fantasy** - Game as make-believe. Being someone else, somewhere else. **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** (2011) lets you be the Dragonborn. **Animal Crossing** (2020) lets you build an island paradise.

3. **Narrative** - Game as drama. Stories that unfold, characters that grow, plots that resolve. **The Last of Us** (2013) tells a father-daughter story through gameplay. **Disco Elysium** (2019) makes every dialogue choice shape your character's story.

4. **Challenge** - Game as obstacle course. Difficulties to overcome through skill and persistence. **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** (2019) demands perfect timing and pattern recognition. **Celeste** (2018) requires precise platforming but encourages persistence.

5. **Fellowship** - Game as social framework. Playing together, bonding through shared experience. **Among Us** (2020) creates social deduction and accusation. **It Takes Two** (2021) requires genuine cooperation to progress.

6. **Discovery** - Game as uncharted territory. Finding new things, uncovering secrets. **Outer Wilds** (2019) hides an entire solar system of mysteries. **Breath of the Wild** (2017) rewards exploration in every direction.

7. **Expression** - Game as self-discovery. Creating something uniquely yours. **Minecraft** (2011) provides blocks to build anything imaginable. **The Sims** (2000) lets you create and control virtual lives.

8. **Submission** - Game as pastime. Relaxing, turning your brain off, entering flow state. **Stardew Valley** (2016) offers gentle farming rhythms. **Tetris** (1984) creates a trance-like flow state.

### Our Four Expansions

Through analyzing modern games, we've identified four additional aesthetics that warrant separate classification:

9. **Mastery** - Game as system to deeply understand. Not just overcoming challenges but comprehending underlying systems. **Europa Universalis IV** (2013) rewards deep understanding of interconnected systems. **Street Fighter** (1987-present) has infinite depth in its fighting system. Distinct from Challenge: Challenge is about overcoming, Mastery is about understanding.

10. **Tension** - Game as adrenaline generator. Time pressure, high stakes, constant danger. **XCOM 2** (2016) puts every decision under time pressure. **Phasmophobia** (2020) creates tension through vulnerability. Distinct from Sensation: Sensation is sensory pleasure, Tension is psychological pressure.

11. **Progression** - Game as growth engine. Becoming stronger, unlocking new abilities, watching numbers increase. **Diablo** (1996-present) perfected the loot-and-level loop. **Cookie Clicker** (2013) distills progression to its essence. Distinct from Expression: Expression is creativity, Progression is advancement.

12. **Collection** - Game as accumulation. Gathering sets, completing catalogs, catching them all. **Pokémon** (1996-present) built an empire on collection. **Hades** (2020) uses collection to motivate repeated runs. Distinct from Discovery: Discovery is finding, Collection is possessing.

### Working with Aesthetics

**Primary vs. Secondary**. Most games serve multiple aesthetics, but one should dominate. **Dark Souls** (2011) primarily serves Challenge, with secondary Mastery and Discovery. When aesthetics conflict, the primary aesthetic wins. If Discovery would make Challenge trivial (finding an instant-win button), Challenge wins—no instant-win buttons exist.

**Aesthetic Coherence**. Every component should serve your primary aesthetic. **Papers, Please** (2013) creates Challenge through increasingly complex border inspection rules. The mechanics (checking documents), parameters (time pressure), context (authoritarian bureaucracy), and pacing (escalating complexity) all serve Challenge. Nothing is wasted.

**Player Expectations**. Players come to games seeking specific aesthetics. Someone playing **Dark Souls** expects Challenge—making it easier would break the promise. Someone playing **Animal Crossing** expects Submission and Expression—adding time pressure would violate the contract. Know what aesthetic promise you're making.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH for the original eight (validated by MDA framework research), MEDIUM for our four expansions (validated through our analysis but need broader testing).

## Section 3: The Five Components

Every game system, from the simplest card game to the most complex simulation, consists of five interlocking components. Change any one, and you change the experience. Understanding these components provides a practical framework for both analyzing existing systems and designing new ones.

### Component 1: Mechanics (What You Can Do)

Mechanics are the verbs of your game—the actions players can take and how the system resolves them. These include resolution systems (dice, cards, algorithms), action spaces (what choices exist), and resource interactions (what you can spend, trade, or transform).

**Resolution Systems** determine outcomes. **D\&D** uses d20 + modifier vs. difficulty class—transparent and swingy. **Powered by the Apocalypse** uses 2d6 + stat with three outcome tiers (10+ success, 7-9 mixed, 6- complication)—predictable bell curve with guaranteed forward movement. **Into the Breach** (2018) uses perfect information—no randomness, pure tactical calculation.

**Action Spaces** define possibilities. In **Chess**, you can only move pieces according to fixed patterns. In **Divinity: Original Sin 2** (2017), you can attack, cast spells, use items, manipulate environment, combine elements, talk, sneak, teleport—vast possibility space. In **Wordle** (2022), you can only guess five-letter words—extremely constrained but perfectly suited to its purpose.

The best mechanics fade into the background. Players think about what they want to do, not how the system works. **Advantage/disadvantage in D\&D 5e** replaced complex modifier stacking—roll twice, take the better/worse result. Simple, intuitive, faster than adding numbers.

### Component 2: Parameters (How Much, How Fast, How Scarce)

Parameters are the numbers and constraints that determine feel. Same mechanics with different parameters create completely different experiences. This is Weather Factory's secret—identical card-and-timer mechanics become frantic horror or meditative exploration through parameter changes.

**Scarcity** shapes decisions. In **XCOM 2**, soldiers are precious—losing one hurts. In **Total War**, soldiers are expendable—thousands die per battle. In **Fire Emblem**, fallen units stay dead (permanent loss). In **Advance Wars**, units are completely replaceable (currency loss). Same mechanic (unit combat), different scarcity, different experience.

**Speed** creates pressure. **StarCraft** (1998) measures actions-per-minute—speed is skill. **Civilization VI** (2016) has no time pressure—contemplation is encouraged. **FTL: Faster Than Light** (2012) lets you pause anytime—tactical planning under narrative pressure.

**Recovery** determines pacing. **Modern shooters** regenerate health in seconds—aggressive play rewarded. **Classic Resident Evil** requires finding herbs—conservative play rewarded. **Darkest Dungeon** (2016) makes stress persist between missions—consequences accumulate. **Hades** (2020) fully resets each run—failure is temporary.

Parameters do heavy lifting without adding complexity. You don't need new mechanics for horror—just make resources scarce, recovery slow, and threats lethal.

### Component 3: Context (What It Means)

Context transforms abstract mechanics into meaningful experiences. Rolling dice becomes sword fighting, card play becomes occult research, moving tokens becomes commanding armies. Context isn't just aesthetic window dressing—it fundamentally shapes how players approach the game.

**Setting** provides fictional framework. **Pandemic** (2008) and **Forbidden Island** (2010) have nearly identical mechanics—collect sets of cards to remove threats from a map. But Pandemic feels urgent (diseases spreading) while Forbidden Island feels adventurous (treasure hunting). The mechanics didn't change—the meaning did.

**Tone** affects decision-making. **This War of Mine** (2014) and **Fallout Shelter** (2015) both involve post-apocalyptic resource management. But This War of Mine's serious tone makes stealing medicine from elderly couples feel weighty, while Fallout Shelter's cartoonish tone makes sending dwellers to their doom feel lighthearted.

**Victory Conditions** define purpose. In **Twilight Imperium** (2017), victory comes from completing objectives—encouraging diverse strategies. In **Risk**, victory requires total domination—encouraging aggression. In **Spirit Island** (2017), victory means driving out invaders—encouraging defensive play.

Context must align with mechanics. **Call of Cthulhu** investigators who solve problems by punching monsters breaks the horror context. The mechanics (fragile investigators, sanity loss, overwhelming enemies) reinforce the context (cosmic horror, human insignificance).

### Component 4: Pacing (When Things Happen)

Pacing is the rhythm of experience—when tension builds, when relief comes, when resources refresh, when challenges escalate. Good pacing keeps players engaged. Bad pacing causes boredom or exhaustion.

**Session Arc** shapes individual play experiences. **Powered by the Apocalypse games** structure sessions like TV episodes—establish situation, escalate complications, reach climax, provide resolution. **Legacy games** like **Pandemic Legacy** (2015) end sessions on cliffhangers—driving continued play.

**Progression Arc** shapes long-term engagement. **Monster Hunter** (2004-present) follows a loop: hunt monster → craft gear from parts → hunt stronger monster. Each hunt is complete, but progression continues. **Slay the Spire** (2019) resets after each run but unlocks new cards and relics—temporary failure, permanent discovery.

**Mechanical Pacing** emerges from systems. In **Magic: The Gathering** (1993-present), the mana system naturally paces games—early turns have few options, late turns have many. In **Wingspan** (2019), engine-building creates acceleration—early turns are slow, late turns cascade with bonuses.

Pacing isn't a separate system—it emerges from how other components interact. Fast recovery + low scarcity = aggressive pacing. Slow recovery + high scarcity = cautious pacing. The designer controls pacing through parameter tuning, not additional mechanics.

### Component 5: Configuration (How It All Combines)

Configuration is how components work together. Coherent configuration makes systems feel purposeful. Incoherent configuration makes them feel arbitrary. This is where many games fail—individually good components that don't serve the same purpose.

**Configuration Coherence Test**: For each component, ask "Does this serve my primary aesthetic?" If the answer is no, you have configuration incoherence.

**D\&D for mystery investigation** fails this test:

* Mechanics (combat-focused) - Serves Challenge, not Discovery
* Parameters (resource attrition) - Serves Challenge, not Discovery
* Context (heroic fantasy) - Could serve Discovery
* Pacing (encounter-based) - Serves Challenge, not Discovery
  Result: Players solve mysteries by beating up suspects

**Gumshoe for mystery investigation** passes this test:

* Mechanics (automatic clue discovery) - Serves Discovery
* Parameters (point pools for bonuses) - Serves Discovery
* Context (detective fiction) - Serves Discovery
* Pacing (scene-based investigation) - Serves Discovery
  Result: Players solve mysteries by investigating

Configuration coherence doesn't mean everything must be identical—it means everything must pull in the same direction. **Return of the Obra Dinn** (2018) uses wildly different components (3D exploration, deduction interface, time-freeze mechanic) but they all serve Discovery aesthetic.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Five component analysis validated across hundreds of games.

## Section 4: Core Loops & Flow

### Understanding Core Loops

Core loops are the fundamental cycles of action and feedback that players repeat throughout play. They're the moment-to-moment experience that keeps players engaged. Every game has at least one core loop, and understanding loops helps you shape player experience at the most granular level.

### The Three Nested Loops

Games typically feature three nested loops operating at different timescales:

**Micro Loop** (seconds to minutes) - The immediate action-feedback cycle:

* **Tetris**: See piece → rotate/position → place → clear lines → see next piece
* **DOOM**: See demon → aim → shoot → demon dies → find next demon
* **Wordle**: Think word → type guess → see colored feedback → think new word

The micro loop creates flow state. When it's smooth, players lose track of time. When it's rough, every moment feels laborious.

**Core Loop** (minutes to hours) - The primary gameplay cycle:

* **Monster Hunter**: Accept quest → prepare loadout → hunt monster → carve materials → craft upgrades → accept harder quest
* **Civilization**: Explore map → found cities → build improvements → research technology → expand territory → encounter rivals → resolve conflicts → explore further
* **Slay the Spire**: Enter encounter → play cards → resolve combat → choose reward → modify deck → enter next encounter

The core loop defines what the game "is about." Ask someone what they do in a game, and they'll usually describe the core loop.

**Meta Loop** (hours to campaigns) - The long-term progression cycle:

* **Dark Souls**: Explore area → die to boss → learn patterns → defeat boss → unlock new area → face harder boss
* **Pokémon**: Catch pokémon → train team → defeat gym → earn badge → access new area → catch stronger pokémon
* **XCOM 2**: Complete mission → earn resources → research technology → upgrade soldiers → unlock harder missions → advance story

The meta loop provides purpose and progression. It's why players return session after session.

### How Loops Create Flow

**Flow state** (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) occurs when challenge perfectly matches skill. Too easy leads to boredom. Too hard leads to frustration. The sweet spot creates total absorption.

Core loops create flow through:

**Clear Objectives** - Players always know what to do next. In **Hades**, you always know your goal: reach the next chamber, defeat enemies, choose reward, repeat.

**Immediate Feedback** - Actions have instant, clear results. In **Super Meat Boy** (2010), you instantly know if a jump succeeded or failed. No ambiguity.

**Balance of Challenge and Skill** - Difficulty matches player ability. **Rocket League** (2015) matches you against similar skill levels. As you improve, opponents improve.

**Sense of Control** - Players feel their actions matter. In **Into the Breach**, perfect information means failure is your fault, success is your achievement.

Different aesthetics require different flow profiles:

**Challenge** aesthetic needs high challenge-skill balance. **Dark Souls** keeps you at the edge of your ability—victory feels earned because failure was so close.

**Fellowship** aesthetic needs low mechanical challenge. **Jackbox Games** keep mechanics trivial so players can focus on social interaction, not system mastery.

**Submission** aesthetic needs gentle, predictable flow. **Euro Truck Simulator 2** (2012) creates meditative flow through repetitive but satisfying driving loops.

**Discovery** aesthetic needs irregular rewards. **Breath of the Wild** breaks flow deliberately—korok seeds and shrines interrupt whatever you were doing, rewarding exploration over goal pursuit.

### Designing Effective Loops

**Keep micro loops tight**. The faster the feedback, the more engaging the experience. **Vampire Survivors** (2022) has an incredibly tight micro loop—enemies constantly approach, attacks constantly fire, experience constantly accumulates. Players can't look away.

**Make core loops complete**. Each cycle should feel satisfying on its own. **Hades** makes each run complete—you always reach an ending (death or escape), always earn permanent rewards (darkness, keys, nectar), always progress relationships. Even failure feels like progress.

**Give meta loops meaning**. Long-term goals must feel worthwhile. **Persona 5** (2017) makes its calendar system meaningful—you're not just getting stronger, you're deepening relationships, solving mysteries, changing society.

**Allow loop breaking**. Pure repetition becomes monotonous. **Spelunky 2** (2020) has a consistent core loop but adds secret areas, special events, and alternate paths. The loop provides structure, variations provide interest.

### When Loops Fail

**Loop Interruption** breaks flow. **Red Dead Redemption 2** (2018) constantly interrupts its loops with animations—looting requires watching Arthur bend down, search, stand up. Realistic but flow-breaking.

**Loop Confusion** loses players. **Death Stranding** (2019) has unclear loops initially—players don't understand the accept delivery → plan route → traverse terrain → deliver package → build infrastructure loop until hours in.

**Loop Exhaustion** causes burnout. **Destiny 2** (2017-present) has players repeat the same activities weekly for marginal gains. The loop works initially but becomes a chore over time.

**Loop Mismatch** conflicts with aesthetics. **SimCity** (2013) added always-online multiplayer to a traditionally Submission/Expression game. The social obligations broke the relaxing city-building loop many players wanted.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Core loop theory is fundamental to game design, validated across decades of research and practice.

## Section 5: The Seven System Functions

Beyond their structural components, game systems perform specific functions—the actual work that enables play. Understanding these functions helps designers identify what their system needs to do, not just how it's built. Different aesthetics prioritize different functions.

### Function 1: Adjudication (Resolving Uncertainty)

Every game needs to answer "what happens?" when outcomes are uncertain. Without adjudication, play stalls or devolves into argument.

**Dice** provide transparent randomness. D\&D's d20 makes every action a 5% increment—players understand the odds. **GM fiat** provides narrative flexibility. The GM decides what makes sense for the story. **Algorithms** provide complex calculations. **XCOM** calculates hit percentages from cover, range, abilities, and modifiers. **Consensus** provides collaborative authority. **Microscope** (2011) has players collectively decide what happens in history. **LLMs** could provide natural language interpretation—describe your action in words, receive narratively appropriate outcome.

Different aesthetics need different adjudication. Challenge needs consistency (same action, same result). Narrative needs flexibility (dramatic moments matter more than rules). Fellowship needs transparency (everyone understands why things happened).

### Function 2: Information Management (Controlling Knowledge)

Games thrive on information asymmetry—what players know, don't know, and discover. Systems must manage what information exists, who knows it, when it's revealed, and what happens if it's missed.

**Traditional models** gate everything. In classic **D\&D**, if you fail your investigation roll, you don't find the clue. Investigation can stall completely. **Gumshoe** guarantees core information. Have the right skill in the right place? You find the core clue automatically. Spend points for extra details. **Apocalypse World** generates information through play. "Read a Situation" moves create facts that didn't exist before rolling.

Information is a resource like HP or gold—design when it's scarce, when it's abundant, how it's earned, what it costs. Mystery games make information the primary currency. Horror games make information scarce and unreliable. Discovery games make information the reward for exploration.

### Function 3: Content Generation (Creating Situations)

Without new content, games end when prepared material runs out. Systems need ways to create novel situations, encounters, locations, and challenges.

**Pre-authored content** provides quality but limits quantity. **Curse of Strahd** (2016) offers exceptional content but only for one campaign. **Procedural generation** provides quantity but risks incoherence. **No Man's Sky** (2016) generates infinite planets but they can feel samey. **Random tables** combine authored and procedural. **Stars Without Number** (2010) uses tables to combine pre-written elements into novel configurations. **Player contribution** makes players co-creators. **Fiasco** (2011) has players build the entire scenario from prompt cards.

LLMs could provide coherent improvisation—maintaining consistency while generating appropriate content on demand. The challenge is avoiding generic "AI slop" while preserving authorial voice.

### Function 4: State Persistence (Remembering Across Time)

Games need memory. Character growth, world changes, relationship evolution—these require the system to remember what happened and make it matter.

**Character sheets** track mechanical state. Level, HP, inventory, abilities. **Campaign logs** track narrative state. What happened, who you met, what you learned. **Faction systems** track world state. **Blades in the Dark** uses clocks and faction status to remember how organizations respond to player actions. **Save files** perfectly preserve everything. But sometimes too much—**Skyrim** remembers every moved cheese wheel, creating save bloat.

Different play patterns need different persistence. Weekly games can rely on player memory. Monthly games need extensive notes. **West Marches** campaigns distribute memory across many players through shared wikis. Video games handle persistence automatically but often fail at narrative continuity—NPCs repeat the same dialogue despite world-changing events.

### Function 5: Cognitive Encoding (Shaping Thought)

Mechanics don't just resolve actions—they shape how players think about problems. The system teaches players what matters, what's possible, and how to approach situations.

**Attributes define what matters**. D\&D's six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) tell players these are the fundamental character traits. **Honey Heist** (2017) has only two stats: CRIMINAL and BEAR. This tells players everything about what kind of game this is.

**Actions define possibilities**. **Apocalypse World** moves name specific actions: "Go Aggro," "Seduce or Manipulate," "Read a Situation." Players think in terms of these moves. **Lasers & Feelings** (2013) has only two actions: LASERS (technology/reason) and FEELINGS (intuition/passion). Every problem becomes one or the other.

**Resources define values**. **Call of Cthulhu** tracks Sanity—immediately establishing that mental health matters and will be threatened. **Blades in the Dark** tracks Stress—telling players that pushing yourself has psychological cost.

This encoding can create specific experiences. Want players to think like alien minds? Create attributes that don't map to human concepts. Want players to avoid violence? Make violent actions mechanically inferior to alternatives.

### Function 6: Constraint Design (Creating Meaningful Limitations)

Constraints make games interesting. Unlimited resources, unlimited actions, unlimited time—these create boredom, not fun. Systems must create the right constraints for their aesthetic.

**Resource constraints** force prioritization. Limited spell slots make wizards choose carefully. Limited ammunition makes shooters conserve bullets. Limited time makes every action count. **Action constraints** create tactical depth. **Chess** pieces have specific movement patterns. **Into the Breach** mechs have specific abilities. Constraints create puzzles. **Victory constraints** shape strategy. **Twilight Struggle** (2005) limits victory to specific conditions—control regions, cause nuclear war (both lose), or reach turn 10 with most victory points.

Different aesthetics need different constraints. Challenge needs tight constraints that require optimal play. Expression needs loose constraints that allow creativity. Fellowship needs constraints that encourage cooperation over competition.

### Function 7: Procedural Content for Solo Play

Not all games have GMs or opponents. Systems need ways to generate opposition, situations, and narrative without human control.

**AI opponents** simulate human players. **Civilization** AI controls rival nations. Quality varies wildly—some feel human-like, others expose their algorithms immediately. **Oracle systems** answer questions. **Ironsworn** uses yes/no/yes-but/no-and oracles to resolve uncertainties in solo or co-op play. **Automated procedures** run themselves. **Four Against Darkness** (2016) uses tables and flowcharts to generate complete dungeon adventures. **Card-driven events** create narrative. **Robinson Crusoe** (2012) uses event cards to create story without a narrator.

Solo play is growing as people seek gaming experiences that fit their schedules. Systems that support good solo play expand their audience significantly.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - System functions are observable across all games, though their implementation varies.

## Section 6: How Components Create Dynamics

### The Emergence of Play

Dynamics are the behaviors that emerge when mechanics meet players. They're not designed directly—they arise from how components interact. You design mechanics and parameters, set context and pacing, ensure configuration coherence. Dynamics emerge from player interaction with this system.

### Mechanics + Parameters = Behavioral Patterns

Same mechanics with different parameters create entirely different dynamics:

**Rocket Jumping** emerged in **Quake** (1996). The mechanics: rockets have knockback, players have HP, explosion physics exist. The parameters: knockback is high, self-damage is manageable, maps have high places. The dynamic: players deliberately shoot rockets at their feet to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Id Software didn't design rocket jumping—players discovered it.

**Camping** emerges in battle royales. The mechanics: large map, shrinking circle, one life per match. The parameters: dying means waiting for next match, circle shrinks slowly, buildings provide cover. The dynamic: some players hide and avoid combat until forced. Developers didn't intend camping—it emerges from risk-averse play.

**Min-maxing** emerges in RPGs. The mechanics: character customization, statistical benefits, optimization possible. The parameters: some choices are mathematically superior, respecs are limited or costly. The dynamic: players sacrifice character concept for mechanical advantage. Designers create character options—players create spreadsheets.

### Context Transforms Meaning

Context changes how players interpret and approach identical mechanics:

**Permadeath** in **XCOM** creates attachment to soldiers. You name them after friends, mourn their loss, play cautiously to preserve them. **Permadeath** in **Rogue Legacy** (2013) creates humor. Your descendants have randomized genetic traits—one might be colorblind, another have IBS. Death is funny, not tragic.

**Collection** in **Pokémon** creates adventure. You're exploring the world, making friends with creatures. **Collection** in **Shin Megami Tensei** creates moral complexity. You're enslaving demons through negotiation or force. Same mechanic (creature collection), different context, different player behavior.

### Pacing Emerges from Parameters

Pacing isn't designed directly—it emerges from how quickly resources recover, how fast threats escalate, how long tasks take:

**Dark Souls** creates methodical pacing through:

* Slow healing animation (can't panic-heal)
* Limited healing items (conserve for bosses)
* Corpse runs (death has time cost)
* Checkpoint spacing (progress feels precious)

Nobody programmed "be methodical"—it emerges from parameters.

**DOOM Eternal** (2020) creates aggressive pacing through:

* Glory kills restore health (offense is defense)
* Chainsaw kills restore ammo (killing solves scarcity)
* Constant movement bonuses (standing still is death)
* Arena design (no safe spaces)

Nobody programmed "be aggressive"—it emerges from parameters.

### Configuration Coherence Creates Clear Dynamics

When all components pull in the same direction, dynamics become clear and satisfying:

**Hades** achieves configuration coherence:

* Mechanics: Tight combat with builds that emerge from boon combinations
* Parameters: Death resets runs but preserves meta-progression
* Context: Zagreus repeatedly escaping creates narrative justification for repetition
* Pacing: Each run takes 30-40 minutes—perfect session length
* Configuration: Everything serves "one more run" dynamic

Players naturally fall into the intended pattern: attempt escape, die, chat with NPCs, upgrade, attempt again. The dynamic feels inevitable because every component pushes toward it.

**Anthem** (2019) suffered configuration incoherence:

* Mechanics: Flying iron man suits suggests freedom
* Parameters: Constant tethering to teammates contradicts freedom
* Context: You're freelancer mercenary suggests independence
* Pacing: Long loading screens between every activity breaks flow
* Configuration: Components fight each other

Players felt the friction. The game wanted to be single-player power fantasy and multiplayer looter simultaneously. Components pulled in different directions, creating unsatisfying dynamics.

### Designing for Dynamics

You can't control dynamics directly, but you can shape them:

**Identify desired behavior**. What do you want players to do? Rush forward? Think carefully? Cooperate? Compete?

**Design components to encourage that behavior**. Want rushing? Make resources regenerate quickly, make standing still dangerous. Want thinking? Make resources scarce, make mistakes costly.

**Test whether dynamics emerge**. Players will surprise you. They'll find strategies you didn't anticipate, exploit systems you thought were balanced, avoid content you thought was mandatory.

**Adjust components, not dynamics**. You can't patch player behavior directly. You change mechanics, tune parameters, clarify context, adjust pacing. The dynamics shift in response.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - The relationship between components and dynamics is fundamental to all system design.

## Section 7: Reading the Rest of This Book

### The Journey Ahead

This chapter established the foundation—what game systems are, what they're made of, what they do. The remaining chapters explore how to build on this foundation, each tackling a crucial aspect of game design.

### Chapter 2: Resource Management

Resources are the currencies that create meaningful choices. HP, gold, ammunition, time, attention—these create scarcity that forces prioritization.

You'll learn:

* Five resource types (Consumable, Buffer, Accumulation, Composition, Capacity)
* How recovery patterns determine pacing
* Psychological effects of ownership, scarcity, and loss
* How to match resources to aesthetics
* Common resource anti-patterns to avoid

This chapter builds on the Components framework, showing how Parameters (scarcity levels, recovery rates) create different dynamics from the same resource Mechanics.

### Chapter 3: Cognitive Load and Game System Design

Every game demands mental effort. Tracking resources, evaluating options, remembering rules, recognizing patterns—these create cognitive load that shapes who can play and how they experience your game.

You'll learn:

* Seven types of cognitive load (Simultaneity, Decision, Memory, Tracking, Calculation, Pattern Recognition, Social)
* How different aesthetics require different load profiles
* Load as design constraint, not resource
* Supporting necessary load vs. removing unnecessary load
* How player expertise changes load over time

This chapter connects to every other aspect of design—resources create tracking load, balance must be perceivable despite load, context affects memory load, pacing must account for cognitive fatigue.

### Chapter 4: From Principles to Numbers (Balance)

Balance isn't about making everything equal—it's about creating appropriate challenge for your chosen aesthetic. Different aesthetics need different balance paradigms.

You'll learn:

* Three balance paradigms (Framework, Consistency, Adaptive)
* How to match paradigm to aesthetic
* Concrete balancing formulas and measurables
* Why balance must be perceivable, not just mathematical
* Playtesting protocols for validation

This chapter synthesizes previous concepts, showing how Components must be configured coherently, how cognitive load affects perceived balance, and how resources create the levers for balancing.

### Chapter 5: Context - From Setting to Experience

Context transforms abstract mechanics into meaningful experiences. Genre determines required dynamics. Dressing provides aesthetic wrapper. Perspective maintains emotional tone.

You'll learn:

* Genre vs. dressing distinction
* How context shapes player behavior
* Build/Suggest/Omit framework for worldbuilding
* Perspective coherence across all elements
* How the same mechanics create different games through context

This chapter reveals how Context (Component 3) isn't just flavor—it fundamentally shapes how players approach your game, what dynamics emerge, and whether your scaffold achieves its purpose.

### Chapter 6: Synthesis (Planned)

The book concludes with complete worked examples, showing all frameworks operating together:

* Full game designs from aesthetic to implementation
* Diagnostic tools for when games aren't working
* Integration patterns for LLM augmentation
* Validation protocols for testing experiential scaffolds

### How to Use This Book

**If you're designing a new game**: Read chapters in order. Each builds on the previous, giving you tools to construct your experiential scaffold systematically.

**If you're fixing an existing game**: Jump to the relevant chapter. Game feels tedious? Check pacing in Chapter 4. Players confused? Check cognitive load in Chapter 3. Mechanics feel meaningless? Check context in Chapter 5.

**If you're analyzing games**: Use the frameworks as lenses. What aesthetic does this serve? What functions does it perform? What cognitive load does it create? How are its resources balanced?

**If you're integrating LLMs**: Pay special attention to System Functions (this chapter) and Information Management (Chapter 2). LLMs excel at some functions, fail at others. Design accordingly.

## Chapter Summary

### Key Principles

**Games are experiential scaffolds**. They're not about mechanics—they're about the experiences those mechanics enable. The scaffold exists to support the experience.

**Design from purpose**. Start with your intended aesthetic, then design components to achieve it. Don't start with cool mechanics and hope they create something meaningful.

**Configuration coherence matters**. All five components (Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing, Configuration) must serve the same aesthetic. Incoherence creates friction players feel even if they can't articulate it.

**Dynamics emerge**. You don't design player behavior directly—you design components that encourage certain dynamics. Players will surprise you.

**Systems perform functions**. Beyond their structure, systems do work: adjudicate outcomes, manage information, generate content, persist state, encode cognition, create constraints, enable solo play. Different aesthetics prioritize different functions.

**Core loops create engagement**. The micro loop creates flow, the core loop defines the game, the meta loop provides purpose. All three must align with your aesthetic.

### The Aesthetic-First Design Process

1. **Choose your primary aesthetic**. What experience do you want players to have? Use the twelve aesthetics as starting points.

2. **Identify required functions**. What work must your system perform? Mystery needs information management. Horror needs constraint design. Fellowship needs low adjudication overhead.

3. **Design components coherently**. Create mechanics that serve your aesthetic. Set parameters that encourage desired dynamics. Choose context that reinforces meaning. Tune pacing through parameters. Ensure configuration coherence.

4. **Construct appropriate loops**. Design micro loops that create appropriate flow. Build core loops that deliver your aesthetic. Create meta loops that provide long-term purpose.

5. **Manage cognitive load deliberately**. Know what mental effort your game demands. Support necessary load, remove unnecessary load. Match load profile to aesthetic.

6. **Test whether scaffold achieves purpose**. Do players experience your intended aesthetic? If not, identify which component or function is failing. Adjust and test again.

### What's Next

Chapter 2 explores resources in depth—the currencies and constraints that create meaningful decisions. You'll learn how different resource types serve different aesthetics, how recovery patterns shape pacing, and how to design resource systems that support your experiential scaffold.

The journey from concept to playable game requires many decisions. This framework ensures those decisions align toward a coherent purpose: creating the experience you intended, supported by systems that make it possible.

The scaffold is not the destination. It's what makes the journey possible.

**Confidence Level for Chapter Overall**: HIGH for established concepts (MDA, components, functions), MEDIUM for our extensions (four additional aesthetics, specific categorizations), LOW for untested integrations (LLM functions, some dynamic predictions).
