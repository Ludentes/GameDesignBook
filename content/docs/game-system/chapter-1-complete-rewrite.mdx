# Chapter 1: Understanding Game Systems

Imagine three musicians at identical pianos.  
One plays bright jazz, one performs a rigid étude, one creates drifting ambient chords.  
Same instrument—three completely different experiences.

Game mechanics work the same way. Dice, cards, physics interactions—these are just instruments. What players feel comes not from the mechanics themselves but from **how they’re arranged, paced, constrained, and framed**. The keys don’t determine the music; the composition does.

You can see this everywhere in game design. _Breath of the Wild_ and _Getting Over It_, for example, both rely on physics-driven interactions—momentum, friction, timing. Same underlying substrate. Yet one produces playful curiosity and joyful experimentation, while the other cultivates tension, frustration, and a very deliberate sense of struggle. Same instrument, different music.

This contrast becomes even sharper when a single studio reuses the same mechanics intentionally. Weatherfactory’s _Cultist Simulator_ and _Book of Hours_ are built from nearly identical parts: cards, verbs, timers. Yet _Cultist Simulator_ is frantic and perilous, while _Book of Hours_ is calm and meditative. Nothing about the core mechanics changed; what changed was the **system**—the configuration of stakes, pacing, constraints, and rewards that shapes the player’s experience.

And that is the point:  
**mechanics are ingredients, but systems are the recipes that produce reliable emotional outcomes.**

This book begins here, with the idea that game systems are not the rules themselves but the _experiential scaffolds_ built from them—the structures designers create so players can have specific kinds of experiences, consistently, through interaction.

## The Experiential Scaffold Framework

### What Is a Game System?

A game system is not simply "the rules." It's not a resolution mechanic (roll d20, draw cards, click buttons). It's not a collection of subsystems bolted together hoping they work.

**A game system is a purpose-built experiential scaffold**—a temporary structure that enables players to have experiences they couldn't otherwise access. Like construction scaffolding that lets workers reach heights they couldn't naturally achieve, game systems let players experience being heroes, villains, detectives, or even alien minds.

The scaffold metaphor is deliberate. Scaffolding:
- Has a specific purpose (reach this height, paint that wall)
- Is temporary (removed when the work is done)
- Isn't the point (the building matters, not the scaffold)
- Must be stable enough to support the work
- Can be constructed many ways for the same purpose

Similarly, game systems:
- Have experiential purposes (feel clever, feel powerful, feel scared)
- Exist during play (disappear when you stop playing)
- Aren't the point (the experience matters, not the system)
- Must be coherent enough to support the experience
- Can be designed many ways for the same aesthetic

### Purpose-First Design

Traditional game design often starts with mechanics. "What if we used cards instead of dice?" "What if players bid for actions?" "What if time moved backward?" These can lead to interesting games, but they're solving from the wrong end.

**Purpose-first design inverts this process**. Start with the experience you want players to have, then design backward to the system that creates it. This is the reversal at the heart of the MDA framework (Hunicke, LeBlanc, Zubek, 2004):

- **Players experience**: Aesthetics → Dynamics → Mechanics (working inward)
- **Designers create**: Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics (working outward)
- **But designers should START with**: Aesthetics (what experience?) → then design mechanics to achieve it

Consider **Dread** (Horror RPG, 2005, Tabletop). The designers didn't start with "let's use a Jenga tower." They started with wanting players to feel mounting tension and inevitable collapse. The Jenga tower emerged as the perfect mechanic for that experience: every action literally makes the next action harder, collapse is inevitable but unpredictable, and the physical act of pulling blocks creates actual tension in players' bodies.

### Why This Matters for Designers

**Configuration coherence** becomes testable. If your purpose is Challenge (overcoming difficulty through skill), then every component should serve that purpose:
- Mechanics that reward pattern recognition
- Parameters that make failure costly but fair
- Context that frames struggle as heroic
- Pacing that allows learning from failure

If any component contradicts the purpose—mechanics that randomize success, parameters that trivialize failure, context that makes struggle seem pointless—the scaffold becomes unstable. Players feel the incoherence even if they can't articulate it.

**Trade-offs become explicit**. You can't maximize all aesthetics simultaneously. A game optimized for Fellowship (social interaction) needs different cognitive load than one optimized for Challenge (skill development). Understanding your primary purpose lets you make consistent decisions when aesthetics conflict.

**Validation becomes possible**. "Is this game good?" is unanswerable. "Does this scaffold successfully create the intended experience?" is testable. You can observe whether players feel clever in your mystery game, whether they feel powerful in your power fantasy, whether they feel connected in your social game.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - This framework is validated across thousands of games and decades of design practice.

## The Aesthetics Framework

### Understanding Aesthetics

The MDA framework introduced aesthetics as "the desirable emotional responses evoked in the player." These aren't genres (fantasy, sci-fi) or mechanics (turn-based, real-time). They're the fundamental experiences players seek from games.

Think of aesthetics as the answer to "Why do people play this?" Not "to roll dice" or "to manage resources" but "to feel clever" or "to overcome challenges" or "to express creativity."

### MDA's Foundation

The original MDA framework identified eight fundamental aesthetics:

1. **Sensation** - Game as sense-pleasure. Beautiful art, satisfying sound effects, visceral feedback.
2. **Fantasy** - Game as make-believe. Being someone else, somewhere else.
3. **Narrative** - Game as drama. Stories that unfold, characters that grow, plots that resolve.
4. **Challenge** - Game as obstacle course. Difficulties to overcome through skill and persistence.
5. **Fellowship** - Game as social framework. Playing together, bonding through shared experience.
6. **Discovery** - Game as uncharted territory. Finding new things, uncovering secrets.
7. **Expression** - Game as self-discovery. Creating something uniquely yours.
8. **Submission** - Game as pastime. Relaxing, turning your brain off, entering flow state.

This provided crucial vocabulary for discussing player experiences. But in practice, we've found the framework needs both refinement and expansion.

### The Practical Reality: Common Aesthetics

**Through years of design work, we've observed these aesthetics appearing most frequently:**

**Activity-Based Aesthetics** (what players DO in games):

**Challenge** - Overcoming obstacles through skill and persistence. **Celeste** (2018) requires precise platforming. **Wordle** (2022) demands pattern recognition and deduction. **Portal** (2007) creates puzzle-solving satisfaction. Distinct from Mastery: Challenge is about overcoming difficulty, not necessarily understanding systems deeply.

**Discovery** - Finding and learning new things, uncovering secrets. **Outer Wilds** (2019) hides mysteries across a solar system. **Return of the Obra Dinn** (2018) makes deduction the core experience. **Breath of the Wild** (2017) rewards exploration in every direction.

**Mastery** - Deeply understanding and optimizing systems over time. **Street Fighter** series has infinite depth in its fighting systems. **Path of Exile** rewards understanding interconnected build mechanics. **Factorio** (2020) offers endless optimization of production chains. Distinct from Challenge: Mastery is about understanding, not just overcoming.

**Expression** - Creating and showing personal creativity. **Minecraft** (2011) provides blocks to build anything. **The Sims** (2000) lets you create and control virtual lives. **Dreams** (2020) offers game creation tools.

**Fellowship** - Social connection and collaboration. **It Takes Two** (2021) requires genuine cooperation. **Among Us** (2020) creates social deduction experiences. **Animal Crossing** (2020) builds community through shared spaces.

**Submission** - Relaxation, turning your brain off, entering flow state. **Stardew Valley** (2016) offers gentle farming rhythms. **Euro Truck Simulator 2** (2012) creates meditative long-haul driving. **Cookie Clicker** (2013) provides passive progression satisfaction. This is not "easy Challenge"—it's a fundamentally different goal.

**Progression** - Growing stronger and more capable over time. **Diablo** series perfected the loot-and-level loop. **RuneScape** (2001-present) became synonymous with grinding for progression. **Hades** (2020) uses permanent upgrades to drive repeated runs. Distinct from Expression: Progression is about advancement, not creativity.

**Completion** - Achieving goals and finishing tasks. **Portal** provides satisfying puzzle closure. **Monument Valley** (2014) offers clear level completion. **Unpacking** (2021) creates satisfaction through finishing organization tasks.

**Emotion-Based Aesthetics** (what players FEEL during play):

**Tension** - Time pressure, high stakes, constant danger. **XCOM** series puts every decision under pressure. **Dead Cells** (2018) creates moment-to-moment stakes. Distinct from Challenge: you can have high-tension easy games or low-tension hard games.

**Wonder** - Experiencing awe and beauty. **Journey** (2012) creates transcendent moments through visuals and music. **Ori and the Blind Forest** (2015) delivers beauty as the primary draw—you play to experience the world, not primarily for the platforming.

**Social-Structure Aesthetics** (how players relate):

**Competition** - Testing yourself against others. **Rocket League** (2015) creates skill-based competition. **Counter-Strike** (1999-present) is pure competitive experience—remove other players and the game loses its entire appeal, regardless of how good the shooting mechanics are.

### When Common Aesthetics Aren't Enough

Sometimes you need more precision than the common aesthetics provide. If you're designing a horror game, "tense Discovery" doesn't capture what you're actually building. You're designing for **horror**—dread, fear, vulnerability, complicity in terrible acts. That's a specific aesthetic that deserves its own identity.

**Examples of going deeper:**

**Horror** - Not just tense Discovery, but experiencing dread and moral complicity. **Amnesia: The Dark Descent** (2010) creates helplessness. The aesthetic is the fear itself.

**Grief** - Processing loss and moral weight. **This War of Mine** (2014) makes you experience civilian suffering during war. The aesthetic is grief and complicity, not Challenge or Narrative.

**Roleplay/Simulation** - Inhabiting a specific role. Farming simulators aren't just Submission—they're about being a farmer. Submarine simulations aren't just Mastery—they're about experiencing command. The roleplay itself is the aesthetic.

**When to define your own aesthetic:**
- The common aesthetics don't capture your specific goal
- You keep saying "no, it's not just X, it's specifically about Y"
- Your design decisions become clearer with a more precise aesthetic

If "Wonder" captures your goal, use it. If you need "experiencing the sublime beauty of nature through low-stress exploration," define that. Trust your design instincts.

### The Universal Principles

**Here's what doesn't change regardless of your specific aesthetic:**

**Configuration coherence matters**. All five components (Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing, Configuration) must serve your aesthetic—whether that's Challenge, Horror, Wonder, or "experiencing grief in wartime." **Papers, Please** (2013) serves Challenge through every component: mechanics (document checking), parameters (time pressure), context (authoritarian bureaucracy), pacing (escalating complexity).

**Investment capacity constrains aesthetics**. Casual players can access Submission and Wonder but not Mastery (requires sustained investment). Hardcore players need Challenge or Mastery depth but find pure Submission boring (under-utilizes their capacity). Your aesthetic must match your audience's ability to engage.

**Loop architecture follows aesthetic**. Different aesthetics need different temporal structures. Challenge needs tight micro loops for skill expression. Discovery needs varied meso loops to prevent repetition. Submission needs relaxing micro loops without meta pressure. Match your loops to your aesthetic goals.

**Functions serve aesthetics**. Challenge aesthetic needs instant adjudication and clear feedback at micro scale. Discovery aesthetic needs information management at meso scale. Horror aesthetic might need limited feedback (uncertainty is the point). Choose functions appropriate to your aesthetic.

**Dynamics emerge from configuration**. You don't design player behavior directly—you design components that encourage desired behaviors. This works for any aesthetic: Challenge components encourage pattern learning, Horror components encourage cautious exploration, Submission components encourage relaxed engagement.

### How This Book Uses Aesthetics

**Throughout this book, we focus examples on the most common aesthetics:**
- Challenge, Discovery, Mastery (the workhorses of game design)
- Fellowship, Expression, Progression (the social and creative pillars)
- Submission (the relaxation aesthetic)

**Why these?** Because they're common. Most games pursue variations of these experiences. Using them in examples makes the frameworks immediately applicable.

**But the frameworks work for any aesthetic.** Whether you're designing for Wonder, Horror, Grief, Competition, or "experiencing life as a submarine captain," the principles in this book apply. You're still building an experiential scaffold, choosing components that serve your goal, managing cognitive load, designing loops. The specific aesthetic just changes which choices you make.

**Aesthetic precision enables progress.** "Make a fun game" provides no design direction. "Create Challenge aesthetic for casual players through 20-minute puzzle sessions with clear completion goals" gives you a target feeling (Challenge), target audience (casual), time constraint (20 minutes), structure hint (puzzle sessions), and supporting aesthetic (Completion). Every mechanic, resource, and parameter can be evaluated against this profile.

Know what experience you're creating. Be as specific as necessary. Use the common aesthetics as starting vocabulary, but define your own when needed. Then apply the frameworks to achieve it.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH for MDA's foundation and common aesthetics observed in practice. The pragmatic approach acknowledges that rigid taxonomies matter less than precise design goals.

## Who Climbs Your Scaffold?

A perfectly designed experiential scaffold fails if the wrong players try to climb it. Mastery requires sustained cognitive investment—casual players can't access it. Fellowship requires social coordination—solo players won't experience it. Challenge requires skill development time—players with 10-minute sessions can't engage with it.

**Your aesthetic choice must match your players' capacity to invest**. This isn't about dumbing things down or limiting ambition—it's about understanding who can actually experience what you're building.

### Cognitive Investment Profiles: The Primary Framework

The most useful player classification isn't personality-based (Bartle types, Quantic Foundry motivations)—it's **investment capacity-based**. How much time, attention, and cognitive effort can players bring to your game?

Three profiles dominate the gaming landscape:

#### Casual Players (Largest Segment)

**Investment Capacity:**
- **Time**: 5-30 minutes per session
- **Cognitive Load**: Low tolerance (3±2 simultaneous elements to track)
- **Context**: Mobile devices, browsers, interruption-prone environments
- **Session Gaps**: Hours to days between sessions
- **Mental Model Persistence**: Can't maintain complex systems between sessions

**Accessible Aesthetics:**
- **Submission** (relaxation, flow state) - Primary draw
- **Fellowship** (if mechanics are simple) - Social games thrive here
- **Progression** (if progress is clear and fast) - Satisfying in short bursts
- **Challenge** (if difficulty resets per session) - Wordle succeeds with daily puzzles
- **Wonder** (if accessible in short sessions) - Monument Valley delivers beauty quickly

**Inaccessible Aesthetics:**
- **Mastery** - Requires sustained investment to build mental models
- **Tension** - Can't maintain stakes between interrupted sessions
- **Narrative** - Can't follow complex plots with long gaps

**Examples**: Wordle (daily Challenge), Candy Crush (Submission + Progression), Among Us (Fellowship with simple mechanics), Monument Valley (Wonder + brief Challenge)

**Design Implications:**
- Micro loops (30 seconds to 5 minutes) must be satisfying standalone
- Meso loops must complete within single session
- Macro loops either absent or extremely forgiving
- Aggressive recaps/reminders on session start
- Save/pause anywhere mandatory
- Tutorial integrated into first 60 seconds

#### Midcore Players (Growing Segment)

**Investment Capacity:**
- **Time**: 30-90 minutes per session
- **Cognitive Load**: Moderate tolerance (5-7 simultaneous systems)
- **Context**: Dedicated device (console, PC, phone with focus time)
- **Session Gaps**: Days to weeks between sessions
- **Mental Model Persistence**: Can maintain moderate complexity if reminded

**Accessible Aesthetics:**
- **All aesthetics accessible with appropriate design**
- **Mastery** - Can build system understanding over weeks
- **Progression** - Sweet spot for power growth loops
- **Challenge** - Can develop skills across sessions
- **Competition** - Ranked modes work well
- **Discovery** - Can explore but needs breadcrumbs

**Critical Design Zone:**
- This is the **bridge audience**—can access most aesthetics but needs careful scaffolding
- Session recaps essential (1-week gaps common)
- Tutorial/onboarding spread across 2-5 sessions
- Meta loops must show progress even with gaps
- Balance between depth and accessibility

**Examples**: Genshin Impact (Progression + Discovery), Clash Royale (Competition + Collection), Rocket League (Challenge + Mastery), Hades (Challenge + Narrative + Progression)

**Design Implications:**
- Micro loops create flow, meso loops fit in 45-60 minutes
- Macro loops provide long-term goals but don't punish gaps
- Return hooks important (daily rewards, new content drops)
- Complexity can exist but must be introduced gradually
- Session recap systems necessary
- "Rusty player" accommodation (tutorial reminders, practice modes)

#### Hardcore Players (Smallest but Loudest Segment)

**Investment Capacity:**
- **Time**: 2+ hours per session, multiple sessions per week
- **Cognitive Load**: High tolerance (complex systems welcome)
- **Context**: Dedicated setup, uninterrupted time
- **Session Gaps**: Hours to days (active engagement)
- **Mental Model Persistence**: Maintains complex mental models indefinitely

**Accessible Aesthetics:**
- **All aesthetics accessible**
- **Mastery** - Primary driver for this audience
- **Challenge** - Seeks high difficulty
- **Tension** - Can sustain high-stakes decisions
- **Discovery** - Will dig through wikis, experiment extensively
- **Competition** - Thrives on ranked ladders, tournaments

**Seeks Complexity:**
- High skill ceilings essential
- Deep interconnected systems valued
- Emergent complexity from interaction
- Optimization opportunities
- Meta-game evolution

**Examples**: Dark Souls (Challenge + Mastery), Path of Exile (Mastery + Progression + Collection), Civilization (Mastery + Tension + Challenge), Dwarf Fortress (Mastery + Discovery + emergent complexity)

**Design Implications:**
- Micro loops can be complex (multiple simultaneous decisions)
- Meso loops can span 30+ minutes
- Macro and meta loops span weeks to months (leagues, seasons, campaigns)
- No handholding required (wikis/community fill gaps)
- Depth prioritized over accessibility
- Skill expression through mastery of complexity
- Prestige markers for achievement (cosmetics, titles, rankings)

### The Busy Adult Problem: A Critical Modern Demographic

A growing demographic breaks the traditional classifications: **experienced players with casual time constraints**.

**Profile:**
- Gaming history (knows conventions, has skills)
- High disposable income (can pay for premium experiences)
- Minimal available time (careers, families, responsibilities)
- Rusty execution (reflexes/memory not what they were)
- Wants meaningful experiences, not time-wasters

**The Challenge:**
- **Wants** hardcore depth and narrative complexity
- **Has** casual time availability
- **Needs** design that respects both constraints

**Design Solutions:**
- **Aggressive session recaps**: "Last time you were pursuing the stolen artifact in the northern ruins"
- **Pause/save anywhere**: Respect interruptions
- **Meaningful progress in 30 minutes**: Each session should accomplish something
- **Reduce memorization load**: Journals, quest logs, in-game encyclopedias
- **Scalable difficulty**: Easy to pick up, room to demonstrate skill
- **Respect for player time**: No grinding, no time-gating, efficient meso and macro loops

**Examples that succeed**: God of War (2018) - complex story with session recaps, The Witcher 3 (with difficulty options), Hades (meaningful 30-minute runs), Disco Elysium (can pause mid-conversation)

**Why this matters**: This demographic has money and loyalty. They're underserved by both casual (too shallow) and hardcore (too demanding) designs. They represent a major market opportunity.

### Investment Determines Accessible Aesthetics

This is the critical insight: **aesthetic payoff must match cognitive investment capacity**.

**Why casual players can't access Mastery:**
- Mastery requires building deep mental models of interconnected systems
- Mental models decay between sessions
- 5-30 minute sessions can't sustain the learning required
- Not a skill issue—a time and continuity issue

**Why hardcore players find pure Submission boring:**
- High cognitive capacity seeking engagement
- Flow state requires appropriate challenge-skill balance
- Too-simple systems feel empty (under-utilizing capacity)
- They seek complexity to match their investment capacity

**The design challenge:**
- Know your target audience's investment capacity
- Choose aesthetics they can actually access
- Configure components to match that capacity
- Don't try to serve all investment levels equally (serves none well)

### A Note on Bartle Taxonomy and Other Frameworks

**Richard Bartle's player types** (Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, Killers) remain influential, particularly for multiplayer and MMO design. They describe player motivations:
- **Achievers** seek mastery and completion
- **Explorers** seek discovery and understanding  
- **Socializers** seek connection and community
- **Killers** seek competition and dominance

**Quantic Foundry's gaming motivations** provide data-driven categories (Action, Social, Mastery, Achievement, Immersion, Creativity) that map well to our aesthetics.

These frameworks are valuable for understanding **why** players engage. Chapter 3 (Cognitive Load) explores Bartle types in detail, particularly how different player types have different load preferences and tolerances.

**Why we prioritize cognitive investment profiles**:
- **More operationally useful**: Directly determines loop lengths, load budgets, session structures
- **More fundamental**: Investment capacity constrains which aesthetics are accessible
- **Aesthetic-first alignment**: Our approach starts with aesthetic goals, investment capacity determines feasibility
- **Clear design implications**: Knowing "casual players" immediately tells you session length, load budget, loop architecture

**The frameworks work together**:
- **Cognitive investment** (casual/midcore/hardcore) → determines what's possible
- **Aesthetics** (common starting points) → determines what you're building
- **Player types** (Bartle, Quantic) → helps understand motivations and preferences

### Practical Application: The Investment-Aesthetic Matrix

When starting a design, answer three questions:

**1. What aesthetic do I want to create?**
- Choose from the common aesthetics (or define your own if needed)
- Be specific about primary vs. secondary aesthetics

**2. What investment capacity does this aesthetic require?**
- Mastery → Hardcore or dedicated Midcore
- Fellowship → Depends on mechanical complexity
- Submission → Often Casual, but can be Hardcore (Tetris flow masters)
- Challenge → Depends on skill development time required

**3. Who is my target audience?**
- What's their available time per session?
- What's their cognitive load tolerance?
- What's their play context (mobile/interrupted vs. dedicated)?
- Can they access my chosen aesthetic given these constraints?

**If there's a mismatch**: Either change your aesthetic choice or change your target audience. You cannot make a Mastery-focused game for casual players—the math doesn't work.

### Why This Matters for the Rest of the Book

Every subsequent chapter builds on these foundations:

**Resources (Chapter 2)**: Casual players need simpler resource economies (3±2 trackables). Hardcore players can manage complex interdependent resource webs.

**Cognitive Load (Chapter 3)**: Investment capacity determines load budget. Provides detailed treatment of player types and load preferences.

**Balance (Chapter 4)**: Different audiences need different balance paradigms. Casual players need forgiving systems, hardcore players demand precision.

**Context (Chapter 5)**: Genre complexity must match investment capacity. Busy adults want rich narratives but need strong recaps.

**Temporal Architecture (Chapter 6)**: Loop lengths must match available session time. Investment capacity determines loop architecture (compressed vs. expansive).

**The fundamental constraint**: You're not just building an experiential scaffold—you're building it **for specific people with specific capacities**. The most brilliant design fails if it demands more investment than players can provide, or provides less depth than players seek.

Know who will climb your scaffold. Build for them.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Investment capacity framework validated across industry practice, player research, and market segmentation data.

## Analyzing Game Systems: The Five Components

When analyzing existing game systems or understanding how they work, it's useful to think in terms of five components. Every system—whether tabletop or digital, simple or complex—contains these elements. Understanding them helps you see what makes systems tick and why some configurations work while others don't.

**The Five Components:**

**1. Mechanics** - What players can do (actions, verbs, resolution systems)  
**2. Parameters** - How much, how fast, how scarce (the numbers that create feel)  
**3. Context** - What it means (setting, tone, fiction that gives meaning to mechanics)  
**4. Temporal Structure** - When things happen (loop scales, pacing, session architecture)  
**5. Configuration** - How it all aligns toward the aesthetic goal

These components aren't design steps—they're **analytical lenses**. You don't sit down and "design Component 1, then Component 2." Instead, you make specific design decisions using frameworks from later chapters, and these components help you understand how those decisions work together.

### Component 1: Mechanics (What Players Can Do)

Mechanics are the verbs of your game—the actions players can take and how the system resolves them.

**Resolution systems** determine outcomes. **D&D** uses d20 + modifier vs. difficulty class—transparent and swingy. **Powered by the Apocalypse** uses 2d6 + stat with three outcome tiers—predictable bell curve with guaranteed forward movement. **Into the Breach** uses perfect information—no randomness, pure tactical calculation.

**Action spaces** define possibilities. **Chess** has rigidly constrained piece movements. **Divinity: Original Sin 2** offers vast possibility space (attack, cast, use items, manipulate environment, combine elements). **Wordle** allows only five-letter word guesses—extremely constrained but perfectly suited to its purpose.

The best mechanics fade into the background. Players think about what they want to do, not how the system works.

### Component 2: Parameters (How Much, How Fast, How Scarce)

Parameters are the numbers and constraints that determine feel. Same mechanics with different parameters create completely different experiences.

**Scarcity** shapes decisions. In **XCOM 2**, soldiers are precious—losing one hurts. In **Total War**, soldiers are expendable—thousands die per battle. Same mechanic (unit combat), different scarcity, different experience.

**Speed** creates pressure. **StarCraft** measures actions-per-minute—speed is skill. **Civilization** has no time pressure—contemplation is encouraged. **FTL** lets you pause anytime—tactical planning under narrative pressure.

**Recovery** determines pacing. Modern shooters regenerate health in seconds—aggressive play rewarded. **Resident Evil** requires finding herbs—conservative play rewarded. **Darkest Dungeon** makes stress persist between missions—consequences accumulate.

Parameters do heavy lifting without adding complexity. You don't need new mechanics for horror—just make resources scarce, recovery slow, and threats lethal.

### Component 3: Context (What It Means)

Context transforms abstract mechanics into meaningful experiences. Rolling dice becomes sword fighting, card play becomes occult research, moving tokens becomes commanding armies.

**Setting provides fictional framework.** **Pandemic** and **Forbidden Island** have nearly identical mechanics—collect sets of cards to remove threats from a map. But Pandemic feels urgent (diseases spreading) while Forbidden Island feels adventurous (treasure hunting). The mechanics didn't change—the meaning did.

**Tone affects decision-making.** **This War of Mine** and **Fallout Shelter** both involve post-apocalyptic resource management. But This War of Mine's serious tone makes stealing medicine feel weighty, while Fallout Shelter's cartoonish tone makes sending dwellers to their doom feel lighthearted.

Context must align with mechanics. **Call of Cthulhu** investigators who solve problems by punching monsters breaks the horror context. The mechanics (fragile investigators, sanity loss) reinforce the context (cosmic horror, human insignificance).

### Component 4: Temporal Structure (When Things Happen)

Temporal structure is how experience unfolds across time—from second-to-second actions to session-to-session progression.

**Loop scales** create rhythm. **Vampire Survivors** has tight micro loops (constant action-feedback), clear meso loops (level-ups every 60-90 seconds), and fixed macro loops (30-minute runs). **Civilization** has micro loops (individual turns), meso loops (era progression), macro loops (complete games spanning hours), and meta loops (campaigns across multiple games).

**Pacing emerges** from how temporal structure interacts with parameters. Fast recovery + low scarcity = aggressive pacing. Slow recovery + high scarcity = cautious pacing. **Monster Hunter** creates episodic pacing (hunt → craft → hunt stronger monster). **Slay the Spire** creates wave pacing within runs (combat → rest → combat).

Temporal structure isn't a separate system you build—it's how your other components unfold across time. Chapter 6 (Temporal Architecture) provides detailed frameworks for designing loop scales and pacing patterns.

### Component 5: Configuration (How It All Aligns)

Configuration is how components work together toward your aesthetic goal. Coherent configuration makes systems feel purposeful. Incoherent configuration makes them feel arbitrary.

**Configuration coherence test**: For each component, ask "Does this serve my primary aesthetic?"

**D&D for mystery investigation** fails this test:
- Mechanics (combat-focused) → Serves Challenge, not Discovery
- Parameters (resource attrition) → Serves Challenge, not Discovery  
- Context (heroic fantasy) → Could serve Discovery
- Temporal Structure (encounter-based) → Serves Challenge, not Discovery

Result: Players solve mysteries by beating up suspects.

**Gumshoe for mystery investigation** passes this test:
- Mechanics (automatic clue discovery) → Serves Discovery
- Parameters (point pools for bonuses) → Serves Discovery
- Context (detective fiction) → Serves Discovery
- Temporal Structure (scene-based investigation) → Serves Discovery

Result: Players solve mysteries by investigating.

Configuration coherence doesn't mean everything must be identical—it means everything must pull in the same direction. **Return of the Obra Dinn** uses wildly different components (3D exploration, deduction interface, time-freeze mechanic) but they all serve Discovery aesthetic.

### Using Components for Analysis

**The Five Components lens is powerful for understanding existing games:**

**Weather Factory's games** demonstrate component power. **Cultist Simulator** and **Book of Hours** share identical Mechanics (card-and-timer system) but differ in Parameters (scarcity, recovery speed, time pressure), Context (occult horror vs. cozy library), and Temporal Structure (frantic vs. relaxed pacing). Same mechanical foundation, completely different experiences through component configuration.

**When analyzing a game**, ask:
- What Mechanics does it use? (action verbs, resolution systems)
- What Parameters create its feel? (scarcity levels, speeds, recovery rates)
- What Context gives it meaning? (setting, tone, victory conditions)
- What Temporal Structure organizes it? (loop scales, pacing patterns)
- Does Configuration align toward a coherent aesthetic?

### From Analysis to Design

**When you actually design a game, you won't work through "Component 1, Component 2..."** Instead, you'll make specific decisions using specialized frameworks:

**Chapter 2: Resource Management** - Designing resource economies (types, scarcity, recovery patterns)

**Chapter 3: Cognitive Load** - Managing complexity budgets across mechanics and systems

**Chapter 4: From Principles to Numbers** - Setting numerical parameters for balance

**Chapter 5: Context** - Creating setting, tone, and perspective that serve your aesthetic

**Chapter 6: Temporal Architecture** - Designing loop scales, pacing patterns, and session structure

These chapters provide operational frameworks for design. The Five Components provide analytical framework for understanding.

**Think of it this way:** Components help you understand what makes games work. The specialized chapters help you build games that work. Both are necessary—analysis informs design, design creates systems worth analyzing.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Five Components as analytical framework validated across hundreds of game analyses.

## Temporal Architecture: Loop Scales

### Understanding Loops

Loops are the temporal geometry of experiential scaffolds—the cycles of action and feedback that players repeat at different time scales. Every game has loops operating at multiple scales simultaneously. Understanding loop architecture helps you shape player experience from moment-to-moment engagement to long-term commitment.

**The key insight:** Not all games need all loop scales. Match your loop architecture to your aesthetic goals and your players' investment capacity.

### The Four Loop Scales

Games can operate at four distinct temporal scales. Different aesthetics and different player audiences require different combinations:

**Micro Loops** (seconds to minutes) - Immediate action-feedback cycles:
- **Vampire Survivors**: See enemies → abilities auto-fire → experience drops → level up → choose upgrade → see more enemies (30 seconds)
- **DOOM**: See demon → aim → shoot → demon dies → find next demon (10 seconds)
- **Wordle**: Think word → type guess → see colored feedback → think new word (30 seconds)

Micro loops create flow state. When smooth, players lose track of time. When rough, every moment feels laborious. Micro loops answer: "What am I doing right now?"

**Meso Loops** (minutes to half hour) - Satisfying chunks of progress:
- **Hades**: Clear room → see reward options → choose path → defeat chamber → collect reward → reach next chamber (3-5 minutes)
- **Slay the Spire**: Enter combat → play cards → resolve fight → choose reward → modify deck → enter next combat (5-10 minutes)
- **Wordle**: Complete puzzle → share result → wait for tomorrow (1 minute of play, 24-hour wait)

Meso loops provide structural goals. Each completion feels like meaningful progress. Meso loops answer: "What am I working toward this session?"

**Macro Loops** (30 minutes to 4 hours) - Session-appropriate closure:
- **Hades**: Start run → progress through chambers → defeat boss or die → earn permanent rewards → upgrade relationships → start new run (30-45 minutes)
- **Civilization**: Start era → expand civilization → manage crises → reach next era (60-90 minutes)
- **Monster Hunter**: Accept quest → prepare loadout → hunt monster → carve materials → craft upgrades → return to hub (45-60 minutes)

Macro loops provide session closure. Players can stop satisfied even if the larger game isn't complete. Macro loops answer: "What did I accomplish today?"

**Meta Loops** (hours to campaigns) - Long-term investment and progression:
- **Dark Souls**: Explore area → die repeatedly to boss → learn patterns → defeat boss → unlock new area → face harder challenges (10-40 hours)
- **Balatro**: Complete run → unlock new jokers/decks → experiment with new strategies → attempt harder stakes (20-100 hours)
- **Disco Elysium**: Investigate case → uncover new leads → explore political/philosophical themes → resolve mysteries (20-30 hours)

Meta loops provide long-term purpose and keep players returning across sessions. Meta loops answer: "Why am I playing this game across days/weeks/months?"

### Loop Architecture Patterns

**Not all games need all four scales**. Your loop architecture should match your aesthetic and audience:

**Compressed Architecture** (1-2 scales) - Casual players, short sessions:
- **Wordle**: Meso only (one puzzle per day, no micro or macro loops)
- **Candy Crush**: Micro + Meso (swipe candies, complete level)
- Design for: 5-30 minute sessions, interruption-prone contexts

**Standard Architecture** (2-3 scales) - Midcore players, moderate sessions:
- **Hades**: Micro (combat) + Meso (chambers) + Macro (runs)
- **Slay the Spire**: Micro (card play) + Meso (combats) + Macro (runs) + Meta (unlocks)
- Design for: 30-90 minute sessions, dedicated but limited time

**Expansive Architecture** (3-4 scales) - Hardcore players, long campaigns:
- **Dark Souls**: Micro (combat) + Meso (exploration segments) + Macro (area completion) + Meta (full playthrough)
- **Civilization**: All four scales (turns, improvements, eras, full game)
- Design for: 2+ hour sessions, sustained engagement across weeks

**The Busy Adult Challenge**: Games like **God of War (2018)** and **The Witcher 3** attempt expansive content with busy adult constraints—they use aggressive session recaps and clear macro-loop closure points to make 30-minute sessions feel worthwhile within 40+ hour campaigns.

### How Loops Connect to Aesthetics and Investment

Different aesthetics require different loop architectures:

**Challenge** aesthetic needs tight micro loops for skill expression, meso loops for skill tests, and macro loops for earned achievements. **Dark Souls** excels here—micro (combat timing), meso (exploration segments), macro (boss defeats), meta (area progression).

**Discovery** aesthetic needs variety in micro loops (prevent repetition), meso loops with exploration rewards, macro loops with "aha!" moments. **Outer Wilds** provides pure Discovery through 22-minute macro loops that force new approaches each cycle.

**Fellowship** aesthetic needs simple micro loops (don't distract from social interaction), meso loops that create shared moments. **Among Us** keeps micro loops trivial (walk, do tasks) so players focus on social deduction in meso loops (discussion phases).

**Mastery** aesthetic needs consistent micro loops (pattern learning), complex meso loops (tactical decisions), and long meta loops (deep optimization). **Path of Exile** serves Mastery through build theory crafting across 100+ hour meta loops.

**Submission** aesthetic needs relaxing micro loops (gentle flow), optional meso structure (can zone out), minimal meta pressure. **Stardew Valley** allows pure micro-loop flow (water plants, talk to villagers) without forcing meso/macro goals.

**Investment capacity determines loop accessibility:**

**Casual players** (5-30 minute sessions):
- **Must have**: Satisfying meso loops (complete something per session)
- **Can't maintain**: Complex meta loops (mental models decay between sessions)
- **Example**: Wordle completes its full experience in one meso loop

**Midcore players** (30-90 minute sessions):  
- **Must have**: Complete macro loops (session closure)
- **Can maintain**: Meta loops with reminders (weekly gaps common)
- **Example**: Hades provides 30-45 minute macro loops (full runs) within meta progression

**Hardcore players** (2+ hour sessions):
- **Can maintain**: Complex meta loops across weeks
- **Seek**: All four loop scales for depth
- **Example**: Civilization uses all scales across 6+ hour sessions

### Loop-Scale Design Principles

**Micro loops must be fast**: Adjudication and feedback should be near-instant. **Vampire Survivors** processes hundreds of micro decisions per minute. **Red Dead Redemption 2** breaks flow with 8-second looting animations.

**Meso loops must be clear**: Players should always know their current goal and progress. **Hades** shows exact chamber count and reward previews. Early **No Man's Sky** failed here—players didn't know what meso goal they were pursuing.

**Macro loops must provide closure**: Players should feel satisfied stopping after macro completion. **Slay the Spire** guarantees complete runs (victory or defeat) with permanent unlocks. **Destiny 2** breaks this—incomplete bounties create obligation, not satisfaction.

**Meta loops must motivate return intrinsically**: Long-term goals should arise from curiosity, mastery drive, or narrative investment—not FOMO or time-gates. **Balatro** uses intrinsic motivation (want to try new strategies). **Daily login bonuses** use extrinsic pressure (obligation, not desire).

### Designing Your Loop Architecture

**Start with investment capacity**: Who are your players and what time can they commit?
- Casual (5-30 min) → Need satisfying meso loops, avoid complex meta
- Midcore (30-90 min) → Need complete macro loops, support meta with recaps
- Hardcore (2+ hours) → Can sustain all four scales

**Match to aesthetic goals**: What experience are you creating?
- Challenge → Tight micro (skill), earned macro (bosses), optional meta (mastery)
- Discovery → Varied micro (exploration), revealing meso (secrets), meta knowledge (recontextualization)
- Fellowship → Simple micro (social focus), shared meso (group moments), light meta (campaign arcs)
- Mastery → Consistent micro (learning), complex meso (tactics), deep meta (optimization)

**Ensure loop closure**: Each scale should complete satisfyingly:
- **Good**: Hades runs always conclude (death or victory) with permanent rewards
- **Bad**: Incomplete bounties in Destiny 2 create obligation to return
- **Good**: Wordle completes daily with sharable result
- **Bad**: Interrupted mid-quest in games without save-anywhere

**Design stopping points**: Match frequency to player capacity:
- Casual → Every 10-20 minutes (meso loop completion)
- Midcore → Every 30-60 minutes (macro loop completion)  
- Hardcore → Every 1-2 hours (major macro milestones)

**Support mental model persistence**: Help players resume after gaps:
- Session recaps (God of War 2018: "Last time, you were...")
- Quest logs and objective markers
- Environmental storytelling (visual cues about what you were doing)
- Tutorial reminders for returning players

### Common Loop Architecture Problems

**Loop interruption** breaks flow when systems force waiting during micro loops. **Red Dead Redemption 2** interrupts every looting action with 8-second animations. Realistic but flow-breaking.

**Loop confusion** occurs when players don't understand what they're working toward. **Death Stranding** has unclear meso loops initially—players spend hours unsure what constitutes progress.

**Loop exhaustion** happens when meta loops require repeating identical macro loops. **Destiny 2** asks players to run the same strikes weekly for marginal rewards. The structure works initially but becomes a chore.

**Loop-investment mismatch** occurs when loop architecture demands more investment than players can provide. Complex meta loops fail for casual players who can't maintain mental models across multi-day gaps.

**Loop-aesthetic mismatch** happens when temporal structure contradicts experiential goals. **SimCity (2013)** added always-online multiplayer requiring synchronous coordination—breaking the Submission/Expression aesthetic many players wanted.

**Missing closure** frustrates when players can't find satisfying stopping points. Games that lack macro-loop completion force players to stop mid-experience, creating obligation instead of satisfaction.

### The Temporal Architecture Chapter

This introduction to loops provides foundational understanding. **Temporal Architecture (Chapter 6)** goes deep:
- Detailed loop requirements for each aesthetic
- Investment trajectory patterns across scales
- Stopping point design framework  
- Hook mechanics that create intrinsic return motivation
- Complete operationalization process from aesthetic to buildable loops
- Validation protocols for testing temporal architecture

For now, understand: **loops are the temporal scaffolding that supports your aesthetic**. Get them wrong, and even perfect mechanics feel tedious. Get them right, and players lose themselves in your experience.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Loop architecture is fundamental to game design, validated across decades of practice. The 4-scale framework emerges from industry-standard temporal design patterns.
## System Functions: What Game Systems Do

Beyond their structural components, game systems perform specific functions—the actual work that enables play. Understanding these functions helps designers identify what their system needs to do, not just how it's built. 

**The critical insight:** Different loop scales require different functions. A function that's critical at micro scale might not be needed at meta scale, and vice versa. Temporal Architecture (Chapter 6) details exactly which functions operate at which scales.

### Function 1: Adjudication (Resolving Uncertainty)

Every game needs to answer "what happens?" when outcomes are uncertain. Without adjudication, play stalls or devolves into argument.

**Implementation Methods:**
- **Dice** provide transparent randomness. D&D's d20 makes every action a 5% increment—players understand the odds.
- **Algorithms** provide complex calculations. **XCOM** calculates hit percentages from cover, range, abilities, and modifiers instantly.
- **GM fiat** provides narrative flexibility. The GM decides what makes sense for the story.
- **Consensus** provides collaborative authority. **Microscope** (2011) has players collectively decide what happens in history.
- **Player skill** provides direct resolution. **Dark Souls** parry timing is adjudicated by physics, not dice.
- **LLMs** could provide natural language interpretation—describe your action in words, receive narratively appropriate outcome.

**Speed Requirements by Loop Scale:**
- **Micro loops**: Must be instant (sub-second). **Vampire Survivors** resolves 100+ adjudications per minute without breaking flow.
- **Meso loops**: Can be complex (seconds acceptable). **XCOM** tactical combat allows calculation time.
- **Macro/Meta loops**: Speed less critical. Campaign-level adjudication can take minutes.

**Aesthetic Matching:**
- **Challenge** needs consistency (same action, same result enables pattern learning)
- **Narrative** needs flexibility (dramatic moments matter more than rigid rules)
- **Fellowship** needs transparency (everyone understands why things happened)
- **Mastery** needs determinism (reduce randomness to highlight skill)

### Function 2: Information Management (Controlling Knowledge)

Games thrive on information asymmetry—what players know, don't know, and discover. Systems must manage what information exists, who knows it, when it's revealed, and what happens if it's missed.

**This is about strategic knowledge, not moment-to-moment feedback** (that's Function 5).

**Implementation Approaches:**
- **Gated information**: Classic **D&D** investigation rolls—fail and you don't find the clue. Risk of total stall.
- **Guaranteed core, gated details**: **Gumshoe** automatically provides essential clues, spends for extras. Never stalls.
- **Generated information**: **Apocalypse World** "Read a Situation" creates facts through play that didn't exist before rolling.
- **Perfect information**: **Into the Breach** shows all enemy actions next turn. No hidden knowledge, pure tactics.
- **Asymmetric information**: **Among Us** players have different knowledge (Impostor vs. Crewmates). Information itself is the game.

**Design Information as a Resource:**
- **When is it scarce?** Mystery games make information rare and precious
- **When is it abundant?** Discovery games reward exploration with information
- **How is it earned?** Through skill checks, exploration, social interaction, observation?
- **What does it cost?** Time, resources, risk, relationships?

**Aesthetic Matching:**
- **Discovery** aesthetic makes information the primary reward
- **Mystery** aesthetic makes information scarce and requires inference
- **Horror** aesthetic makes information unreliable and incomplete
- **Challenge** aesthetic often uses perfect information (skill-testing, not luck)

**Loop Scale Requirements:**
- **Meso loops**: CRITICAL—players must understand current goal ("what am I doing?")
- **Macro loops**: Important—help players resume after session gaps
- **Micro loops**: Less critical—clarity matters, but strategic info operates at larger scales

### Function 3: Content Generation (Creating Variety)

Without new content, games end when prepared material runs out. Systems need ways to create novel situations, encounters, locations, and challenges—whether for solo play, cooperative play, or competitive play.

**Implementation Strategies:**

**Pre-authored content:**
- **Strength**: High quality, coherent, authored voice
- **Weakness**: Finite—runs out after one playthrough
- **Example**: **Curse of Strahd** (2016) offers exceptional content for one campaign
- **When to use**: Single-playthrough games, narrative-focused experiences

**Procedural generation:**
- **Strength**: Infinite variety, replayability
- **Weakness**: Risk of incoherence, "sameness" despite variety
- **Example**: **No Man's Sky** generates infinite planets but they can feel repetitive
- **When to use**: Roguelikes, sandbox games, high-replayability designs

**Hybrid approaches:**
- **Random tables**: **Stars Without Number** combines authored elements into novel configurations
- **Remixing systems**: **Into the Breach** uses same missions with different terrain/enemy placements
- **Modular content**: **Slay the Spire** procedurally combines authored encounters

**Player-generated content:**
- **Players as co-authors**: **Fiasco** has players build scenarios from prompt cards
- **User-generated levels**: **Mario Maker**, **Dreams**
- **Emergent narratives**: **Dwarf Fortress** generates stories through simulation

**AI/LLM generation:**
- **Potential**: Coherent improvisation maintaining consistency
- **Challenge**: Avoiding generic "AI slop" while preserving authorial voice
- **Current best use**: Augmenting authored content, not replacing it

**Content Needs by Loop Scale:**
- **Micro loops**: Varies by aesthetic (Discovery needs variety, Challenge needs consistency)
- **Meso loops**: Need sufficient variety for 10-20 iterations per session without obvious repetition
- **Macro loops**: Single-playthrough can use entirely authored; replayable games need generation
- **Meta loops**: Replayability requires variety across many macro loops

**Note:** This function serves both solo and multiplayer games. The old "Procedural Content for Solo Play" was too narrow—procedural generation works everywhere.

### Function 4: State Persistence (Remembering Across Time)

Games need memory. Character growth, world changes, relationship evolution—these require the system to remember what happened and make it matter.

**Persistence Scopes:**

**Micro loops**: RAM only—state doesn't persist across sessions
**Meso loops**: Track progress within loop—autosaves, checkpoints within encounter
**Macro loops**: CRITICAL—must persist across sessions (save files, cloud saves)
**Meta loops**: CRITICAL—long-term progression tracking (account level, achievements)

**Implementation Methods:**
- **Character sheets** track mechanical state (level, HP, inventory, abilities)
- **Campaign logs** track narrative state (what happened, who you met, what you learned)
- **Faction systems** track world state (**Blades in the Dark** clocks remember organizational responses)
- **Save files** preserve everything (**Civilization** thousands of state variables)
- **Cloud saves** persist across devices and survive reinstalls
- **Platform achievements** track meta progression permanently

**Failure Modes:**
- **Progress loss**: **Anthem** disconnect bugs erased mission progress—destroyed player trust
- **Resume confusion**: Loading save from weeks ago with no idea what you were doing
- **Save bloat**: **Skyrim** remembers every moved cheese wheel, creating massive files
- **Narrative discontinuity**: NPCs repeat same dialogue despite world-changing events

**Design Considerations:**
- **Session gaps**: Weekly games use player memory; monthly games need extensive notes
- **Shared worlds**: **West Marches** campaigns distribute memory across players through wikis
- **Resume support**: Session recaps, quest logs, objective markers rebuild mental models

**Aesthetic Matching:**
- **Progression** aesthetic requires clear persistence of power growth
- **Narrative** aesthetic requires remembering story beats and relationship changes
- **Challenge** aesthetic may use permadeath (persistence creates stakes)

### Function 5: Feedback Systems (Confirming Actions)

Every action players take needs immediate confirmation that something happened. Feedback is distinct from information management—it's not about revealing strategic knowledge, it's about **communicating that the action registered and what the immediate result was**.

**This is critical for micro loops, where hundreds of actions happen per minute.**

**Feedback Channels:**

**Visual feedback:**
- Damage numbers appearing above enemies
- Health bars depleting or filling
- Visual state changes (enemy staggers, glows, explodes)
- Particle effects (sparks, blood, magic)
- UI updates (ammo count, resource increments)
- Screen effects (hit flash, damage vignette)

**Audio feedback:**
- Hit confirmation sounds (thunk, slash, impact)
- Miss sounds (whoosh, clang off armor)
- Success jingles (level up, achievement unlocked)
- Failure warnings (low health beep, alarm)
- Environmental response (glass breaking, wood splintering)

**Haptic feedback:**
- Controller rumble on impact
- VR haptic suits
- Adaptive trigger resistance (PS5)

**Timing Requirements:**
- **Micro loops**: Instant (sub-100ms)—delayed feedback breaks flow
- **Meso loops**: Immediate (sub-second)—players need to understand results to make next decision
- **Macro/Meta loops**: Timing less critical—can show cumulative results

**Good Feedback Example: Vampire Survivors**
- Hitbox collision → instant damage number → enemy flashes → experience orb drops
- Zero ambiguity, zero delay
- Can process 100+ feedback events per minute without confusion

**Bad Feedback Example: Red Dead Redemption 2**
- Looting requires 8-second animation to confirm action
- Player must wait for feedback to complete
- Flow-breaking at micro scale (though thematically appropriate)

**Aesthetic Matching:**
- **Challenge** needs clear feedback (understand why you failed)
- **Submission** may minimize feedback (stay in flow, don't break immersion)
- **Sensation** can emphasize feedback (satisfying impacts, visual flair)

**The Distinction from Information Management:**
- **Feedback**: "Your attack hit for 50 damage" (action confirmation)
- **Information Management**: "The dragon has 200 HP total" (strategic knowledge)

### Function 6: Cognitive Framing (Shaping How Players Think)

Systems don't just resolve actions—they shape how players think about problems. The system teaches players what matters, what's possible, and how to approach situations.

**This operates at multiple scales:**

**Micro loops: Action Language**
- Systems teach "what verbs exist" through repetition
- If attack always works → players learn "attacking is primary verb"
- If stealth rewards → players learn "avoid combat when possible"
- If resources scarce → players learn "conserve ammunition"

**Meso loops: Strategic Priorities**
- Players learn what actually matters through feedback
- Which resources are critical vs. noise
- Which build paths are viable
- Which tactical approaches work

**Meta loops: Player Identity**
- Long-term engagement shapes identity within community
- "I'm a Diamond Rocket League player" (ranking system)
- "I beat Dark Souls at SL1" (challenge achievements)
- "I have all the achievements" (completionist identity)

**Framing Through System Design:**

**Attributes define what matters**:
- D&D's six attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) say these are fundamental character traits
- **Honey Heist** has only two stats: CRIMINAL and BEAR. Tells you everything about the game.

**Actions define possibilities**:
- **Apocalypse World** moves name specific actions: "Go Aggro," "Seduce or Manipulate," "Read a Situation"
- Players think in terms of these moves
- **Lasers & Feelings** has only LASERS (technology/reason) and FEELINGS (intuition/passion)—every problem becomes one or the other

**Resources define values**:
- **Call of Cthulhu** tracks Sanity—establishes mental health matters and will be threatened
- **Blades in the Dark** tracks Stress—pushing yourself has psychological cost
- **Dread** uses Jenga tower—physical tension creates actual tension

**Creating Specific Mindsets:**
- Want players to think like alien minds? Create attributes that don't map to human concepts
- Want players to avoid violence? Make violent actions mechanically inferior to alternatives
- Want players to value relationships? Make social bonds mechanically powerful
- Want players to feel time pressure? Make everything cost time explicitly

**Aesthetic Matching:**
- **Mastery** aesthetic requires transparent framing (must understand systems deeply)
- **Narrative** aesthetic uses framing to guide player interpretation
- **Discovery** aesthetic can hide framing initially (learning the language is part of discovery)

### Functions and Loop Scales: Summary Table

| Function | Micro Loops | Meso Loops | Macro Loops | Meta Loops |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Adjudication** | CRITICAL (instant) | Important (complex OK) | Sometimes | Rarely needed |
| **Information Management** | Helpful | CRITICAL (goal clarity) | Important (resumption) | Sometimes |
| **Content Generation** | Varies by aesthetic | Often required | Depends on replayability | For replayability |
| **State Persistence** | RAM only | Progress tracking | CRITICAL (save files) | CRITICAL (long-term) |
| **Feedback Systems** | CRITICAL (immediate) | Important (clear results) | Less critical | Not needed |
| **Cognitive Framing** | Teaches actions | Teaches strategy | Sometimes | Shapes identity |

**The takeaway:** Not every function operates at every scale. Design functions appropriate to your loop architecture.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - System functions are observable across all games. This 6-function framework emerges from analyzing how systems actually operate at different temporal scales.

## How Components Create Dynamics

### The Emergence of Play

Dynamics are the behaviors that emerge when mechanics meet players. They're not designed directly—they arise from how components interact. You design mechanics and parameters, set context and pacing, ensure configuration coherence. Dynamics emerge from player interaction with this system.

### Mechanics + Parameters = Behavioral Patterns

Same mechanics with different parameters create entirely different dynamics:

**Rocket Jumping** emerged in **Quake** (1996). The mechanics: rockets have knockback, players have HP, explosion physics exist. The parameters: knockback is high, self-damage is manageable, maps have high places. The dynamic: players deliberately shoot rockets at their feet to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Id Software didn't design rocket jumping—players discovered it.

**Camping** emerges in battle royales. The mechanics: large map, shrinking circle, one life per match. The parameters: dying means waiting for next match, circle shrinks slowly, buildings provide cover. The dynamic: some players hide and avoid combat until forced. Developers didn't intend camping—it emerges from risk-averse play.

**Min-maxing** emerges in RPGs. The mechanics: character customization, statistical benefits, optimization possible. The parameters: some choices are mathematically superior, respecs are limited or costly. The dynamic: players sacrifice character concept for mechanical advantage. Designers create character options—players create spreadsheets.

### Context Transforms Meaning

Context changes how players interpret and approach identical mechanics:

**Permadeath** in **XCOM** creates attachment to soldiers. You name them after friends, mourn their loss, play cautiously to preserve them. **Permadeath** in **Rogue Legacy** (2013) creates humor. Your descendants have randomized genetic traits—one might be colorblind, another have IBS. Death is funny, not tragic.

**Collection** in **Pokémon** creates adventure. You're exploring the world, making friends with creatures. **Collection** in **Shin Megami Tensei** creates moral complexity. You're enslaving demons through negotiation or force. Same mechanic (creature collection), different context, different player behavior.

### Pacing Emerges from Parameters

Pacing isn't designed directly—it emerges from how quickly resources recover, how fast threats escalate, how long tasks take:

**Dark Souls** creates methodical pacing through:
- Slow healing animation (can't panic-heal)
- Limited healing items (conserve for bosses)
- Corpse runs (death has time cost)
- Checkpoint spacing (progress feels precious)

Nobody programmed "be methodical"—it emerges from parameters.

**DOOM Eternal** (2020) creates aggressive pacing through:
- Glory kills restore health (offense is defense)
- Chainsaw kills restore ammo (killing solves scarcity)
- Constant movement bonuses (standing still is death)
- Arena design (no safe spaces)

Nobody programmed "be aggressive"—it emerges from parameters.

### Configuration Coherence Creates Clear Dynamics

When all components pull in the same direction, dynamics become clear and satisfying:

**Hades** achieves configuration coherence:
- Mechanics: Tight combat with builds that emerge from boon combinations
- Parameters: Death resets runs but preserves meta-progression
- Context: Zagreus repeatedly escaping creates narrative justification for repetition
- Pacing: Each run takes 30-40 minutes—perfect session length
- Configuration: Everything serves "one more run" dynamic

Players naturally fall into the intended pattern: attempt escape, die, chat with NPCs, upgrade, attempt again. The dynamic feels inevitable because every component pushes toward it.

**Anthem** (2019) suffered configuration incoherence:
- Mechanics: Flying iron man suits suggests freedom
- Parameters: Constant tethering to teammates contradicts freedom
- Context: You're freelancer mercenary suggests independence
- Pacing: Long loading screens between every activity breaks flow
- Configuration: Components fight each other

Players felt the friction. The game wanted to be single-player power fantasy and multiplayer looter simultaneously. Components pulled in different directions, creating unsatisfying dynamics.

### Designing for Dynamics

You can't control dynamics directly, but you can shape them:

**Identify desired behavior**. What do you want players to do? Rush forward? Think carefully? Cooperate? Compete?

**Design components to encourage that behavior**. Want rushing? Make resources regenerate quickly, make standing still dangerous. Want thinking? Make resources scarce, make mistakes costly.

**Test whether dynamics emerge**. Players will surprise you. They'll find strategies you didn't anticipate, exploit systems you thought were balanced, avoid content you thought was mandatory.

**Adjust components, not dynamics**. You can't patch player behavior directly. You change mechanics, tune parameters, clarify context, adjust pacing. The dynamics shift in response.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - The relationship between components and dynamics is fundamental to all system design.

## Reading the Rest of This Book

### The Journey Ahead

This chapter established the foundation—what game systems are, what they're made of, what they do. The remaining chapters explore how to build on this foundation, each tackling a crucial aspect of game design.

### Chapter 2: Resource Management

Resources are the currencies that create meaningful choices. HP, gold, ammunition, time, attention—these create scarcity that forces prioritization.

You'll learn:
- Five resource types (Consumable, Buffer, Accumulation, Composition, Capacity)
- How recovery patterns determine pacing
- Psychological effects of ownership, scarcity, and loss
- How to match resources to aesthetics
- Common resource anti-patterns to avoid

This chapter builds on the Components framework, showing how Parameters (scarcity levels, recovery rates) create different dynamics from the same resource Mechanics.

### Chapter 3: Cognitive Load and Game System Design

Every game demands mental effort. Tracking resources, evaluating options, remembering rules, recognizing patterns—these create cognitive load that shapes who can play and how they experience your game.

You'll learn:
- Seven types of cognitive load (Simultaneity, Decision, Memory, Tracking, Calculation, Pattern Recognition, Social)
- How different aesthetics require different load profiles
- Load as design constraint, not resource
- Supporting necessary load vs. removing unnecessary load
- How player expertise changes load over time

This chapter connects to every other aspect of design—resources create tracking load, balance must be perceivable despite load, context affects memory load, pacing must account for cognitive fatigue.

### Chapter 4: From Principles to Numbers (Balance)

Balance isn't about making everything equal—it's about creating appropriate challenge for your chosen aesthetic. Different aesthetics need different balance paradigms.

You'll learn:
- Three balance paradigms (Framework, Consistency, Adaptive)
- How to match paradigm to aesthetic
- Concrete balancing formulas and measurables
- Why balance must be perceivable, not just mathematical
- Playtesting protocols for validation

This chapter synthesizes previous concepts, showing how Components must be configured coherently, how cognitive load affects perceived balance, and how resources create the levers for balancing.

### Chapter 5: Context - From Setting to Experience

Context transforms abstract mechanics into meaningful experiences. Genre determines required dynamics. Dressing provides aesthetic wrapper. Perspective maintains emotional tone.

You'll learn:
- Genre vs. dressing distinction
- How context shapes player behavior
- Build/Suggest/Omit framework for worldbuilding
- Perspective coherence across all elements
- How the same mechanics create different games through context

This chapter reveals how Context (Component 3) isn't just flavor—it fundamentally shapes how players approach your game, what dynamics emerge, and whether your scaffold achieves its purpose.

### Chapter 6: Temporal Architecture

Loop architecture is how your game unfolds across time—from second-to-second actions to session-to-session progression. Different aesthetics and player investment levels require different temporal structures.

You'll learn:
- Four loop scales (micro, meso, macro, meta) and when each is needed
- Loop architecture patterns (compressed, standard, expansive)
- Investment trajectories (how cognitive load changes across scales)
- Stopping point design (creating satisfying session closure)
- Hook mechanics (intrinsic motivation for return)
- Operationalizing loops (from architecture decisions to buildable systems)

This chapter provides the temporal dimension missing from earlier frameworks. Resources need recovery patterns (temporal). Cognitive load must account for session gaps (temporal). Balance requires appropriate loop durations (temporal). Context must persist across sessions (temporal).

### Chapter 7: Synthesis (Planned)

The book concludes with complete worked examples, showing all frameworks operating together:
- Full game designs from aesthetic to implementation
- Diagnostic tools for when games aren't working
- Integration patterns for LLM augmentation
- Validation protocols for testing experiential scaffolds

### How to Use This Book

**If you're designing a new game**: Read chapters in order. Each builds on the previous, giving you tools to construct your experiential scaffold systematically.

**If you're fixing an existing game**: Jump to the relevant chapter. Game feels tedious? Check temporal architecture in Chapter 6. Players confused? Check cognitive load in Chapter 3. Mechanics feel meaningless? Check context in Chapter 5. Numbers feel wrong? Check balance in Chapter 4.

**If you're analyzing games**: Use the frameworks as lenses. What aesthetic does this serve? What functions does it perform? What cognitive load does it create? How are its resources balanced? What loop architecture does it use?

**If you're integrating LLMs**: Pay special attention to System Functions (this chapter) and Information Management (Chapter 2). LLMs excel at some functions, fail at others. Design accordingly.

## Chapter Summary

### Key Principles

**Games are experiential scaffolds**. They're not about mechanics—they're about the experiences those mechanics enable. The scaffold exists to support the experience.

**Design from purpose**. Start with your intended aesthetic, then design components to achieve it. Don't start with cool mechanics and hope they create something meaningful.

**Configuration coherence matters**. All five components (Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing, Configuration) must serve the same aesthetic. Incoherence creates friction players feel even if they can't articulate it.

**Dynamics emerge**. You don't design player behavior directly—you design components that encourage certain dynamics. Players will surprise you.

**Systems perform functions**. Beyond their structure, systems do work at different loop scales: adjudicate outcomes, manage information, generate content, persist state, provide feedback, and frame cognition. Different aesthetics and loop scales require different functions.

**Temporal architecture shapes engagement**. Games operate at four loop scales (micro, meso, macro, meta). Not all games need all scales—match loop architecture to aesthetic goals and player investment capacity. Compressed architecture (1-2 scales) for casual players, expansive architecture (3-4 scales) for hardcore players.

### The Aesthetic-First Design Process

1. **Choose your primary aesthetic**. What experience do you want players to have? Use the common aesthetics as starting points, but define your own if you need more precision.

2. **Identify required functions**. What work must your system perform at each loop scale? Micro loops need instant adjudication and feedback. Meso loops need clear information management. Macro loops need state persistence. Match functions to your loop architecture.

3. **Design components coherently**. Create mechanics that serve your aesthetic. Set parameters that encourage desired dynamics. Choose context that reinforces meaning. Tune pacing through parameters. Ensure configuration coherence.

4. **Design loop architecture**. Choose which loop scales your game needs based on aesthetic and player capacity. Design micro loops for flow, meso loops for progress structure, macro loops for session closure, meta loops for long-term purpose. Not all games need all four scales.

5. **Manage cognitive load deliberately**. Know what mental effort your game demands. Support necessary load, remove unnecessary load. Match load profile to aesthetic.

6. **Test whether scaffold achieves purpose**. Do players experience your intended aesthetic? If not, identify which component or function is failing. Adjust and test again.

### What's Next

Chapter 2 explores resources in depth—the currencies and constraints that create meaningful decisions. You'll learn how different resource types serve different aesthetics, how recovery patterns shape pacing, and how to design resource systems that support your experiential scaffold.

The journey from concept to playable game requires many decisions. This framework ensures those decisions align toward a coherent purpose: creating the experience you intended, supported by systems that make it possible.

The scaffold is not the destination. It's what makes the journey possible.

**Confidence Level for Chapter Overall**: HIGH for established concepts (MDA, components, functions), MEDIUM for our extensions (four additional aesthetics, specific categorizations), LOW for untested integrations (LLM functions, some dynamic predictions).
