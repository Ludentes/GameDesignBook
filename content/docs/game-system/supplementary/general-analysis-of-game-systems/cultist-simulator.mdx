# Cultist Simulator: When Obscurity Becomes the System

Cultist Simulator fundamentally reimagines what a game system can be by making discovery of the rules itself the primary gameplay loop. Designer Alexis Kennedy created a card-based resource management game where **understanding how the game works IS the game**, deliberately withholding tutorials and explicit guidance to create what he calls "the experience of learning magic if magic really existed—a nest of mysteries and a series of 'aha!' moments." This radical design philosophy produced a commercially successful experiment that earned **double BAFTA nominations** while generating polarized reactions: 73% positive Steam reviews with players either praising its mysterious brilliance or condemning its impenetrability. The game challenges fundamental assumptions about transparency in game design, offering crucial lessons for understanding the spectrum between opaque and transparent systems.

The game's significance extends beyond its commercial success (100,000+ copies sold, breaking even in the first week on a £142k budget). Kennedy turned a personal design weakness—his admitted inability to create elegant tutorials—into a feature, proving that **respecting player intelligence** through intentional obscurity could work for certain audiences. The 2020 Exile DLC later shattered and rebuilt these mechanics entirely, creating what amounts to a second game that inverted the base game's resource economy while maintaining its mysterious core. Together, they represent a complete exploration of how mystery, narrative, and mechanics can fuse into unified systems.

## The card-based verb system: Making abstract tangible

Cultist Simulator operates on a dual system of **Cards** (nouns representing every game element) and **Verbs** (action boxes where cards are placed). Every resource, character, location, concept, and threat exists as a manipulable card on a virtual tabletop. Cards have **aspects**—mystical attributes like Lantern, Forge, Edge, Winter, Heart, Grail, Moth, Knock, and Secret Histories—that determine where and how they can be used.

The base game provides six permanent verbs that define all possible actions. **Work** generates income by holding jobs, creates art from Passion, or performs occult rituals. **Study** reads books into Lore fragments, combines knowledge, upgrades attributes, or decodes languages. **Dream** restores exhausted attributes, explores the Mansus (dream world), or counters threats like Dread. **Explore** mounts expeditions to vaults, shops at bookstores, or investigates city locations. **Talk** recruits followers, founds cults, assigns followers to tasks, or eliminates threats. Finally, **Time Passes** runs automatically every 60 seconds, consuming one Funds card—if you have no money, it triggers Starvation that devours your Health and leads to death.

This verb-card interaction creates the core gameplay loop: dragging cards onto verb tiles initiates 30-60 second timers. While timers run, players manage other actions, creating a **constant state of pleasant anticipation** as Kennedy described it. The system supports dozens of simultaneous timers without visual clutter, each representing a different thread of occult research, mundane survival, or existential threat. The brilliant design choice of the card metaphor makes inherently abstract concepts—despair, fascination, occult knowledge, social connections—into concrete, manipulable objects.

Kennedy chose cards for both practical and philosophical reasons. Cards are **fundamentally disposable** objects that players instinctively understand can be moved, combined, and destroyed. The tabletop aesthetic creates appropriate psychological distance—as co-designer Lottie Bevan noted, it evokes "being in a dark room moving cards around," perfectly capturing the isolated, obsessive nature of occult study. The low production costs (minimal animation required) allowed a two-person team to create a complex system on a tiny budget, proving that constraints can drive innovation.

## Resource scarcity through competing demands

The resource economy creates gameplay through **simultaneous, competing pressures** that make every decision meaningful. At the most basic layer sit the survival resources: **Health** (physical vitality, running out means death), **Funds** (money consumed every 60 seconds by Time Passes), **Passion** (creative energy for art and recruiting), and **Reason** (intellectual capability for jobs and study). These feed into secondary resources like Vitality (created by studying Health, converts 2:1 back), Glimmering and Erudition (upgraded Passion and Reason), and Contentment (positive emotional state that counters deadly Dread).

The negative resource layer creates cascading threats. **Dread** accumulates toward death—three Dread cards trigger a 60-second countdown to the "Consumed by Despair" ending. **Fascination** similarly leads to madness. **Afflictions** convert Health into disease states that become permanent if untreated. **Notoriety** attracts investigators who gather Evidence, potentially leading to imprisonment. Each threat has unique counters: Contentment neutralizes Dread, but Contentment itself only lasts 60 seconds before expiring.

Knowledge resources form the progression layer. **Lore fragments** range from level 2 to level 14 across ten different occult traditions. Players must combine matching Lore to advance levels, triggering "Challenges" that require specific resources. The subversion wheel allows one-way transformations—Moth converts to Lantern converts to Forge converts to Edge converts to Winter converts to Heart converts to Grail converts back to Moth, while Knock masters all types. This creates strategic depth: should you preserve specialized knowledge or convert it to what you need right now?

The human resources layer introduces **Followers**—Acquaintances recruited into Believers (2 aspect points), promoted to Disciples (5 points), then Exalted (10 points). Each promotion requires matching cult aspect combinations and takes 60 seconds. Followers can perform "cult business" like removing Evidence, killing Hunters, or earning Funds, but they're also vulnerable: expeditions can kill them permanently, and you might sacrifice them in rituals. **Summoned entities** provide powerful aspects (12+ points) but carry 30% rebellion risk—ignore rebellion and they permanently consume an attribute or eat a follower.

What creates decision-making pressure is how these systems interlock. The **Time Passes drain** demands constant income, forcing you to work jobs that lock your Health or Reason for 40-60 seconds. But advancement requires using those same attributes to Study books or Dream in the Mansus. Every action has opportunity cost. The **magnet system** compounds this: certain events automatically pull specific cards from your table—you can't simply wait out problems. The Season of Despair magnet pulls Dread or Contentment cards; if it accumulates three Dread, you have 60 seconds to live. Magnets activate instantly, even grabbing cards mid-action if not properly committed, forcing constant vigilance.

The timer system creates urgency through decay. Most Influences (crucial for rituals and promotions) last only 60 seconds. Restlessness decays to Dread in 60 seconds. Summoned entities have 60-180 seconds before rebellion. Jobs can expire. The game runs in **real-time with pause**, meaning player attention itself becomes a scarce resource—cards can be hidden off-screen, magnets can pull cards while you're distracted, and missing critical moments causes permanent losses.

Victory requires accumulating **36+ aspect points** across multiple resource types: a level 6 Desire, a 12-point Summon matching your cult aspect, level 10-14 Lore, and a level 15 Influence from deep Mansus exploration. Holding all these simultaneously is extraordinarily difficult because summons decay and influences last only 60 seconds. You must time everything perfectly while still working for Funds every minute to avoid starvation. This creates the fundamental tension: **you need time to progress, but time is trying to kill you**.

## Discovery as game design: Kennedy's philosophy

Alexis Kennedy's design philosophy centers on what he calls **respecting player intelligence**. In multiple interviews, he expressed frustration with games that "spoon-feed players," arguing: "There's an audience out there that enjoys mystery and intricacy." He deliberately made obscurity a feature to work with his own admitted weaknesses: "I'd never been good at elegance, I'd never been good at entry ramps, I'd never been good at tutorials. I reckoned that if I could make obscurity a feature, not a bug, it'd mesh better with my natural instincts."

The central design goal was creating the experience of "learning magic if magic really existed." Kennedy wanted players to feel like occult students discovering forbidden knowledge through experimentation and revelation rather than instruction. This meant no traditional tutorial, no comprehensive manual, minimal tooltips, and deliberately hidden mechanics. Success probabilities, optimal strategies, and card interactions remain obscured, forcing experimentation.

But Kennedy learned that **pure opacity is unplayable**. Early versions were so impenetrable that playtesters quit in frustration. The breakthrough came through what he calls **breadcrumbs**—a multi-layered hint system that creates "conversation between the game and the player." Narrative breadcrumbs appear in flavor text with recurring patterns and motifs. Mechanical breadcrumbs emerge through consistent rules players intuitively sense. UI breadcrumbs provide contextual hints when players are close to solutions, nudging without instructing.

The game teaches through **pattern recognition and failure**. Each interaction provides pithy, enigmatic text that serves three purposes: immediate reward (engaging but brief), story fragments (building larger narrative), and mechanical clues (trails of breadcrumbs). The opening message frames expectations: "Explore. Take risks. You won't always know what to do next. Keep experimenting, and you'll master it." The legacy system allows new games with advantages from previous runs, making each death a learning opportunity.

Kennedy's approach represents an evolution from his previous work. **Fallen London** (2009-2016) was a text-based browser game with "tight choices"—one choice at a time, linear progression. Players worried mechanics were "too complex," but Kennedy "kept the complexities." **Sunless Sea** (2015) combined survival mechanics with narrative but suffered from separation: sailing gameplay would stop for story overlays. Kennedy's "driving interest" was unifying narrative and mechanics so they become inseparable.

Cultist Simulator achieves this unification. Cards aren't just mechanical resources—they're story elements. The Work verb isn't just an income generator; it represents the mundane grind that occludes mystical pursuits. The timer pressure mirrors the cultist's race against mortality. Resource depletion becomes narrative: losing Health to Time isn't losing hit points, it's days passing as you neglect your body for esoteric study.

This design is deliberately autobiographical. Kennedy was a solo freelancer when creating Cultist Simulator, struggling to balance "actual paying work" with his "passion project." He channeled this directly into mechanics: "If you're ever playing Cultist Simulator and you resent having to defer a foray into the occult because you need to get that Work token generating funds…that's how I felt." The game's fundamental tension between survival and passion is the **indie developer's struggle** made playable.

## Exile: Inverting the survival equation

The Exile DLC (May 2020) represents a radical reconstruction rather than an expansion. Weather Factory describes it as "almost as big as Cultist Simulator was at launch" and something that "shatters and remakes all the rules you knew." It's effectively a second game built on the same engine, addressing community requests while exploring opposite design space.

Set in 1920s Europe, players assume the role of a former reckoner mob member—occult gangsters who traffic in stolen years of life. After betraying your reckoner lord, you flee across **33 cities** in Europe, Asia, and North Africa with **77 stolen years** and nothing else, constantly pursued. The base game's question was "How do you accumulate power while staying hidden?" Exile inverts this: "You have immense wealth but constant danger—how do you spend it safely while staying ahead?"

The mechanics reflect this inversion fundamentally. The base game gave infinite time with scarce resources; Exile provides **finite time** (77 years that cannot be replenished) with abundant resources. The base game rewarded sustainable resource generation; Exile forces **strategic expenditure** of irreplaceable assets. The base game let you prepare carefully; Exile demands improvisation through push-your-luck mechanics. Kennedy drew inspiration from *Ozark*, creating a survival thriller instead of a mystery discovery game.

The **Traces and Pursuit system** becomes Exile's defining mechanic. Most actions risk generating Traces (Reconnoitre has a 30% chance), and Traces attract escalating reckoner pursuers: Informants (can't be killed, create more Traces), Assassins (wound you; 7 wounds means death), Operatives (steal items permanently), Underbosses (combination threats requiring 4 wounds to kill), and finally The Foe (your former boss, extremely dangerous). This creates the **most controversial design element**—the 30% Trace chance on essential exploration actions felt punishing to many players, leading to the first player-created mod reducing Trace generation.

Exile completely replaces the base game's verb system. **Employ** hires temporary allies and assigns tasks. **Travel** moves between cities permanently—you cannot return to previous locations except through special mechanics. **Reconnoitre** explores the current city's deck to find Opportunities, Connections, Assets (properties you can purchase), and threats. **Relinquish** manages Traces and unwanted items. **Communicate** handles social interactions. Gone are Work, Study, Talk, Explore, and Dream; gone are Health, Passion, Reason management; gone are Dread, Fascination, Suspicion, Evidence, Notoriety, and the entire cult-building system.

The lore system becomes radically simplified. Instead of combining dozens of Lore fragments, you have **a single Edge fragment** that upgrades via Shrines or Reckoner Corpses (up to Edge 14), downgrades via Misty Nooks (providing Obscurity), and can be consecrated to The Lionsmith (adds Heart/Forge) or The Colonel (adds Winter/Lantern). This creates an upgradeable skill rather than a collection mechanic. At maximum level, it creates unique weapons. The fragment recharges from exhaustion faster at higher levels.

Victory conditions multiply to **10 different endings** across several types. **Obscurity victories** require accumulating 7 Obscurity to disappear from the reckoner world, with ending quality depending on Comfort (items and security). **Defiance victories** take an Edge-focused confrontational path. Alternative victories include Cunning, Patience, and Agony routes. Crucially, Exile finally delivers the **Edge Ascension** path the community had "long hungered for."

Player reception split dramatically. The Steam rating of **74% positive** (versus base game's 82%) reflects genuine division. Supporters praised the "magnificent nightmare" quality, faster pace, roguelike intensity, and successful execution of the "being on the run" fantasy. One reviewer wrote: "I constantly felt the enormous pressure of having to decide whether to cut and run or pursue opportunities." Critics missed the contemplative discovery and lore richness, finding it "ridiculously RNG based," with nothing "connected in a meaningful way." The 30% Trace chance on Reconnoitre generated particular frustration, with players reporting feeling "stuck."

What Exile addressed from base game criticisms: **repetitive late-game grinding** (finite resources prevent settling into safe routines), **lack of Edge Ascension** (delivered multiple Edge paths), **tame immortal enemies** (reckoners create genuine threat escalation), and **DLC integration difficulties** (sidestepped by being completely separate). What it created as new problems: **reduced player agency** through heavy RNG, **loss of narrative discovery focus** that made the base game special, **steep learning curve** requiring unlearning all base strategies, and **less satisfying** for those who loved cult-building depth.

Advanced Exile players developed a key insight: **"Both Sustain and Safety are impossible. For most of the game, don't bother."** This captures the philosophical shift—Exile rejects the base game's careful accumulation in favor of controlled chaos. It's approximately **70% mechanical overhaul, 30% content additions**, proving Weather Factory's willingness to radically experiment rather than deliver safe, incremental expansions.

## Cultist Simulator in the system design spectrum

Cultist Simulator occupies a unique position in game design theory as an **intentionally opaque system** where information asymmetry is the core feature. Most modern games fall on a transparency spectrum: **Civilization** and **XCOM** display all modifiers and hit percentages; **Into the Breach** provides perfect information for puzzle-like tactics; **Guild Wars** makes damage calculations transparent. Kennedy placed Cultist Simulator at the opposite extreme, joining **Dark Souls** (minimal system explanation) and **Candy Box!** (mystery-driven progression) in actively withholding information.

This positions it radically differently from traditional game systems the user mentioned. **D\&D** and traditional RPGs assume transparent rules—players know their abilities and make informed tactical choices. The challenge comes from applying known mechanics cleverly, not discovering what the rules are. **Powered by the Apocalypse** games make mechanics even more transparent with "moves" that explicitly state their effects, triggered by fiction in collaborative world-building. **FATE**'s flexible aspect system empowers players to shape narrative through visible mechanics.

In contrast, Cultist Simulator **disempowers** players deliberately. You don't know success probabilities, optimal strategies remain hidden, and experimentation costs resources. The challenge IS discovering the rules. As Kennedy stated: "Part of the game was working out how the game worked." This creates what TTRPG designer Mailanka calls an **"occulted system"**—where "they explain nothing to you. You have to experiment... There are systems that underly things that tend to have a surprising number of moving parts."

Compared to **Civilization**, the inversion is striking. Civ's appeal is optimization through transparent information—you see every modifier, plan multiple turns ahead, and execute strategies based on known formulas. Cultist Simulator deliberately prevents optimization by hiding those formulas. Both involve long-term planning, tech trees, and resource management, but Civ wants you to feel like a strategic commander while CS wants you to feel like an occult researcher stumbling through darkness.

The comparison to **XCOM** reveals similar contrasts. XCOM displays hit percentages so players can assess risk rationally—the challenge is execution and adaptation. Cultist Simulator hides probabilities so players must develop intuition through trial and error—the challenge is discovery. XCOM says "Commander, the choice is yours" with full information; CS says "Figure out the choice yourself."

What makes Cultist Simulator's approach to resource management unique is the **fusion of mechanical and narrative weight**. Every resource serves both systems and story. Dread isn't just a number threatening game over; it represents your character's psychological state, made tangible as a manipulable card. This differs from traditional resource management games where resources are often abstractions (gold, food, production). Kennedy's design makes abstract concepts (despair, fascination, occult knowledge) into concrete objects through the card metaphor.

The game teaches crucial lessons about **when opacity works** in system design. Successful opaque systems require: **Discovery as core appeal** (learning secrets is rewarding), **thematic alignment** (mystery fits the subject matter), **sufficient feedback** (players get enough information to learn), **low-stakes experimentation** (failure doesn't feel wasted), and **roguelike structure** (knowledge transfers between runs). Cultist Simulator succeeds on all counts—uncovering occult mysteries thematically justifies opacity, the breadcrumb system provides cryptic feedback, and the legacy system makes death educational.

But Kennedy's postmortem revealed opacity's costs. The game was "designed to be a niche game" but hit mainstream success, causing a **reviews problem** when players expecting traditional onboarding encountered experimental design. The steep learning curve and UI frustrations led many to bounce off. Kennedy concluded: "Those 'aha!' moments are most exciting when the game has seemed opaque and the player has felt confused. But confused players lose patience very quickly." Finding the balance between mystery and impenetrability required extensive playtesting and post-launch UI improvements.

The game's commercial success—100,000+ copies on a £142k budget, double BAFTA nominations, Develop:Star Awards for Best Game Design and Innovation—validated Kennedy's bet that "there's an audience out there that enjoys mystery and intricacy." But the **73% positive** Steam rating (versus competitors with 85-95%) shows the cost: deliberately niche design alienates players even as it deeply satisfies its target audience.

## Design lessons: Respect, constraint, and unity

Cultist Simulator teaches that **constraints enable creativity** in system design. The £142k budget and two-person team forced minimalist solutions—the card interface became the game's signature despite (because of) being born from necessity. Kennedy's inability to create elegant tutorials became a design strength when he made discovery the gameplay. This proves that limitations can drive innovation more effectively than abundant resources.

The central lesson is about **respecting player intelligence**. Kennedy demonstrated that audiences exist for complex, unguided experiences that trust players to figure things out. But respect doesn't mean abandonment—the breadcrumb system, contextual UI hints, and post-launch improvements show that guidance can coexist with mystery when done subtly. The balance is creating **conversation between game and player** rather than instruction manual or total silence.

The game validates **mechanics reinforcing theme** as fundamental to system design. Every element serves the narrative: the timer pressure mirrors mortality, the Work/passion tension reflects freelance struggle, the card abstraction creates psychological distance. When asked what makes indie games great, Kennedy said: "That it knows what it's doing, focuses on it, and does it well." Cultist Simulator ruthlessly serves its core experience—discovery of occult mysteries—even when that means violating conventional wisdom about accessibility.

The **narrative-mechanical fusion** Kennedy achieved sets a benchmark. Unlike games where story appears as overlay on separate mechanics (his critique of Sunless Sea), Cultist Simulator makes the systems and narrative inseparable. Resource management becomes character development. Gameplay embodies story. This unification represents what Kennedy calls his "driving interest"—making what you do and what happens narratively identical.

The Exile DLC teaches an additional lesson: **experimental iteration** can mean rebuilding rather than extending. Rather than integrate new systems with increasingly complex base mechanics, Weather Factory "blew up all the rules" to explore opposite design space. This willingness to risk alienating existing fans for design purity exemplifies indie game philosophy: "risky, interesting games that big studios would never touch."

Finally, Cultist Simulator demonstrates that **niche excellence beats mass mediocrity**. It's better to deeply satisfy a specific audience than mildly please everyone. The game's polarized reception—players either love its mysterious brilliance or hate its impenetrability—reflects successful targeting rather than design failure. Kennedy knew his audience and served them ruthlessly, accepting that others would bounce off.

## Conclusion: Mystery as system

Cultist Simulator fundamentally reimagines what game systems can be by making **discovery of the rules the primary gameplay**. Where D\&D and XCOM assume players want informed tactical decisions, where Civilization and FATE empower through transparent information, Cultist Simulator deliberately disempowers to create isolation and uncertainty. This isn't laziness or poor design—it's a calculated bet that some audiences want to struggle through darkness toward revelation.

The game succeeds as both commercial product and design statement. It proved that intentionally niche, experimentally opaque games can thrive financially while advancing the conversation about what games can do. Kennedy's philosophy—respecting player intelligence through challenging mysteries—validated an underserved audience hungry for games that don't spoon-feed answers.

But the struggles reveal opacity's real costs: bounced players, mixed reviews, accessibility concerns, and the constant risk of crossing from "pleasantly mysterious" to "frustratingly impenetrable." The breadcrumb system, UI improvements, and post-launch updates show that even radical experiments require compromise without abandoning vision.

The Exile DLC extends this lesson by proving that established systems can be completely rebuilt rather than incrementally extended. By inverting the base game's resource economy while maintaining its mysterious core, Weather Factory demonstrated commitment to experimentation over safe iteration. The divisive reception reflects genuine design achievement—it delivers exactly what it promises, even when that's not what everyone wants.

For game system designers, Cultist Simulator poses a fundamental question: What is your game really about, and are you willing to design systems that truly serve that, even if it means fewer players will understand? Kennedy answered emphatically: **mystery, discovery, and respect for intelligence** matter more than accessibility or market size. The card-based abstraction, real-time pressure, resource scarcity, and deliberate opacity all ruthlessly serve the core experience of uncovering forbidden knowledge.

The ultimate insight is that game systems exist on a spectrum from transparent to opaque, and the right choice depends entirely on what experience you're creating. Cultist Simulator proves that the far end of opacity can work brilliantly—when thematically justified, carefully balanced with subtle guidance, and targeted at the right audience. It's not a universal model, but a vital counter-example showing that alternatives to tutorial-driven design not only exist but can thrive.

As Kennedy said: "I think there's room for more games to respect the intelligence of the audience." Cultist Simulator proves him right while showing exactly how hard it is to get that respect right.
