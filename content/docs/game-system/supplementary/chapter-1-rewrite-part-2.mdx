## Section 3: The Five Components

Every game system, from the simplest card game to the most complex simulation, consists of five interlocking components. Change any one, and you change the experience. Understanding these components provides a practical framework for both analyzing existing systems and designing new ones.

### Component 1: Mechanics (What You Can Do)

Mechanics are the verbs of your game—the actions players can take and how the system resolves them. These include resolution systems (dice, cards, algorithms), action spaces (what choices exist), and resource interactions (what you can spend, trade, or transform).

**Resolution Systems** determine outcomes. **D\&D** uses d20 + modifier vs. difficulty class—transparent and swingy. **Powered by the Apocalypse** uses 2d6 + stat with three outcome tiers (10+ success, 7-9 mixed, 6- complication)—predictable bell curve with guaranteed forward movement. **Into the Breach** (2018) uses perfect information—no randomness, pure tactical calculation.

**Action Spaces** define possibilities. In **Chess**, you can only move pieces according to fixed patterns. In **Divinity: Original Sin 2** (2017), you can attack, cast spells, use items, manipulate environment, combine elements, talk, sneak, teleport—vast possibility space. In **Wordle** (2022), you can only guess five-letter words—extremely constrained but perfectly suited to its purpose.

The best mechanics fade into the background. Players think about what they want to do, not how the system works. **Advantage/disadvantage in D\&D 5e** replaced complex modifier stacking—roll twice, take the better/worse result. Simple, intuitive, faster than adding numbers.

### Component 2: Parameters (How Much, How Fast, How Scarce)

Parameters are the numbers and constraints that determine feel. Same mechanics with different parameters create completely different experiences. This is Weather Factory's secret—identical card-and-timer mechanics become frantic horror or meditative exploration through parameter changes.

**Scarcity** shapes decisions. In **XCOM 2**, soldiers are precious—losing one hurts. In **Total War**, soldiers are expendable—thousands die per battle. In **Fire Emblem**, fallen units stay dead (permanent loss). In **Advance Wars**, units are completely replaceable (currency loss). Same mechanic (unit combat), different scarcity, different experience.

**Speed** creates pressure. **StarCraft** (1998) measures actions-per-minute—speed is skill. **Civilization VI** (2016) has no time pressure—contemplation is encouraged. **FTL: Faster Than Light** (2012) lets you pause anytime—tactical planning under narrative pressure.

**Recovery** determines pacing. **Modern shooters** regenerate health in seconds—aggressive play rewarded. **Classic Resident Evil** requires finding herbs—conservative play rewarded. **Darkest Dungeon** (2016) makes stress persist between missions—consequences accumulate. **Hades** (2020) fully resets each run—failure is temporary.

Parameters do heavy lifting without adding complexity. You don't need new mechanics for horror—just make resources scarce, recovery slow, and threats lethal.

### Component 3: Context (What It Means)

Context transforms abstract mechanics into meaningful experiences. Rolling dice becomes sword fighting, card play becomes occult research, moving tokens becomes commanding armies. Context isn't just aesthetic window dressing—it fundamentally shapes how players approach the game.

**Setting** provides fictional framework. **Pandemic** (2008) and **Forbidden Island** (2010) have nearly identical mechanics—collect sets of cards to remove threats from a map. But Pandemic feels urgent (diseases spreading) while Forbidden Island feels adventurous (treasure hunting). The mechanics didn't change—the meaning did.

**Tone** affects decision-making. **This War of Mine** (2014) and **Fallout Shelter** (2015) both involve post-apocalyptic resource management. But This War of Mine's serious tone makes stealing medicine from elderly couples feel weighty, while Fallout Shelter's cartoonish tone makes sending dwellers to their doom feel lighthearted.

**Victory Conditions** define purpose. In **Twilight Imperium** (2017), victory comes from completing objectives—encouraging diverse strategies. In **Risk**, victory requires total domination—encouraging aggression. In **Spirit Island** (2017), victory means driving out invaders—encouraging defensive play.

Context must align with mechanics. **Call of Cthulhu** investigators who solve problems by punching monsters breaks the horror context. The mechanics (fragile investigators, sanity loss, overwhelming enemies) reinforce the context (cosmic horror, human insignificance).

### Component 4: Pacing (When Things Happen)

Pacing is the rhythm of experience—when tension builds, when relief comes, when resources refresh, when challenges escalate. Good pacing keeps players engaged. Bad pacing causes boredom or exhaustion.

**Session Arc** shapes individual play experiences. **Powered by the Apocalypse games** structure sessions like TV episodes—establish situation, escalate complications, reach climax, provide resolution. **Legacy games** like **Pandemic Legacy** (2015) end sessions on cliffhangers—driving continued play.

**Progression Arc** shapes long-term engagement. **Monster Hunter** (2004-present) follows a loop: hunt monster → craft gear from parts → hunt stronger monster. Each hunt is complete, but progression continues. **Slay the Spire** (2019) resets after each run but unlocks new cards and relics—temporary failure, permanent discovery.

**Mechanical Pacing** emerges from systems. In **Magic: The Gathering** (1993-present), the mana system naturally paces games—early turns have few options, late turns have many. In **Wingspan** (2019), engine-building creates acceleration—early turns are slow, late turns cascade with bonuses.

Pacing isn't a separate system—it emerges from how other components interact. Fast recovery + low scarcity = aggressive pacing. Slow recovery + high scarcity = cautious pacing. The designer controls pacing through parameter tuning, not additional mechanics.

### Component 5: Configuration (How It All Combines)

Configuration is how components work together. Coherent configuration makes systems feel purposeful. Incoherent configuration makes them feel arbitrary. This is where many games fail—individually good components that don't serve the same purpose.

**Configuration Coherence Test**: For each component, ask "Does this serve my primary aesthetic?" If the answer is no, you have configuration incoherence.

**D\&D for mystery investigation** fails this test:

* Mechanics (combat-focused) - Serves Challenge, not Discovery
* Parameters (resource attrition) - Serves Challenge, not Discovery
* Context (heroic fantasy) - Could serve Discovery
* Pacing (encounter-based) - Serves Challenge, not Discovery
  Result: Players solve mysteries by beating up suspects

**Gumshoe for mystery investigation** passes this test:

* Mechanics (automatic clue discovery) - Serves Discovery
* Parameters (point pools for bonuses) - Serves Discovery
* Context (detective fiction) - Serves Discovery
* Pacing (scene-based investigation) - Serves Discovery
  Result: Players solve mysteries by investigating

Configuration coherence doesn't mean everything must be identical—it means everything must pull in the same direction. **Return of the Obra Dinn** (2018) uses wildly different components (3D exploration, deduction interface, time-freeze mechanic) but they all serve Discovery aesthetic.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Five component analysis validated across hundreds of games.

## Section 4: Core Loops & Flow

### Understanding Core Loops

Core loops are the fundamental cycles of action and feedback that players repeat throughout play. They're the moment-to-moment experience that keeps players engaged. Every game has at least one core loop, and understanding loops helps you shape player experience at the most granular level.

### The Three Nested Loops

Games typically feature three nested loops operating at different timescales:

**Micro Loop** (seconds to minutes) - The immediate action-feedback cycle:

* **Tetris**: See piece → rotate/position → place → clear lines → see next piece
* **DOOM**: See demon → aim → shoot → demon dies → find next demon
* **Wordle**: Think word → type guess → see colored feedback → think new word

The micro loop creates flow state. When it's smooth, players lose track of time. When it's rough, every moment feels laborious.

**Core Loop** (minutes to hours) - The primary gameplay cycle:

* **Monster Hunter**: Accept quest → prepare loadout → hunt monster → carve materials → craft upgrades → accept harder quest
* **Civilization**: Explore map → found cities → build improvements → research technology → expand territory → encounter rivals → resolve conflicts → explore further
* **Slay the Spire**: Enter encounter → play cards → resolve combat → choose reward → modify deck → enter next encounter

The core loop defines what the game "is about." Ask someone what they do in a game, and they'll usually describe the core loop.

**Meta Loop** (hours to campaigns) - The long-term progression cycle:

* **Dark Souls**: Explore area → die to boss → learn patterns → defeat boss → unlock new area → face harder boss
* **Pokémon**: Catch pokémon → train team → defeat gym → earn badge → access new area → catch stronger pokémon
* **XCOM 2**: Complete mission → earn resources → research technology → upgrade soldiers → unlock harder missions → advance story

The meta loop provides purpose and progression. It's why players return session after session.

### How Loops Create Flow

**Flow state** (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) occurs when challenge perfectly matches skill. Too easy leads to boredom. Too hard leads to frustration. The sweet spot creates total absorption.

Core loops create flow through:

**Clear Objectives** - Players always know what to do next. In **Hades**, you always know your goal: reach the next chamber, defeat enemies, choose reward, repeat.

**Immediate Feedback** - Actions have instant, clear results. In **Super Meat Boy** (2010), you instantly know if a jump succeeded or failed. No ambiguity.

**Balance of Challenge and Skill** - Difficulty matches player ability. **Rocket League** (2015) matches you against similar skill levels. As you improve, opponents improve.

**Sense of Control** - Players feel their actions matter. In **Into the Breach**, perfect information means failure is your fault, success is your achievement.

Different aesthetics require different flow profiles:

**Challenge** aesthetic needs high challenge-skill balance. **Dark Souls** keeps you at the edge of your ability—victory feels earned because failure was so close.

**Fellowship** aesthetic needs low mechanical challenge. **Jackbox Games** keep mechanics trivial so players can focus on social interaction, not system mastery.

**Submission** aesthetic needs gentle, predictable flow. **Euro Truck Simulator 2** (2012) creates meditative flow through repetitive but satisfying driving loops.

**Discovery** aesthetic needs irregular rewards. **Breath of the Wild** breaks flow deliberately—korok seeds and shrines interrupt whatever you were doing, rewarding exploration over goal pursuit.

### Designing Effective Loops

**Keep micro loops tight**. The faster the feedback, the more engaging the experience. **Vampire Survivors** (2022) has an incredibly tight micro loop—enemies constantly approach, attacks constantly fire, experience constantly accumulates. Players can't look away.

**Make core loops complete**. Each cycle should feel satisfying on its own. **Hades** makes each run complete—you always reach an ending (death or escape), always earn permanent rewards (darkness, keys, nectar), always progress relationships. Even failure feels like progress.

**Give meta loops meaning**. Long-term goals must feel worthwhile. **Persona 5** (2017) makes its calendar system meaningful—you're not just getting stronger, you're deepening relationships, solving mysteries, changing society.

**Allow loop breaking**. Pure repetition becomes monotonous. **Spelunky 2** (2020) has a consistent core loop but adds secret areas, special events, and alternate paths. The loop provides structure, variations provide interest.

### When Loops Fail

**Loop Interruption** breaks flow. **Red Dead Redemption 2** (2018) constantly interrupts its loops with animations—looting requires watching Arthur bend down, search, stand up. Realistic but flow-breaking.

**Loop Confusion** loses players. **Death Stranding** (2019) has unclear loops initially—players don't understand the accept delivery → plan route → traverse terrain → deliver package → build infrastructure loop until hours in.

**Loop Exhaustion** causes burnout. **Destiny 2** (2017-present) has players repeat the same activities weekly for marginal gains. The loop works initially but becomes a chore over time.

**Loop Mismatch** conflicts with aesthetics. **SimCity** (2013) added always-online multiplayer to a traditionally Submission/Expression game. The social obligations broke the relaxing city-building loop many players wanted.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Core loop theory is fundamental to game design, validated across decades of research and practice.
