# Chapter 1: Understanding Game Systems

## The Same Mechanics, Different Games

In 2019, Weather Factory released **Cultist Simulator** (Card Management, 2019, PC/Mobile)—a game about founding an occult society while managing work, money, and sanity. Players manipulate cards representing everything from emotions to elder gods, placing them on verb tiles with timers. The experience is frantic, overwhelming, and deliberately opaque. Death lurks everywhere: starvation, madness, despair, or the attention of authorities.

In 2023, the same studio released **Book of Hours** (Library Management, 2023, PC)—a game about restoring an occult library. The core mechanics are identical: cards, verbs, timers. Yet the experience couldn't be more different. Book of Hours is meditative, cozy, forgiving. There's no death, no pressure, just the gentle satisfaction of organizing knowledge and uncovering mysteries at your own pace.

Same developer. Same mechanics. Completely different games.

This proves a fundamental truth: **game systems are not their mechanics**. A game system is the designed interplay between mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing that creates a reproducible experience through player interaction. Weather Factory didn't create two games—they created two different experiential scaffolds using the same mechanical foundation.

## Section 1: The Experiential Scaffold Framework

### What Is a Game System?

A game system is not simply "the rules." It's not a resolution mechanic (roll d20, draw cards, click buttons). It's not a collection of subsystems bolted together hoping they work.

**A game system is a purpose-built experiential scaffold**—a temporary structure that enables players to have experiences they couldn't otherwise access. Like construction scaffolding that lets workers reach heights they couldn't naturally achieve, game systems let players experience being heroes, villains, detectives, or even alien minds.

The scaffold metaphor is deliberate. Scaffolding:

* Has a specific purpose (reach this height, paint that wall)
* Is temporary (removed when the work is done)
* Isn't the point (the building matters, not the scaffold)
* Must be stable enough to support the work
* Can be constructed many ways for the same purpose

Similarly, game systems:

* Have experiential purposes (feel clever, feel powerful, feel scared)
* Exist during play (disappear when you stop playing)
* Aren't the point (the experience matters, not the system)
* Must be coherent enough to support the experience
* Can be designed many ways for the same aesthetic

### Purpose-First Design

Traditional game design often starts with mechanics. "What if we used cards instead of dice?" "What if players bid for actions?" "What if time moved backward?" These can lead to interesting games, but they're solving from the wrong end.

**Purpose-first design inverts this process**. Start with the experience you want players to have, then design backward to the system that creates it. This is the reversal at the heart of the MDA framework (Hunicke, LeBlanc, Zubek, 2004):

* **Players experience**: Aesthetics → Dynamics → Mechanics (working inward)
* **Designers create**: Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics (working outward)
* **But designers should START with**: Aesthetics (what experience?) → then design mechanics to achieve it

Consider **Dread** (Horror RPG, 2005, Tabletop). The designers didn't start with "let's use a Jenga tower." They started with wanting players to feel mounting tension and inevitable collapse. The Jenga tower emerged as the perfect mechanic for that experience: every action literally makes the next action harder, collapse is inevitable but unpredictable, and the physical act of pulling blocks creates actual tension in players' bodies.

### Why This Matters for Designers

**Configuration coherence** becomes testable. If your purpose is Challenge (overcoming difficulty through skill), then every component should serve that purpose:

* Mechanics that reward pattern recognition
* Parameters that make failure costly but fair
* Context that frames struggle as heroic
* Pacing that allows learning from failure

If any component contradicts the purpose—mechanics that randomize success, parameters that trivialize failure, context that makes struggle seem pointless—the scaffold becomes unstable. Players feel the incoherence even if they can't articulate it.

**Trade-offs become explicit**. You can't maximize all aesthetics simultaneously. A game optimized for Fellowship (social interaction) needs different cognitive load than one optimized for Challenge (skill development). Understanding your primary purpose lets you make consistent decisions when aesthetics conflict.

**Validation becomes possible**. "Is this game good?" is unanswerable. "Does this scaffold successfully create the intended experience?" is testable. You can observe whether players feel clever in your mystery game, whether they feel powerful in your power fantasy, whether they feel connected in your social game.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - This framework is validated across thousands of games and decades of design practice.

## Section 2: The Twelve Aesthetics

### Understanding Aesthetics

The MDA framework introduced aesthetics as "the desirable emotional responses evoked in the player." These aren't genres (fantasy, sci-fi) or mechanics (turn-based, real-time). They're the fundamental experiences players seek from games.

Think of aesthetics as the answer to "Why do people play this?" Not "to roll dice" or "to manage resources" but "to feel clever" or "to overcome challenges" or "to express creativity."

### The Core Eight (MDA Framework)

The original MDA framework identified eight fundamental aesthetics:

1. **Sensation** - Game as sense-pleasure. Beautiful art, satisfying sound effects, visceral feedback. **Journey** (2012) creates sensation through stunning visuals and soaring music. **Beat Saber** (2018) synchronizes music with physical motion.

2. **Fantasy** - Game as make-believe. Being someone else, somewhere else. **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** (2011) lets you be the Dragonborn. **Animal Crossing** (2020) lets you build an island paradise.

3. **Narrative** - Game as drama. Stories that unfold, characters that grow, plots that resolve. **The Last of Us** (2013) tells a father-daughter story through gameplay. **Disco Elysium** (2019) makes every dialogue choice shape your character's story.

4. **Challenge** - Game as obstacle course. Difficulties to overcome through skill and persistence. **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** (2019) demands perfect timing and pattern recognition. **Celeste** (2018) requires precise platforming but encourages persistence.

5. **Fellowship** - Game as social framework. Playing together, bonding through shared experience. **Among Us** (2020) creates social deduction and accusation. **It Takes Two** (2021) requires genuine cooperation to progress.

6. **Discovery** - Game as uncharted territory. Finding new things, uncovering secrets. **Outer Wilds** (2019) hides an entire solar system of mysteries. **Breath of the Wild** (2017) rewards exploration in every direction.

7. **Expression** - Game as self-discovery. Creating something uniquely yours. **Minecraft** (2011) provides blocks to build anything imaginable. **The Sims** (2000) lets you create and control virtual lives.

8. **Submission** - Game as pastime. Relaxing, turning your brain off, entering flow state. **Stardew Valley** (2016) offers gentle farming rhythms. **Tetris** (1984) creates a trance-like flow state.

### Our Four Expansions

Through analyzing modern games, we've identified four additional aesthetics that warrant separate classification:

9. **Mastery** - Game as system to deeply understand. Not just overcoming challenges but comprehending underlying systems. **Europa Universalis IV** (2013) rewards deep understanding of interconnected systems. **Street Fighter** (1987-present) has infinite depth in its fighting system. Distinct from Challenge: Challenge is about overcoming, Mastery is about understanding.

10. **Tension** - Game as adrenaline generator. Time pressure, high stakes, constant danger. **XCOM 2** (2016) puts every decision under time pressure. **Phasmophobia** (2020) creates tension through vulnerability. Distinct from Sensation: Sensation is sensory pleasure, Tension is psychological pressure.

11. **Progression** - Game as growth engine. Becoming stronger, unlocking new abilities, watching numbers increase. **Diablo** (1996-present) perfected the loot-and-level loop. **Cookie Clicker** (2013) distills progression to its essence. Distinct from Expression: Expression is creativity, Progression is advancement.

12. **Collection** - Game as accumulation. Gathering sets, completing catalogs, catching them all. **Pokémon** (1996-present) built an empire on collection. **Hades** (2020) uses collection to motivate repeated runs. Distinct from Discovery: Discovery is finding, Collection is possessing.

### Working with Aesthetics

**Primary vs. Secondary**. Most games serve multiple aesthetics, but one should dominate. **Dark Souls** (2011) primarily serves Challenge, with secondary Mastery and Discovery. When aesthetics conflict, the primary aesthetic wins. If Discovery would make Challenge trivial (finding an instant-win button), Challenge wins—no instant-win buttons exist.

**Aesthetic Coherence**. Every component should serve your primary aesthetic. **Papers, Please** (2013) creates Challenge through increasingly complex border inspection rules. The mechanics (checking documents), parameters (time pressure), context (authoritarian bureaucracy), and pacing (escalating complexity) all serve Challenge. Nothing is wasted.

**Player Expectations**. Players come to games seeking specific aesthetics. Someone playing **Dark Souls** expects Challenge—making it easier would break the promise. Someone playing **Animal Crossing** expects Submission and Expression—adding time pressure would violate the contract. Know what aesthetic promise you're making.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH for the original eight (validated by MDA framework research), MEDIUM for our four expansions (validated through our analysis but need broader testing).
