## Section 5: The Seven System Functions

Beyond their structural components, game systems perform specific functions—the actual work that enables play. Understanding these functions helps designers identify what their system needs to do, not just how it's built. Different aesthetics prioritize different functions.

### Function 1: Adjudication (Resolving Uncertainty)

Every game needs to answer "what happens?" when outcomes are uncertain. Without adjudication, play stalls or devolves into argument.

**Dice** provide transparent randomness. D\&D's d20 makes every action a 5% increment—players understand the odds. **GM fiat** provides narrative flexibility. The GM decides what makes sense for the story. **Algorithms** provide complex calculations. **XCOM** calculates hit percentages from cover, range, abilities, and modifiers. **Consensus** provides collaborative authority. **Microscope** (2011) has players collectively decide what happens in history. **LLMs** could provide natural language interpretation—describe your action in words, receive narratively appropriate outcome.

Different aesthetics need different adjudication. Challenge needs consistency (same action, same result). Narrative needs flexibility (dramatic moments matter more than rules). Fellowship needs transparency (everyone understands why things happened).

### Function 2: Information Management (Controlling Knowledge)

Games thrive on information asymmetry—what players know, don't know, and discover. Systems must manage what information exists, who knows it, when it's revealed, and what happens if it's missed.

**Traditional models** gate everything. In classic **D\&D**, if you fail your investigation roll, you don't find the clue. Investigation can stall completely. **Gumshoe** guarantees core information. Have the right skill in the right place? You find the core clue automatically. Spend points for extra details. **Apocalypse World** generates information through play. "Read a Situation" moves create facts that didn't exist before rolling.

Information is a resource like HP or gold—design when it's scarce, when it's abundant, how it's earned, what it costs. Mystery games make information the primary currency. Horror games make information scarce and unreliable. Discovery games make information the reward for exploration.

### Function 3: Content Generation (Creating Situations)

Without new content, games end when prepared material runs out. Systems need ways to create novel situations, encounters, locations, and challenges.

**Pre-authored content** provides quality but limits quantity. **Curse of Strahd** (2016) offers exceptional content but only for one campaign. **Procedural generation** provides quantity but risks incoherence. **No Man's Sky** (2016) generates infinite planets but they can feel samey. **Random tables** combine authored and procedural. **Stars Without Number** (2010) uses tables to combine pre-written elements into novel configurations. **Player contribution** makes players co-creators. **Fiasco** (2011) has players build the entire scenario from prompt cards.

LLMs could provide coherent improvisation—maintaining consistency while generating appropriate content on demand. The challenge is avoiding generic "AI slop" while preserving authorial voice.

### Function 4: State Persistence (Remembering Across Time)

Games need memory. Character growth, world changes, relationship evolution—these require the system to remember what happened and make it matter.

**Character sheets** track mechanical state. Level, HP, inventory, abilities. **Campaign logs** track narrative state. What happened, who you met, what you learned. **Faction systems** track world state. **Blades in the Dark** uses clocks and faction status to remember how organizations respond to player actions. **Save files** perfectly preserve everything. But sometimes too much—**Skyrim** remembers every moved cheese wheel, creating save bloat.

Different play patterns need different persistence. Weekly games can rely on player memory. Monthly games need extensive notes. **West Marches** campaigns distribute memory across many players through shared wikis. Video games handle persistence automatically but often fail at narrative continuity—NPCs repeat the same dialogue despite world-changing events.

### Function 5: Cognitive Encoding (Shaping Thought)

Mechanics don't just resolve actions—they shape how players think about problems. The system teaches players what matters, what's possible, and how to approach situations.

**Attributes define what matters**. D\&D's six attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) tell players these are the fundamental character traits. **Honey Heist** (2017) has only two stats: CRIMINAL and BEAR. This tells players everything about what kind of game this is.

**Actions define possibilities**. **Apocalypse World** moves name specific actions: "Go Aggro," "Seduce or Manipulate," "Read a Situation." Players think in terms of these moves. **Lasers & Feelings** (2013) has only two actions: LASERS (technology/reason) and FEELINGS (intuition/passion). Every problem becomes one or the other.

**Resources define values**. **Call of Cthulhu** tracks Sanity—immediately establishing that mental health matters and will be threatened. **Blades in the Dark** tracks Stress—telling players that pushing yourself has psychological cost.

This encoding can create specific experiences. Want players to think like alien minds? Create attributes that don't map to human concepts. Want players to avoid violence? Make violent actions mechanically inferior to alternatives.

### Function 6: Constraint Design (Creating Meaningful Limitations)

Constraints make games interesting. Unlimited resources, unlimited actions, unlimited time—these create boredom, not fun. Systems must create the right constraints for their aesthetic.

**Resource constraints** force prioritization. Limited spell slots make wizards choose carefully. Limited ammunition makes shooters conserve bullets. Limited time makes every action count. **Action constraints** create tactical depth. **Chess** pieces have specific movement patterns. **Into the Breach** mechs have specific abilities. Constraints create puzzles. **Victory constraints** shape strategy. **Twilight Struggle** (2005) limits victory to specific conditions—control regions, cause nuclear war (both lose), or reach turn 10 with most victory points.

Different aesthetics need different constraints. Challenge needs tight constraints that require optimal play. Expression needs loose constraints that allow creativity. Fellowship needs constraints that encourage cooperation over competition.

### Function 7: Procedural Content for Solo Play

Not all games have GMs or opponents. Systems need ways to generate opposition, situations, and narrative without human control.

**AI opponents** simulate human players. **Civilization** AI controls rival nations. Quality varies wildly—some feel human-like, others expose their algorithms immediately. **Oracle systems** answer questions. **Ironsworn** uses yes/no/yes-but/no-and oracles to resolve uncertainties in solo or co-op play. **Automated procedures** run themselves. **Four Against Darkness** (2016) uses tables and flowcharts to generate complete dungeon adventures. **Card-driven events** create narrative. **Robinson Crusoe** (2012) uses event cards to create story without a narrator.

Solo play is growing as people seek gaming experiences that fit their schedules. Systems that support good solo play expand their audience significantly.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - System functions are observable across all games, though their implementation varies.

## Section 6: How Components Create Dynamics

### The Emergence of Play

Dynamics are the behaviors that emerge when mechanics meet players. They're not designed directly—they arise from how components interact. You design mechanics and parameters, set context and pacing, ensure configuration coherence. Dynamics emerge from player interaction with this system.

### Mechanics + Parameters = Behavioral Patterns

Same mechanics with different parameters create entirely different dynamics:

**Rocket Jumping** emerged in **Quake** (1996). The mechanics: rockets have knockback, players have HP, explosion physics exist. The parameters: knockback is high, self-damage is manageable, maps have high places. The dynamic: players deliberately shoot rockets at their feet to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Id Software didn't design rocket jumping—players discovered it.

**Camping** emerges in battle royales. The mechanics: large map, shrinking circle, one life per match. The parameters: dying means waiting for next match, circle shrinks slowly, buildings provide cover. The dynamic: some players hide and avoid combat until forced. Developers didn't intend camping—it emerges from risk-averse play.

**Min-maxing** emerges in RPGs. The mechanics: character customization, statistical benefits, optimization possible. The parameters: some choices are mathematically superior, respecs are limited or costly. The dynamic: players sacrifice character concept for mechanical advantage. Designers create character options—players create spreadsheets.

### Context Transforms Meaning

Context changes how players interpret and approach identical mechanics:

**Permadeath** in **XCOM** creates attachment to soldiers. You name them after friends, mourn their loss, play cautiously to preserve them. **Permadeath** in **Rogue Legacy** (2013) creates humor. Your descendants have randomized genetic traits—one might be colorblind, another have IBS. Death is funny, not tragic.

**Collection** in **Pokémon** creates adventure. You're exploring the world, making friends with creatures. **Collection** in **Shin Megami Tensei** creates moral complexity. You're enslaving demons through negotiation or force. Same mechanic (creature collection), different context, different player behavior.

### Pacing Emerges from Parameters

Pacing isn't designed directly—it emerges from how quickly resources recover, how fast threats escalate, how long tasks take:

**Dark Souls** creates methodical pacing through:

* Slow healing animation (can't panic-heal)
* Limited healing items (conserve for bosses)
* Corpse runs (death has time cost)
* Checkpoint spacing (progress feels precious)

Nobody programmed "be methodical"—it emerges from parameters.

**DOOM Eternal** (2020) creates aggressive pacing through:

* Glory kills restore health (offense is defense)
* Chainsaw kills restore ammo (killing solves scarcity)
* Constant movement bonuses (standing still is death)
* Arena design (no safe spaces)

Nobody programmed "be aggressive"—it emerges from parameters.

### Configuration Coherence Creates Clear Dynamics

When all components pull in the same direction, dynamics become clear and satisfying:

**Hades** achieves configuration coherence:

* Mechanics: Tight combat with builds that emerge from boon combinations
* Parameters: Death resets runs but preserves meta-progression
* Context: Zagreus repeatedly escaping creates narrative justification for repetition
* Pacing: Each run takes 30-40 minutes—perfect session length
* Configuration: Everything serves "one more run" dynamic

Players naturally fall into the intended pattern: attempt escape, die, chat with NPCs, upgrade, attempt again. The dynamic feels inevitable because every component pushes toward it.

**Anthem** (2019) suffered configuration incoherence:

* Mechanics: Flying iron man suits suggests freedom
* Parameters: Constant tethering to teammates contradicts freedom
* Context: You're freelancer mercenary suggests independence
* Pacing: Long loading screens between every activity breaks flow
* Configuration: Components fight each other

Players felt the friction. The game wanted to be single-player power fantasy and multiplayer looter simultaneously. Components pulled in different directions, creating unsatisfying dynamics.

### Designing for Dynamics

You can't control dynamics directly, but you can shape them:

**Identify desired behavior**. What do you want players to do? Rush forward? Think carefully? Cooperate? Compete?

**Design components to encourage that behavior**. Want rushing? Make resources regenerate quickly, make standing still dangerous. Want thinking? Make resources scarce, make mistakes costly.

**Test whether dynamics emerge**. Players will surprise you. They'll find strategies you didn't anticipate, exploit systems you thought were balanced, avoid content you thought was mandatory.

**Adjust components, not dynamics**. You can't patch player behavior directly. You change mechanics, tune parameters, clarify context, adjust pacing. The dynamics shift in response.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - The relationship between components and dynamics is fundamental to all system design.

## Section 7: Reading the Rest of This Book

### The Journey Ahead

This chapter established the foundation—what game systems are, what they're made of, what they do. The remaining chapters explore how to build on this foundation, each tackling a crucial aspect of game design.

### Chapter 2: Resource Management

Resources are the currencies that create meaningful choices. HP, gold, ammunition, time, attention—these create scarcity that forces prioritization.

You'll learn:

* Five resource types (Consumable, Buffer, Accumulation, Composition, Capacity)
* How recovery patterns determine pacing
* Psychological effects of ownership, scarcity, and loss
* How to match resources to aesthetics
* Common resource anti-patterns to avoid

This chapter builds on the Components framework, showing how Parameters (scarcity levels, recovery rates) create different dynamics from the same resource Mechanics.

### Chapter 3: Cognitive Load and Game System Design

Every game demands mental effort. Tracking resources, evaluating options, remembering rules, recognizing patterns—these create cognitive load that shapes who can play and how they experience your game.

You'll learn:

* Seven types of cognitive load (Simultaneity, Decision, Memory, Tracking, Calculation, Pattern Recognition, Social)
* How different aesthetics require different load profiles
* Load as design constraint, not resource
* Supporting necessary load vs. removing unnecessary load
* How player expertise changes load over time

This chapter connects to every other aspect of design—resources create tracking load, balance must be perceivable despite load, context affects memory load, pacing must account for cognitive fatigue.

### Chapter 4: From Principles to Numbers (Balance)

Balance isn't about making everything equal—it's about creating appropriate challenge for your chosen aesthetic. Different aesthetics need different balance paradigms.

You'll learn:

* Three balance paradigms (Framework, Consistency, Adaptive)
* How to match paradigm to aesthetic
* Concrete balancing formulas and measurables
* Why balance must be perceivable, not just mathematical
* Playtesting protocols for validation

This chapter synthesizes previous concepts, showing how Components must be configured coherently, how cognitive load affects perceived balance, and how resources create the levers for balancing.

### Chapter 5: Context - From Setting to Experience

Context transforms abstract mechanics into meaningful experiences. Genre determines required dynamics. Dressing provides aesthetic wrapper. Perspective maintains emotional tone.

You'll learn:

* Genre vs. dressing distinction
* How context shapes player behavior
* Build/Suggest/Omit framework for worldbuilding
* Perspective coherence across all elements
* How the same mechanics create different games through context

This chapter reveals how Context (Component 3) isn't just flavor—it fundamentally shapes how players approach your game, what dynamics emerge, and whether your scaffold achieves its purpose.

### Chapter 6: Synthesis (Planned)

The book concludes with complete worked examples, showing all frameworks operating together:

* Full game designs from aesthetic to implementation
* Diagnostic tools for when games aren't working
* Integration patterns for LLM augmentation
* Validation protocols for testing experiential scaffolds

### How to Use This Book

**If you're designing a new game**: Read chapters in order. Each builds on the previous, giving you tools to construct your experiential scaffold systematically.

**If you're fixing an existing game**: Jump to the relevant chapter. Game feels tedious? Check pacing in Chapter 4. Players confused? Check cognitive load in Chapter 3. Mechanics feel meaningless? Check context in Chapter 5.

**If you're analyzing games**: Use the frameworks as lenses. What aesthetic does this serve? What functions does it perform? What cognitive load does it create? How are its resources balanced?

**If you're integrating LLMs**: Pay special attention to System Functions (this chapter) and Information Management (Chapter 2). LLMs excel at some functions, fail at others. Design accordingly.

## Chapter Summary

### Key Principles

**Games are experiential scaffolds**. They're not about mechanics—they're about the experiences those mechanics enable. The scaffold exists to support the experience.

**Design from purpose**. Start with your intended aesthetic, then design components to achieve it. Don't start with cool mechanics and hope they create something meaningful.

**Configuration coherence matters**. All five components (Mechanics, Parameters, Context, Pacing, Configuration) must serve the same aesthetic. Incoherence creates friction players feel even if they can't articulate it.

**Dynamics emerge**. You don't design player behavior directly—you design components that encourage certain dynamics. Players will surprise you.

**Systems perform functions**. Beyond their structure, systems do work: adjudicate outcomes, manage information, generate content, persist state, encode cognition, create constraints, enable solo play. Different aesthetics prioritize different functions.

**Core loops create engagement**. The micro loop creates flow, the core loop defines the game, the meta loop provides purpose. All three must align with your aesthetic.

### The Aesthetic-First Design Process

1. **Choose your primary aesthetic**. What experience do you want players to have? Use the twelve aesthetics as starting points.

2. **Identify required functions**. What work must your system perform? Mystery needs information management. Horror needs constraint design. Fellowship needs low adjudication overhead.

3. **Design components coherently**. Create mechanics that serve your aesthetic. Set parameters that encourage desired dynamics. Choose context that reinforces meaning. Tune pacing through parameters. Ensure configuration coherence.

4. **Construct appropriate loops**. Design micro loops that create appropriate flow. Build core loops that deliver your aesthetic. Create meta loops that provide long-term purpose.

5. **Manage cognitive load deliberately**. Know what mental effort your game demands. Support necessary load, remove unnecessary load. Match load profile to aesthetic.

6. **Test whether scaffold achieves purpose**. Do players experience your intended aesthetic? If not, identify which component or function is failing. Adjust and test again.

### What's Next

Chapter 2 explores resources in depth—the currencies and constraints that create meaningful decisions. You'll learn how different resource types serve different aesthetics, how recovery patterns shape pacing, and how to design resource systems that support your experiential scaffold.

The journey from concept to playable game requires many decisions. This framework ensures those decisions align toward a coherent purpose: creating the experience you intended, supported by systems that make it possible.

The scaffold is not the destination. It's what makes the journey possible.

**Confidence Level for Chapter Overall**: HIGH for established concepts (MDA, components, functions), MEDIUM for our extensions (four additional aesthetics, specific categorizations), LOW for untested integrations (LLM functions, some dynamic predictions).
