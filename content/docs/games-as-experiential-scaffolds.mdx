# Games as Experiential Scaffolds: A Design Framework

## A Note on This Draft

This book is a work in progress—a **very early draft** that will change substantially. What you're reading represents current thinking, but the framework is still evolving. Sections may be incomplete, arguments may shift, examples may be replaced, and entire chapters may be reorganized or rewritten as the ideas develop. Consider this a snapshot of active research and design work, not a finished text. Feedback, questions, and challenges are welcome as the work continues to take shape.

## Introduction

Game design traditionally begins with an ontological question: "What is a game?" This leads to endless debates about definitions, boundaries, and categories. This book takes a different approach. Instead of asking what games *are*, we ask: **What experience do we want someone to have, and what game system best creates that experience?**

This reframing shifts game design from creating entertainment to creating structured experiences that let people understand, feel, or explore something they couldn't otherwise access. A game system is a scaffold—a designed structure that enables play experiences. The system is what designers create; the game is what emerges when players engage with that system. Throughout this book, we focus on designing systems as experiential scaffolds, understanding that games—the actual lived experiences—emerge from player interaction with these carefully constructed frameworks. Like construction scaffolding, the structure itself isn't the point. What matters is what it enables you to do, understand, or feel.

## Purpose-Built Systems

When we design games as purpose-built experiential scaffolds, the design process inverts. Rather than starting with mechanics and hoping they create something meaningful, we start with the experience and work backward to the systems that can reliably produce it.g

Consider several examples of purpose-built game systems:

**Exploring Inequality Through Mechanics**: A game designed to make players viscerally understand systemic inequality creates asymmetric starting resources, makes wealth compound through mechanics, and structures victory conditions around accumulated capital rather than moral choices. Players don't just read about inequality—they feel the frustration of being locked out of opportunities or the temptation of using wealth to maintain advantage. Elizabeth Magie's *The Landlords Game* (1904), later known as Monopoly, was explicitly designed with this purpose—the mechanics themselves were the argument.

**Inhabiting Story Worlds**: Games designed to let players experience being inside their favorite fiction must preserve what makes that world feel authentic—its tone, types of conflicts, and power levels. *Blades in the Dark* (2017) creates heist stories in a haunted Victorian city through mechanics like flashbacks, stress, and crew advancement that all push toward that specific experience. The system enforces the internal logic and tone so players don't accidentally break the feel of the setting.

**Ethical Exploration**: Games that let players explore moral questions—what is evil? when is violence justified?—present dilemmas where all choices have real consequences. *Dogs in the Vineyard* (2004) casts players as religious enforcers in a frontier setting, forcing decisions about when to use violence, when to forgive, when to impose doctrine. By making ethical questions into gameplay decisions with stakes, players engage emotionally rather than abstractly.

**Structured Discovery**: Detective games create the experience of solving mysteries through investigation rather than lucky dice rolls. The Gumshoe system ensures players find core clues automatically, then focuses gameplay on what they do with those clues. The scaffold removes the "bad roll means no progress" problem that plagues traditional mystery games.

## The Constraints We've Worked Within

Traditional game design has been constrained by what's feasible. Human game masters have limited preparation time and can't maintain perfect consistency. Computer games have had to choose between authored content—finite but coherent—or procedural content—infinite but often shallow. Game systems had to be simple enough for humans to execute or computers to calculate.

These constraints shaped what kinds of experiential scaffolds were practical to build. Complex adaptive systems that maintained thematic coherence while responding to unpredictable player actions required either enormous human effort or sacrifices in depth and consistency.

## New Possibilities

Large language models potentially change what's feasible. Rather than choosing between authored and procedural content, we can potentially design around experiential purpose first, then use LLMs to maintain that purpose while adapting to unpredictable player actions. This isn't about replacing human game masters—it's about designing games that weren't feasible before.

LLMs offer **purpose-preserving adaptation**: encoding the experiential goal into the system and letting the LLM maintain internal consistency and thematic coherence while responding to unanticipated player actions. They enable **scaffold maintenance**—the system can remember what the experience is supposed to feel like and adapt on the fly.

This is not just about infinite content. It's about systems that can maintain their purpose across emergent play.

## The Questions This Book Explores

This framework raises fundamental questions about game design:

* What experiential purposes can games serve? Emotional, intellectual, social, exploratory?

* What game mechanics map to which purposes? How do rules shape experience?games-as-

* What do LLMs actually change? Not more content, but different system architectures now

* What's the difference between a game and an experience? When does structure stop being playful and become didactic?

* How do you validate that a scaffold achieves its purpose? How do you test if players got the intended experience?

## What This Book Covers

This book develops a comprehensive framework for designing games as purpose-built experiential scaffolds. It examines:

**Resource Management**: How in-game resources—from HP and ammunition to stress, reputation, and narrative control—create strategic choices and shape player experience.

**Cognitive Load**: How the mental effort required to play shapes what experiences are possible, and how to design systems where cognitive load serves rather than obstructs the intended experience.

**System Coherence**: How mechanics, parameters, context, and pacing work together to create coherent experiences—and how incoherent systems create cognitive friction even when individually simple.

**Balance**: Not as an abstract ideal, but as a tool for creating specific experiences—and how balance must be perceivable, not just mathematically perfect.

**LLM Integration**: Where large language models can genuinely expand what's possible versus where they're just "space coffee"—superficial applications that don't change anything fundamental.

Throughout, the book emphasizes that these elements don't exist in isolation. Every design decision has implications for resources, cognitive load, system coherence, balance, and the overall experiential scaffold we're building.

## How to Use This Book

This book is both theoretical framework and practical guide. It draws on game design theory, cognitive psychology, and concrete analysis of existing games across tabletop and digital formats. The goal is not to provide recipes, but to develop design literacy—the ability to see how systems create experiences, diagnose when they fail to do so, and construct new scaffolds for new purposes.

Whether you're designing tabletop RPGs, video games, educational experiences, or entirely new forms of interactive media, the fundamental question remains the same: What experience do we want someone to have, and what system best creates that experience?

The scaffold is not the destination. It's what makes the journey possible.
