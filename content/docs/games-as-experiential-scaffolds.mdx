# Games as Purpose-Built Experiential Scaffolds

## Core Concept

Instead of asking "what is a game?" (an ontological question about definitions), we can ask: **"What experience do we want someone to have, and what game system best creates that experience?"**

This reframes game design from creating entertainment to creating **structured experiences that let people understand, feel, or explore something they couldn't otherwise access**.

A game, in this view, is a **scaffold** - a temporary structure that supports an experience. The scaffold itself isn't the point; what matters is what it enables you to do, understand, or feel.

## Key Insight

Traditional game design has been constrained by what's feasible:

* Human GMs have limited preparation time and can't maintain perfect consistency
* Computer games have had to choose between authored content (finite but coherent) or procedural content (infinite but often shallow)
* Game systems had to be simple enough for humans to execute or computers to calculate

With LLMs, we can potentially design around **experiential purpose first**, then use the LLM to maintain that purpose while adapting to unpredictable player actions. This isn't "replace the GM with AI" - it's "design games that weren't feasible before."

## Examples of Purpose-Built Game Systems

### 1. **Exploring Inequality Through Mechanics**

**Purpose:** Make players viscerally understand systemic inequality, not just intellectually acknowledge it.

**Scaffold Design:**

* Players start with asymmetric resources (one player has 10x the money of another)
* Rules make it easier to earn money when you already have money (investment opportunities require minimum capital)
* Players can form coalitions, but the wealthy player can always outbid
* Victory conditions favor accumulated wealth, not moral choices

**Why It Works:** Players don't just read about inequality - they feel the frustration of being locked out of opportunities, or the temptation of using wealth to stay on top. The game system *is* the argument.

**Real Example:** *Monopoly* was originally designed (as "The Landlord's Game" by Elizabeth Magie, 1904) to teach about the problems with land monopolies. The mechanics themselves were meant to demonstrate economic injustice.

### 2. **Inhabiting a Story World**

**Purpose:** Let players experience being inside their favorite book/movie, not just talk about it.

**Scaffold Design:**

* The game system must preserve what makes that world feel authentic (tone, types of conflicts, power levels)
* Mechanics should emphasize the themes of that world (a noir detective game needs mechanics for investigation and moral compromise, not tactical combat)
* Players need freedom to make choices, but the system should "bend" outcomes back toward genre-appropriate results

**Why It Works:** The system enforces the internal logic and tone of the fictional world, so players don't accidentally break the feel of the setting.

**Real Example:** *Blades in the Dark* (2017) is designed specifically to create heist stories in a haunted Victorian city. The mechanics (flashbacks, stress, crew advancement) all push toward that specific experience.

### 3. **Ethical Exploration Through Constrained Choice**

**Purpose:** Let players explore moral questions (what is evil? when is violence justified?) through meaningful decisions.

**Scaffold Design:**

* Present dilemmas where all choices have real consequences
* Don't make "good" and "evil" choices obviously different in effectiveness
* Let players see long-term ripple effects of their decisions
* The system should be transparent about consequences but not judgmental

**Why It Works:** By making ethical questions into gameplay decisions with stakes, players engage emotionally, not just abstractly.

**Real Example:** *Dogs in the Vineyard* (2004) - players are religious enforcers in a frontier setting. The game forces you to decide when to use violence, when to forgive, when to impose doctrine. There are no mechanical "good guy" bonuses - you just face consequences.

### 4. **Detective Games and Structured Discovery**

**Purpose:** Create the experience of solving a mystery through investigation, not lucky dice rolls.

**Scaffold Design:**

* Information must be discoverable but not obvious
* The world must be internally consistent (clues can't contradict each other)
* Players need tools to organize information (not just remember everything)
* Dead ends should feel like dead ends for reasons players can discover

**Why It Works:** The mystery isn't about the GM having a secret - it's about the world being coherent enough that investigation yields real discoveries.

**Real Example:** *Gumshoe* system (various games) - ensures that players find core clues automatically, then focuses gameplay on what they *do* with those clues. The scaffold removes the "bad roll means no progress" problem.

## The LLM Opportunity

Traditionally, you had to choose:

* **Authored content:** Finite scenarios the designer anticipated (railroad or prepare hundreds of contingencies)
* **Procedural systems:** Infinite but often incoherent or shallow (random dungeons, Mad Libs storytelling)

LLMs potentially offer:

* **Purpose-preserving adaptation:** Encode the experiential goal into the system, let the LLM maintain internal consistency and thematic coherence while responding to unanticipated player actions
* **Scaffold maintenance:** The LLM can "remember" what the experience is supposed to feel like and adapt on the fly

This is NOT just "infinite content" - it's "systems that can maintain their purpose across emergent play."

## Research Questions to Explore

1. **What experiential purposes can games serve?** (emotional, intellectual, social, exploratory?)
2. **What game mechanics map to which purposes?** (how do rules shape experience?)
3. **What do LLMs actually change?** (not "more content" but "different system architectures now possible")
4. **What's the difference between a game and an experience?** (when does structure stop being playful and become didactic?)
5. **How do you validate that a scaffold achieves its purpose?** (how do you test if players "got" the intended experience?)

### Optional: Adjacent Fields

**Jesper Juul - "Half-Real: Video Games between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds" (2005)**

* Academic but foundational on how rules and fiction interact
* Useful for understanding the "magic circle" concept

**Katie Salen & Eric Zimmerman - "Rules of Play" (2003)**

* Comprehensive game design textbook
* Dense, but Chapter 7 ("Games as the Play of Meaning") is relevant
* More reference than cover-to-cover read

## Getting Started

**Day 1-2:** Read Costikyan's essay and the MDA paper. Play or read *Fiasco* or *Microscope* (both available as PDFs). Write down: what experience is this game trying to create? How do the mechanics serve that purpose?

**Day 3-4:** Pick one "serious game" or purpose-driven RPG (Monopoly's original version, *Dogs in the Vineyard*, *My Life With Master*). Analyze: what's the experiential purpose? How could you tell if it succeeded?

**Day 5-6:** Research what people are doing with LLMs in games right now. What seems like "space coffee" (just slapping AI on existing concepts)? What seems like genuinely new scaffolds?

**Ongoing:** When you encounter any game, ask: "What is this game trying to make me understand/feel/explore?" Then: "Do the mechanics serve that purpose, or work against it?"

## Discussion Questions for Your Advisor

After doing some reading:

1. Do you agree that games can be "purpose-built experiential scaffolds"? Or is this too narrow/specific a view?
2. What experiential purposes interest you most? (social, ethical, exploratory, emotional, intellectual?)
3. Can you think of a game that does its purpose BADLY? (scaffold doesn't match goal?) What would fix it?
4. What do you think LLMs actually change about what's possible? (avoid "space coffee" answers)
5. Is there a specific domain (detective stories? ethical dilemmas? historical exploration?) you want to explore deeper?
