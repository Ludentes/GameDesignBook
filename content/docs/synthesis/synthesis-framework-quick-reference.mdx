## Phase-by-Phase Checklist

### Phase 0: Starting Point

**Goal:** Identify your entry point and initial direction

* [ ] Choose entry path (Aesthetic/Constraint/Theme/Mechanic-first)
* [ ] Identify tentative aesthetic direction
* [ ] Document known constraints
* [ ] Note player profile (even if broad)
* [ ] Optional: Choose medium, setting, or archetype

**Output:** Starting specification with direction

**Critical Question:** "What experience for whom in what context?"

**Time Investment:** 30 minutes to 2 hours

***

### Phase 1: Aesthetic Crystallization

**Goal:** Formalize complete aesthetic profile

**Step 1.1: Define Primary Aesthetics**

* [ ] Identify primary aesthetic(s) (main experience)
* [ ] Identify secondary aesthetics (supporting)
* [ ] Identify exclusions (what this is NOT)
* [ ] Validate compatibility using Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes

**Step 1.2: Select Player Profile**

* [ ] Choose cognitive investment level (Casual/Midcore/Hardcore)
* [ ] Define session length expectations
* [ ] Consider platform context
* [ ] Consider social context (solo/multiplayer/sync/async)
* [ ] Note special needs (accessibility, busy adults, etc.)

**Step 1.3: Set Success Criteria**

* [ ] Define what perfect success feels like
* [ ] Set measurable outcomes (from Measurables Catalog)
* [ ] Define minimum viable aesthetic (what MUST work)
* [ ] Define failure conditions (how you'd know it failed)

**Output:** Complete aesthetic profile with validation criteria

**Critical Question:** "What aesthetics and how will I measure success?"

**Time Investment:** 1-3 hours

**Chapter References:**

* Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes (Part 3)
* Players & Contexts section
* Measurables Catalog (Part 5)

***

### Phase 2: Scaffold Architecture

**Goal:** Choose and specify structural pattern

**Step 2.1: Choose Structural Pattern**

* [ ] Evaluate pattern options:
  * Loop-Based (Full Stack/Compressed/Inverted/Constrained)
  * Narrative Arc (3-5 act structure)
  * Puzzle (discrete challenges)
  * Exploration (space-based progression)
  * Progression (numerical advancement)
* [ ] Use decision matrix (Aesthetic + Player Profile → Architecture)
* [ ] Choose archetype if applicable (or note "custom")

**Step 2.2: Design Temporal Structure**

* [ ] For loops: Define micro/meso/macro scales and durations
* [ ] For narrative: Define acts and decision points
* [ ] For other patterns: Define equivalent structure
* [ ] Specify pacing requirements
* [ ] Ensure structure serves primary aesthetic

**Step 2.3: Allocate Cognitive Load**

* [ ] Set total budget from player profile
* [ ] Allocate to core mechanic (largest portion)
* [ ] Allocate to goal tracking
* [ ] Allocate to resource management
* [ ] Allocate to meta-progression/context
* [ ] Allocate to social/communication (if multiplayer)
* [ ] Validate total within budget

**Output:** Complete scaffold specification with temporal structure

**Critical Question:** "What structure supports these aesthetics for these players?"

**Time Investment:** 2-4 hours

**Chapter References:**

* Temporal Architecture: Loops chapter
* Cognitive Load chapter
* Archetype Library (Appendix A)

***

### Phase 3: Mechanical Specification

**Goal:** Define specific mechanics, resources, and parameters

**Step 3.1: Select Core Mechanics**

* [ ] If from archetype: Review typical mechanics, decide keep/change
* [ ] If custom: Map aesthetics to mechanic categories
* [ ] Specify core verbs (what do players DO)
* [ ] Specify interaction model
* [ ] Specify decision space
* [ ] Validate each mechanic serves aesthetic
* [ ] Cut mechanics that don't justify cognitive cost

**Step 3.2: Design Resource Systems**

* [ ] Identify needed resource types (Limiters/Currencies/Trackers/Meta)
* [ ] Apply 3-5 resource guideline
* [ ] Define scarcity/abundance patterns
* [ ] Design recovery mechanisms
* [ ] Map resources to aesthetics they serve
* [ ] Specify cross-resource interactions

**Step 3.3: Set Initial Parameters**

* [ ] Use Measurables Catalog for target numbers
* [ ] Set parameter ranges for tuning
* [ ] Define success/failure conditions
* [ ] Establish progression curves (if applicable)
* [ ] For video games: Specific numeric values
* [ ] For TTRPGs: Roll mechanics and guidance ranges
* [ ] For board games: Component counts and economies

**Output:** Complete mechanical specification with resources and parameters

**Critical Question:** "What specific mechanics create the intended dynamics?"

**Time Investment:** 4-8 hours

**Chapter References:**

* Chapter 1: System Components
* Resource Management chapters
* Measurables Catalog (Part 6)
* Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes

***

### Phase 4: Content Specification

**Goal:** Determine content requirements and integration

**Step 4.1: Calculate Content Needs**

* [ ] Use base formula: Session Length × Expected Sessions / Consumption Rate
* [ ] Adjust for aesthetic type:
  * Discovery: High variety (3x multiplier)
  * Mastery: Low variety, high replayability
  * Challenge: Moderate variety
  * Narrative: Linear or branching calculation
* [ ] For loops: Calculate per scale (micro/meso/macro)
* [ ] For narrative: Calculate decision points × branches
* [ ] For puzzles: Calculate daily/weekly needs
* [ ] Specify minimum viable and sustainable targets

**Step 4.2: Procedural vs. Authored Decision**

* [ ] Evaluate procedural viability (systemic content, budget constraints)
* [ ] Evaluate authored needs (narrative coherence, quality requirements)
* [ ] Choose approach: Pure procedural / Pure authored / Hybrid
* [ ] If hybrid: Define template count and variation rules

**Step 4.3: Information Architecture**

* [ ] Design tutorial (what must be taught immediately)
* [ ] Design onboarding (first session/week progression)
* [ ] Design feedback systems (immediate/short-term/long-term)
* [ ] Specify complexity ramping schedule

**Step 4.4: Context Integration (Build/Suggest/Omit)**

* [ ] If setting chosen: Apply Build/Suggest/Omit framework
  * Build: Essential thematic elements
  * Suggest: Supporting atmospheric elements
  * Omit: Contradictory elements
* [ ] If setting not chosen: Select one or go abstract
* [ ] Validate mechanics and setting reinforce each other
* [ ] Ensure theme serves aesthetics (not vice versa)
* [ ] Iterate until coherent

**Output:** Content specification with theme integration

**Critical Question:** "How much content is enough and how is it dressed?"

**Time Investment:** 3-6 hours

**Chapter References:**

* Context chapter (Build/Suggest/Omit)
* Content formulas (Appendix C)
* Heuristic → Formula examples (Part 4)

***

### Phase 5: Validation & Iteration

**Goal:** Verify design works and identify fixes

**Step 5.1: Coherence Audit**

* [ ] Aesthetic coherence: Every mechanic serves primary aesthetic
* [ ] Structural coherence: Loops/beats connect properly
* [ ] Thematic coherence: Setting and mechanics reinforce
* [ ] Cognitive load coherence: Total within budget, priorities correct
* [ ] Identify what can be cut

**Step 5.2: Dynamics Prediction**

* [ ] For loops: Check dynamics checklist
  * Micro success → meso progress
  * Meso success → macro progress
  * Failure provides value
  * Long-term goals visible from short-term
  * Resources create tensions
  * Meaningful choices at each scale
* [ ] For narrative: Check arc checklist
  * Early decisions → later consequences
  * Escalating tension
  * Revelations recontextualize
  * Meaningful player agency
* [ ] Predict optimizations (desired or problematic?)
* [ ] Predict emergent strategies
* [ ] Predict stuck points
* [ ] Identify unintended dynamics

**Step 5.3: Paper Playtest**

* [ ] Walk through complete session
* [ ] Track resources manually
* [ ] Simulate decision points
* [ ] Note unclear or broken rules
* [ ] Test first 5 minutes (clear what to do?)
* [ ] Test first hour (engaging?)
* [ ] Test mid-session (progress meaningful?)
* [ ] Test end (satisfying?)
* [ ] Test return decision (would play again?)

**Step 5.4: Iteration Protocol**

* [ ] Identify problems from playtest
* [ ] Diagnose fix level:
  * Numbers wrong → Tune parameters (quick)
  * Mechanics don't create feel → Change mechanics (moderate)
  * Structure doesn't support aesthetic → Restructure architecture (major)
  * Players won't engage → Aesthetic mismatch (pivot)
* [ ] Apply appropriate fix
* [ ] Re-validate
* [ ] Decide: Implement or iterate further

**Output:** Validated design ready for implementation OR clear iteration plan

**Critical Question:** "Does this actually work and what needs fixing?"

**Time Investment:** 4-8 hours (first pass), ongoing (iteration)

## Common Red Flags

### Phase 1 Red Flags:

* ❌ "I want to create all aesthetics" (unfocused)
* ❌ "This is for everyone" (no target audience)
* ❌ "Success means fun" (unmeasurable)
* ❌ Conflicting aesthetics (Horror + Power Fantasy)

### Phase 2 Red Flags:

* ❌ Cognitive load exceeds player capacity
* ❌ Architecture doesn't match aesthetic (Discovery with no exploration)
* ❌ Loop scales disconnected (meso doesn't feed macro)
* ❌ Session length doesn't match player context

### Phase 3 Red Flags:

* ❌ More than 5-7 resources
* ❌ Mechanics that don't serve aesthetic
* ❌ "It's complex but important" (cognitive overload)
* ❌ Success determined by randomness not skill (for Challenge aesthetic)

### Phase 4 Red Flags:

* ❌ Content needs exceed budget by 10x
* ❌ "Space coffee" (theme contradicts mechanics)
* ❌ Tutorial longer than first session
* ❌ Discovery aesthetic with no content variety plan

### Phase 5 Red Flags:

* ❌ Can't paper playtest (too complex to track)
* ❌ Dominant strategy trivializes challenge
* ❌ No failure recovery (dead end on mistake)
* ❌ "It will be fun once we add content" (structural problem)

## Iteration Diagnostic Flowchart

```
Problem identified in playtest
    ↓
Are the numbers wrong? (win rates, pacing, costs)
    YES → Tune parameters (hours to days)
    NO ↓
Do mechanics not create the intended feel?
    YES → Change mechanics, keep structure (days to weeks)
    NO ↓
Does structure not support aesthetics?
    YES → Restructure architecture (weeks to months)
    NO ↓
Do players fundamentally not engage?
    YES → Aesthetic mismatch - pivot or change audience (major revision)
```

**When to persist:** Core aesthetic moments land, execution needs work

**When to pivot:** Core aesthetic moments don't land even when well-executed

## Time Investment Summary

| Phase                  | Typical Time     | When to Spend More                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Phase 0**            | 30 min - 2 hours | Multiple constraints, unclear direction          |

| **Phase 5**            | 4-8 hours+       | Complex systems, multiple iterations needed      |
| **Total (first pass)** | 14-31 hours      | Expect multiple iterations                       |

**Note:** These are thinking/design times, not implementation times.

***

## Using This Quick Reference

**First time through the framework:**

* Use this as a progress tracker
* Check off items as you complete them
* Reference the main chapter text for details

**Subsequent designs:**

* Start here instead of reading full chapters
* Jump to detailed sections only when stuck
* Use as a checklist to ensure nothing skipped

**Mid-project:**

* Use as diagnostic tool (which phase has problems?)
* Use iteration flowchart to identify fix level
* Use red flags to spot common mistakes

**For team communication:**

* Share phase outputs to align team
* Use critical questions to frame discussions
* Reference matrices for objective decisions

***

## What If I Get Stuck?

### Stuck at Phase 1?

* Problem: Can't identify aesthetics
* Solution: Play games similar to your concept, note what feels good
* Alternative: Start with constraints (Phase 0 Path B)

### Stuck at Phase 2?

* Problem: Don't know which architecture
* Solution: Use decision matrix (Aesthetic + Player Profile → Architecture)
* Alternative: Choose closest archetype as starting point

### Stuck at Phase 3?

* Problem: Don't know which mechanics
* Solution: Start with archetype template if available
* Alternative: Use Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes for mechanic categories
* Fallback: Prototype multiple options, test which feels right

### Stuck at Phase 4?

* Problem: Don't know how much content
* Solution: Use content formulas for your aesthetic type
* Alternative: Estimate conservatively, plan to expand if needed

### Stuck at Phase 5?

* Problem: Paper playtest reveals fundamental problems
* Solution: Use iteration flowchart to identify fix level
* Alternative: If multiple major problems, return to Phase 1

### Generally stuck?

* Consult worked examples in Part 2 of book
* Review common pitfalls (Appendix D)
* Consider if you're at wrong phase (back up or skip forward)
* Ask: "What decision do I need to make?" then find which phase addresses it

***

## Framework Philosophy Reminders

**The framework is:**

* A pathway, not a prescription
* Sequential but iterative
* Flexible within structure
* Practical over theoretical

**The framework is not:**

* A guarantee of success
* A replacement for playtesting
* A way to avoid iteration
* One-size-fits-all

**Key principles:**

* Aesthetics drive design (not mechanics or theme)
* Every element must justify its cognitive cost
* Match design to player capacity and context
* Coherence matters more than completeness
* Iteration is expected and healthy

**When in doubt:**

* Return to aesthetic goals ("Does this serve the experience?")
* Consider the player ("Can they handle this?")
* Simplify ("Can I cut this and lose nothing important?")
* Test early ("Can I validate this on paper?")

***

## Next Steps After Framework Completion

### If validation passed:

1. Create detailed design document
2. Build minimum viable prototype
3. Conduct actual playtests (not paper)
4. Iterate based on real play data
5. Expand to full implementation

### If validation revealed problems:

1. Apply appropriate iteration (per flowchart)
2. Re-validate changed elements
3. Consider if pivot needed
4. Don't proceed to implementation until coherent

### For ongoing development:

* Return to framework when adding features
* Use Phase 5 validation for each addition
* Maintain aesthetic coherence as you expand
* Cut features that don't serve core aesthetic
