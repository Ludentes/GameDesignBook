# Phase 3: System Specification - What Are the Actual Rules?

## Overview

Phase 3 defines the concrete system elements that players interact with - the rules, resources, and parameters that bring your scaffold to life. This is where we move from architecture to implementation.

**Critical terminology clarification:**

* **System Elements** = The designed rules and procedures (what MDA calls "mechanics")
* **Core Verbs** = What players actually DO
* **Dynamics** = Patterns that emerge from system elements + player agency (predicted in Phase 5)
* **Resources** = Trackable quantities players manage
* **Parameters** = Numeric values and ranges

We're NOT yet predicting dynamics (emergent patterns) - that comes in Phase 5. Here we're designing the system elements that will create those dynamics.

***

## Step 3.1: Define Core Verbs

### What Are Core Verbs?

Core verbs are what players actually DO in your game. Not the rules that govern those actions, but the actions themselves.

**Examples:**

* Shoot, dodge, jump (action game)
* Investigate, interrogate, deduce (mystery game)
* Build, harvest, craft (crafting game)
* Bid, trade, negotiate (economic game)
* Match, swap, clear (puzzle game)

### Identifying Your Core Verbs

**From your aesthetic profile:**

* **Challenge aesthetic** → Decision-making verbs (choose, evaluate, optimize)
* **Discovery aesthetic** → Information-gathering verbs (explore, examine, uncover)
* **Mastery aesthetic** → Skill-execution verbs (aim, time, combo)
* **Expression aesthetic** → Creative verbs (build, design, customize)
* **Fellowship aesthetic** → Social verbs (cooperate, communicate, coordinate)
* **Narrative aesthetic** → Choice verbs (decide, confront, respond)
* **Horror aesthetic** → Vulnerability verbs (hide, escape, endure)

**From your scaffold architecture:**

* **Loop-based** → Repeated action verbs (what micro loop does)
* **Narrative arc** → Interaction verbs (what beats consist of)
* **Puzzle** → Problem-solving verbs (manipulate, solve, deduce)
* **Exploration** → Navigation verbs (move, discover, unlock)

### How Many Core Verbs?

**Guideline: 3-7 core verbs maximum**

Too few (\<3): Game feels shallow, limited
Too many (>7): Cognitive overload, unclear focus

**Complexity by player profile:**

* Casual: 3-4 core verbs
* Midcore: 4-6 core verbs
* Hardcore: 5-7 core verbs (can handle more)

### Worked Example: Murder Mystery TTRPG

**From Aesthetics:**

* Discovery → information-gathering verbs
* Challenge (deduction) → reasoning verbs
* Fellowship → social verbs

**Core Verbs Identified:**

1. **Investigate** - Search locations for physical evidence
2. **Interview** - Question witnesses and suspects
3. **Deduce** - Connect clues and form theories
4. **Challenge** - Confront lies with evidence
5. **Theorize** - Discuss with other players (collaborate)

**Why these five:**

* Cover all aspects of investigation
* Support Discovery aesthetic (1, 2, 3)
* Support Challenge aesthetic (3, 4)
* Support Fellowship aesthetic (5)
* Manageable number (5 = good for adults)

**What we didn't include:**

* Combat/fighting (not investigation-focused)
* Skill checks (system verb, not player verb)
* Resource management (no crafting/economy)

***

## Step 3.2: Design System Elements

### What Are System Elements?

System elements are the designed rules that govern how core verbs work. They're what you program (in video games) or write down (in tabletop games).

**System elements answer:**

* HOW do players perform core verbs?
* WHAT happens when they do?
* WHAT constraints exist?
* WHAT feedback occurs?

### Mapping Aesthetics to System Elements

Different aesthetics require different system elements:

**Challenge Aesthetic Needs:**

* Meaningful decisions (multiple viable options)
* Clear consequences (choices matter)
* Skill differentiation (better play = better outcomes)
* Fair failure (lose because of decisions, not randomness)

**Discovery Aesthetic Needs:**

* Hidden information (things to find)
* Revelation systems (how information is uncovered)
* Surprising connections (aha! moments)
* Breadcrumb trails (one discovery leads to another)

**Mastery Aesthetic Needs:**

* Skill curves (easy to learn, hard to master)
* Tight feedback (responsive controls)
* Optimization space (multiple paths to mastery)
* Visible improvement (can see yourself getting better)

**Horror Aesthetic Needs:**

* Vulnerability systems (player can be harmed/lose)
* Dread mechanics (anticipation of consequences)
* Limited control (can't solve everything)
* Consequences that matter (permanent or costly)

**Narrative Aesthetic Needs:**

* Choice points (player agency)
* Consequence tracking (choices remembered)
* Character systems (who are you?)
* Relationship systems (how NPCs react)

### System Element Design Principles

**1. Serve Your Aesthetics**
Every system element must justify itself by serving primary aesthetics. If it doesn't, cut it.

**2. Minimize Complexity**
Simpler systems create space for aesthetic experience. Complex systems compete with aesthetics for cognitive load.

**3. Make Consequences Clear**
Players should understand what their actions do. Mystery in outcomes is usually bad (unless Discovery aesthetic).

**4. Avoid False Choices**
Every option should be potentially valid. "Obvious best choice" is a failed system element.

**5. Support Player Intent**
System should help players do what they want, not fight them.

### Worked Example: Murder Mystery System Elements

**Core Verb: Investigate (search location for evidence)**

**System Element Design:**

**Automatic Clue Discovery:**

* IF player searches relevant location
* THEN they find core clues (no roll required)
* Specificity affects detail, not success

**Why:**

* Discovery aesthetic: Finding clues is the game
* Challenge aesthetic: Deduction is challenge, not finding
* Avoids frustration: Can't get stuck because missed roll
* Serves investigation focus: System doesn't block story

**Implementation:**

```
Player: "I search the desk."
GM: "You find threatening letters signed 'M' and a ledger showing payments."
[No roll needed - they searched desk, clues are there]

Player: "I examine the letters more closely."
GM: "The handwriting is elegant, feminine. The paper is expensive."
[Still no roll - examining what they found]

Player: "I check if there are any hidden compartments in the desk."
GM: "Good thinking. Roll Investigation."
[Roll for HIDDEN clue, not core clue]
```

**Core Verb: Interview (question suspects)**

**System Element: Layered Secrets**

Each NPC has multiple layers:

* **Public Story:** What they claim openly
* **First Secret:** What they're hiding (revealed when caught in lie)
* **Second Secret:** Deeper truth (revealed with more evidence)
* **The Truth:** Actual involvement

**Why:**

* Discovery aesthetic: Peeling back layers is revealing
* Challenge aesthetic: Must catch lies with evidence
* Supports complexity: Everyone has secrets (not just killer)
* Creates fair play: Each layer has evidence trail

**Implementation:**

```
Public Story (automatic):
GM (as Mrs. Pemberton): "I was in my room reading all evening."

First Secret (revealed when contradicted):
Player: "But the maid says she didn't see you after 7pm."
GM: "Very well. I went to the study at 8:30. But he was already dead!"

Second Secret (revealed with more evidence):
Player: "We found love letters signed M.P. That's you."
GM: [Breaks down] "Yes, we had an affair. I needed those letters back."

The Truth (revealed with full evidence):
Player: "The butler saw you leaving at 8:45, but the body was warm at 9pm."
GM: "Oh thank god. Yes, I left him alive. Someone else killed him after I left."
```

**Core Verb: Challenge (confront with evidence)**

**System Element: Evidence-Based Confrontation**

* Players can challenge any NPC statement
* IF have contradicting evidence THEN NPC must respond
* NPC responses: Admit and explain, revise story, or double down
* No roll to challenge (you either have evidence or don't)

**Why:**

* Challenge aesthetic: Logic and evidence, not dice
* Discovery aesthetic: Pursuing truth, not persuading
* Player agency: System doesn't decide if they "succeed"
* Fair play: Evidence works or it doesn't

**Implementation:**

```
Player: "You said you were in the garden at 9pm."
NPC: "Yes, that's correct."

Player: "But the footprints in the garden are size 10 boots. You wear size 7."
[This is evidence - system forces response]

GM (as NPC): [Must choose response based on character psychology]
Option A: "You're right, I wasn't in the garden. I lied because..."
Option B: "I was there earlier, someone else made those prints later."
Option C: "Those are my husband's boots, I borrowed them because..."

[No roll - logic determines outcome]
```

**System Element: Time Pressure (Abstract)**

* Investigation has limited time (abstract, not counted precisely)
* Some actions "take time" (forces prioritization)
* Creates decision: Interview suspect A OR search location B?

**Why:**

* Challenge aesthetic: Resource scarcity creates decisions
* Pacing tool: Prevents exhaustive searching of everything
* Maintains tension: Can't do everything perfectly
* Not punitive: Time is flexible, GM-managed

**Implementation:**

```
GM: "You have the evening to investigate before the killer escapes."

Player: "I want to interview all five suspects in detail."
GM: "That would take hours. You probably have time for two or three in depth, 
or quick questions with all of them. What's your priority?"

[Forces meaningful choice without precise time tracking]
```

### Choosing Between System Elements

**When you have multiple options, choose based on:**

**1. Which serves aesthetics better?**
Example: Roll to find clues vs. automatic finding

* Roll = Challenge through randomness (not what we want)
* Automatic = Challenge through deduction (matches aesthetic)
  → Choose automatic

**2. Which is simpler?**
Example: Complex lie detection vs. evidence-based challenge

* Complex = Track suspicion levels, roll vs. NPC's deception
* Simple = Have evidence or don't, NPC responds logically
  → Choose simple (unless complexity serves aesthetic)

**3. Which gives players more agency?**
Example: GM decides if you find clue vs. players always find if they look

* GM decides = Players feel powerless
* Players find = Players feel competent
  → Choose player agency (for Discovery aesthetic)

**4. Which is more transparent?**
Example: Hidden formulas vs. visible calculations

* Hidden = Players can't predict outcomes
* Visible = Players can plan strategically
  → Choose visible (unless surprise is the point)

***

## Step 3.3: Design Resource Systems

### What Are Resources?

Resources are trackable quantities that players manage. They can be:

* **Tangible:** HP, mana, gold, items
* **Abstract:** Time, reputation, suspicion
* **Informational:** Clues, knowledge, relationships

Reference the Resource Management chapters for detailed treatment.

### Resource Types and Functions

**Limiters (Create Scarcity and Tension):**

* Health/lives (can you survive?)
* Action points/moves (can you do enough?)
* Time (can you finish in time?)

**Currencies (Enable Choice and Trade-offs):**

* Money (what to buy?)
* Experience (what to upgrade?)
* Materials (what to craft?)

**Trackers (Show Progress and State):**

* Quest completion (how far along?)
* Map exploration (where have I been?)
* Relationship levels (who trusts me?)

**Meta-Resources (Cross-Session Persistence):**

* Unlocks (what's available?)
* Skill points (how am I specialized?)
* Collection progress (what have I found?)

### How Many Resources?

**Golden Rule: 3-5 resources maximum**

Why?

* Fewer = easy to track, but limited decisions
* More = rich decisions, but cognitive overload

**By player profile:**

* Casual: 2-4 resources (simple tracking)
* Midcore: 3-5 resources (moderate complexity)
* Hardcore: 4-6 resources (can handle more)

**By aesthetic:**

* Challenge: Need meaningful scarcity (multiple limiting resources)
* Discovery: Fewer resources, more information tracking
* Mastery: Resources for optimization and builds
* Narrative: Minimal resources, focus on story

### Resource Design Questions

For each resource, define:

**1. What is it?**

* Tangible or abstract?
* Measured in numbers or states?

**2. What's its function?**

* Limiter, currency, tracker, or meta?
* What decisions does it create?

**3. How scarce/abundant?**

* Always limited (creates tension)?
* Renewable (can recover)?
* Permanent (no recovery)?

**4. How does it flow?**

* How gained?
* How spent?
* How lost?

**5. How does it interact with other resources?**

* Can convert A to B?
* Does A limit B?
* Independent or linked?

### Worked Example: Murder Mystery Resources

**Resource Count: 3 (minimal - investigation is the content)**

**Resource 1: Time (Abstract Pressure)**

* **Type:** Limiter (abstract)
* **Function:** Forces prioritization
* **Scarcity:** Limited but not counted precisely
* **Flow:**
  * Start: "You have the evening to investigate"
  * Spent: Some actions "take significant time"
  * Lost: Can't do everything exhaustively
* **Interaction:** Affects which leads you can follow

**Why this works:**

* Creates Challenge (must prioritize)
* Doesn't distract from Discovery (not tracking numbers)
* GM-managed (flexible to story needs)

**Resource 2: Evidence (Accumulating Knowledge)**

* **Type:** Currency/Tracker hybrid
* **Function:** Enables confrontations, shows progress
* **Scarcity:** Abundant (want players to find clues)
* **Flow:**
  * Gained: Through investigation
  * Spent: Used to challenge lies
  * Persists: Clues don't disappear
* **Interaction:** More evidence = more options for challenges

**Why this works:**

* Supports Discovery (finding is rewarding)
* Supports Challenge (evidence creates logic puzzles)
* Tangible (physical cards players can examine)

**Resource 3: Leads (Directional Tracker)**

* **Type:** Tracker
* **Function:** Shows investigation paths
* **Scarcity:** Generated by discoveries
* **Flow:**
  * Gained: Each clue suggests new leads
  * Spent: Following a lead (time cost)
  * Some close: Dead ends revealed as dead ends
* **Interaction:** Time limits which leads you pursue

**Why this works:**

* Prevents aimless wandering (always have direction)
* Creates decisions (which lead to follow?)
* Supports Discovery (breadcrumb trail)

**Resources We Didn't Include:**

**No HP/Health:**

* Not a combat game
* Not survival horror
* Would distract from investigation

**No Character Stats:**

* Not a progression game
* One-shot means no advancement
* Investigation is about clues, not character ability

**No Money/Economy:**

* No purchasing decisions
* Would add complexity without serving aesthetic

**No Relationship Points:**

* NPC reactions are played, not calculated
* Tracking numbers would make it gamey
* GM judges based on player approach

***

## Step 3.4: Set Initial Parameters

### What Are Parameters?

Parameters are the numeric values and ranges that define your system:

* HP amounts, damage values
* Action costs, resource limits
* Probabilities, success thresholds
* Timing values, duration lengths

Reference "From Principles to Numbers" chapters for detailed measurables.

### From Aesthetics to Numbers

Your aesthetic goals map to target numbers:

**Challenge Aesthetic:**

* Target win rate (50-80% depending on desired difficulty)
* Failure tolerance (how many mistakes allowed?)
* Decision count per session (meaningful choices)
* Time pressure (if applicable)

**Discovery Aesthetic:**

* Content variety (how many unique discoveries?)
* Revelation pacing (how often do players discover something?)
* Hidden percentage (what % of content is secret?)
* Breadcrumb density (how often does one clue lead to another?)

**Mastery Aesthetic:**

* Skill ceiling (how much room to improve?)
* Mastery time (hours to achieve competency)
* Optimization space (how many viable builds/strategies?)

**Completion Aesthetic:**

* Session length (can complete in available time?)
* Progress visibility (how often do players see advancement?)
* Goal clarity (how obvious is the objective?)

### Parameter Setting Process

**Step 1: Identify Measurables**
What numbers does your game need?

**Step 2: Map Aesthetics to Targets**
What should those numbers be to create desired experience?

**Step 3: Set Initial Values**
Educated guesses based on aesthetic targets

**Step 4: Define Tuning Ranges**
Min/max acceptable values for later iteration

### Worked Example: Murder Mystery Parameters

**For TTRPG Investigation (Fewer Numeric Parameters):**

**Scene Structure Parameters:**

**Crime Scene Clues:**

* Core clues: 5-7 (must be findable)
* Supporting clues: 2-3 (add depth)
* Hidden clues: 1-2 (optional, for thorough investigation)
* Total per location: 7-12 clues

**Why these numbers:**

* 5-7 core = enough to solve, not overwhelming
* 2-3 supporting = adds richness without bloat
* 1-2 hidden = rewards thoroughness, not required

**Per Suspect:**

* Secrets: 2-3 layers (Public → First → Second → Truth)
* Evidence pieces: 3-5 (enough to build case)
* Contradictions: 1-2 (ways to catch them lying)

**Why these numbers:**

* 2-3 secrets = depth without confusion
* 3-5 evidence = need multiple pieces to convict
* 1-2 contradictions = catchable but not obvious

**Total Suspects:**

* Minimum: 3 (need multiple possibilities)
* Ideal: 4-5 (interesting but trackable)
* Maximum: 6 (more = too complex for one session)

**Why these numbers:**

* \<3 = too obvious
* 4-5 = sweet spot for adult mystery fans
* > 6 = cognitive overload, can't track everyone

**Timeline Parameters:**

**Investigation Window:**

* Key events: 5-7 critical moments
* Time window: 2-3 hours (before/during/after murder)
* Suspect movements: Account for each suspect during window

**Why these numbers:**

* 5-7 events = complex enough for mystery
* 2-3 hours = trackable by players
* Full accounting = fair play (all alibis checkable)

**Difficulty Calibration:**

**For Adult Mystery Fans (Medium-Hard Difficulty):**

* Red herrings: 2-3 total (interesting, not padding)
* Misdirections: 1-2 (make wrong suspect viable)
* Confirming clues for truth: 5-7 (need multiple to be certain)
* Difficulty: Should take 60-80% of available session time

**Why these numbers:**

* 2-3 red herrings = enough to mislead, not frustrate
* 1-2 misdirections = makes mystery interesting
* 5-7 confirming = high confidence when solved
* 60-80% time = feels challenging but achievable

**Roll Probabilities (When Used):**

**2d6 System:**

* 10+ (Full Success): 28% probability
* 7-9 (Success with complication): 44% probability
* 6- (Failure/complication): 28% probability

**Why this curve:**

* Most outcomes (72%) are success or partial success
* Failure possible (28%) but not punishing
* Supports Discovery (usually find something)
* Adds interest (complications create story)

**When Rolls Happen:**

* Core clues: Never (automatic)
* Supporting details: Rarely (only if time-limited)
* Hidden clues: Sometimes (bonus content)
* Speed/depth: Occasionally (how long does this take?)

***

## Step 3.5: System Completeness Check

Before moving to Phase 4, verify your system is complete:

### Core Verbs Coverage

* [ ] Every primary aesthetic has supporting verbs
* [ ] Verbs cover all player actions in scaffold architecture
* [ ] No verb is redundant (each serves unique purpose)
* [ ] Players can intuit verbs from game context
* [ ] Verb count within cognitive budget (3-7 max)

### System Elements Coverage

* [ ] Every core verb has governing system elements
* [ ] System elements serve aesthetics (not arbitrary complexity)
* [ ] Elements are as simple as possible while serving goals
* [ ] Consequences are clear (players know what actions do)
* [ ] No false choices (multiple viable approaches)

### Resource System Coverage

* [ ] Resource count within guidelines (3-5 for most games)
* [ ] Each resource serves clear purpose (limiter, currency, tracker)
* [ ] Resource scarcity/abundance matches aesthetic goals
* [ ] Resources interact meaningfully (if they interact)
* [ ] No resources that just add bookkeeping without decisions

### Parameter Coverage

* [ ] All necessary numeric values defined
* [ ] Values mapped to aesthetic targets
* [ ] Tuning ranges identified (min/max acceptable)
* [ ] Difficulty appropriate for player profile
* [ ] If using dice/probability: Outcomes support aesthetics

### Common Issues to Catch

**"System Bloat" Problem:**

* Too many system elements competing for attention
* Solution: Cut anything not directly serving primary aesthetic

**"Missing Feedback" Problem:**

* Players don't know if their actions worked
* Solution: Add clear outcome indicators for each verb

**"Resource Overload" Problem:**

* More than 5-7 resources to track
* Solution: Combine similar resources or cut non-essential ones

**"Parameter Guessing" Problem:**

* No rationale for numeric values chosen
* Solution: Map parameters to aesthetic goals, use measurables

**"Complexity Without Purpose" Problem:**

* System elements are intricate but don't enhance experience
* Solution: Simplify or cut - complexity must earn its cost

***

## Special Considerations by Medium

### Video Games

* System elements must be programmable (precise rules)
* Feedback must be immediate (visual/audio)
* Parameters need precise numeric values
* Can handle more complexity (computer calculates)

### Tabletop RPGs

* System elements must be human-executable
* GM interprets and adapts rules
* Parameters can be ranges (GM judgment)
* Must be simple enough to remember

### Board Games

* System elements must be physically representable
* Components and space are constraints
* Parameters must work with discrete pieces
* No hidden information calculation (players see everything)

***

## Output from Phase 3

You should now have:

**Complete System Specification:**

1. **Core Verbs** (3-7 verbs)
   * Listed explicitly
   * Mapped to aesthetics
   * Within cognitive budget

2. **System Elements**
   * Rules for each core verb
   * How actions resolve
   * Constraints and limitations
   * Feedback mechanisms

3. **Resources** (3-5 resources)
   * Type and function of each
   * Scarcity/abundance
   * Flow (gain/spend/lose)
   * Interactions between resources

4. **Parameters**
   * Numeric values or ranges
   * Mapped to aesthetic targets
   * Tuning ranges identified
   * Difficulty calibrated

**Example Complete Phase 3 Output:**

```

***

## Moving to Phase 4

With your system elements, resources, and parameters defined, you're ready to specify content requirements and integrate thematic context.

Phase 4 will determine:

* How much content you need (quantity calculation)
* How to create that content (procedural vs. authored)
* How to integrate theme/setting (Build/Suggest/Omit)
* What information architecture players need

Your Phase 3 decisions inform Phase 4:

* Your core verbs determine what content you need (locations to investigate, NPCs to interview)
* Your resources determine content consumption rate (how fast do players burn through content?)
* Your parameters give you target quantities (how many suspects? how many clues?)

Proceed to Phase 4 when ready.
