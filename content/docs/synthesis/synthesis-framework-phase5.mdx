# The Design Framework: Phase 5 - Validation & Iteration

## Part 8: Phase 5 - Validation & Iteration

### Does This Actually Work?

You've completed Phases 1-4. You have a complete design specification:

* Defined aesthetics and player profile
* Chosen scaffold architecture
* Selected specific mechanics and resources
* Calculated content needs and integrated setting

Now comes the critical question: **Does this design actually work?**

Phase 5 provides three validation layers before implementation:

1. **Coherence Audit** - Does everything fit together logically?
2. **Dynamics Prediction** - What patterns will emerge from these mechanics?
3. **Paper Playtest** - Can you simulate this design before building it?

And one iteration framework:
4\. **Iteration Protocol** - When something's wrong, what level do you fix?

### The Cost of Skipping Validation

Implementing an unvalidated design leads to:

* **Wasted development time** - Building systems that don't work
* **Unclear problems** - Not knowing what to fix when playtests fail
* **Expensive pivots** - Discovering fundamental issues late
* **Scope creep** - Adding mechanics to fix problems that shouldn't exist

Validation catches problems when they're cheap to fix: on paper, not in code or physical components.

### What Validation Cannot Do

Validation cannot:

* Replace actual playtesting (it prepares you for effective testing)
* Guarantee fun (execution still matters)
* Predict all edge cases (players are creative)
* Eliminate all iteration (some problems only emerge in practice)

But validation dramatically improves your odds of building something that works.

## Step 5.1: Coherence Audit

### What Is Coherence?

A coherent design is one where every element supports the aesthetic goals and nothing contradicts them. Coherence means:

* **Aesthetic Coherence** - All mechanics serve the primary aesthetic
* **Structural Coherence** - Loop scales (or narrative beats) connect properly
* **Thematic Coherence** - Setting and mechanics reinforce each other
* **Cognitive Coherence** - Total load fits player capacity

Incoherent designs feel scattered, confusing, or internally contradictory. Players sense something's "off" even if they can't articulate what.

### Aesthetic Coherence Check

**Core Question:** Does every system element serve your primary aesthetic?

**The Audit:**

For each mechanic, resource, and major design element, ask:

* [ ] **What aesthetic does this serve?** (If you can't answer, it might not belong)
* [ ] **Does this support the primary aesthetic?** (Essential test)
* [ ] **Does this fight against the primary aesthetic?** (Immediate red flag)
* [ ] **Could the game work without this?** (If yes, consider cutting)

**Example: Challenge + Completion Mobile Puzzle**

✓ **Limited moves per puzzle** - Serves Challenge (creates tension, requires planning)
✓ **Progress percentage display** - Serves Completion (shows distance to goal)
✓ **Hint system** - Serves both (reduces frustration blocking Completion, maintains Challenge)
✗ **Daily streak bonuses** - Serves neither primary aesthetic (could cut or make optional)
✗ **Timed mode** - Fights Completion (adds pressure when goal is closure)

**Red Flags:**

* "This mechanic is cool but I'm not sure why it's here"
* "Players might like this feature" (if it doesn't serve aesthetic, it's distraction)
* "Other games in this genre have it" (genre convention isn't justification)
* "We spent a lot of time on it" (sunk cost fallacy)

**What About Secondary Aesthetics?**

Secondary aesthetics can justify mechanics that don't serve the primary, but:

* They should support, not compete with primary
* They should not demand equal cognitive load
* They should enhance, not dilute the core experience

**Example: Horror + Discovery TTRPG**

* Primary: Horror (complicity, dread)
* Secondary: Discovery (uncovering truth)
* Fellowship (emergent from group play, not designed-for)

✓ **Exploitation tracking** - Serves Horror (consequences), Discovery (reveals truth)
✓ **Information reveals** - Serves Discovery primarily, Horror secondarily
✗ **Combat system** - Would serve neither (cuts both if added)
✗ **Character optimization** - Would fight Horror (power fantasy contradicts vulnerability)

**Decision Point:** Can you justify every major element by reference to your aesthetic goals?

### Structural Coherence Check

**Core Question:** Do your temporal elements connect properly?

**For Loop-Based Designs:**

Check each loop scale:

* [ ] **Micro loop**: Does success here feel immediately satisfying?
* [ ] **Micro → Meso**: Does micro success contribute to meso progress?
* [ ] **Meso loop**: Does completing this feel meaningfully rewarding?
* [ ] **Meso → Macro**: Does meso success contribute to macro progress?
* [ ] **Macro loop**: Does long-term progression feel worth pursuing?

**Example: Roguelike Structure**

* Micro (combat encounter): Kill enemy → get resources/XP
* Meso (single run): Progress through dungeon → unlock new content OR learn for next run
* Macro (meta-progression): Multiple runs → permanent unlocks, increased mastery

✓ Each scale contributes to the next
✓ Failure at meso provides macro value (learning, unlocks)
✓ Players can see connection between scales

**For Narrative Arc Designs:**

Check act structure:

* [ ] **Act 1**: Does it establish stakes and investment?
* [ ] **Act 1 → 2**: Do complications emerge from Act 1 choices?
* [ ] **Act 2**: Does tension escalate appropriately?
* [ ] **Act 2 → 3**: Does revelation feel earned and surprising?
* [ ] **Act 3**: Does resolution address what was set up?

**Example: Horror One-Shot**

* Act 1: Players make colonial decisions (optimistic, justified)
* Act 2: Consequences manifest, information reveals complicity
* Act 3: Full truth revealed, players confront what they've done

✓ Each act builds on previous
✓ Information reveals recontextualize earlier actions
✓ Resolution is inevitable consequence of choices

**For Puzzle/Exploration Designs:**

Check progression gating:

* [ ] **Early puzzles**: Teach core concepts clearly?
* [ ] **Mid puzzles**: Build on early concepts without overwhelming?
* [ ] **Late puzzles**: Combine concepts in interesting ways?
* [ ] **Difficulty curve**: Appropriate to player skill growth?
* [ ] **Optional content**: Clearly signaled as optional?

**Red Flags:**

* "Meso loop doesn't really lead anywhere" (missing macro, or meso needs rework)
* "Players might skip the micro loop" (micro doesn't contribute to meso)
* "This part feels disconnected" (structural incoherence)
* "Act 2 could be skipped" (acts don't build on each other)

**Decision Point:** Does your temporal structure hold together, or are there disconnected pieces?

### Thematic Coherence Check

**Core Question:** Do mechanics and setting reinforce each other, or fight?

**The "Space Coffee" Test:**

Space Coffee is when theme contradicts mechanics. Named for "a coffee shop, but in space!"—where "in space" doesn't change anything meaningful about the coffee shop experience.

**Examples of Space Coffee:**

* Horror theme but mechanics reward power fantasy
* Peaceful theme but core loop is combat
* Narrative-focused setting but no meaningful choices
* "Realistic" setting but arcade-style mechanics

**Examples of Thematic Coherence:**

* Horror game where mechanics create vulnerability (setting and systems align)
* Puzzle game with abstract theme (no theme conflict, pure mechanics)
* Colonial horror TTRPG where "success" mechanics reward exploitation (theme IS the mechanics)

**The Audit:**

If you have a setting/theme (not abstract):

* [ ] **Do players intuit mechanics from theme?** (Good coherence)
* [ ] **Does theme explain why mechanics exist?** (Setting justifies systems)
* [ ] **Do mechanics create the emotional tone of setting?** (Systems create atmosphere)
* [ ] **Could this setting work with different mechanics?** (If easily, might be space coffee)
* [ ] **Could these mechanics work with different setting?** (If no, very coherent; if yes, setting might be decoration)

**When Theme and Mechanics Fight:**

**Option 1: Change Theme**

* Easier than changing mechanics (usually)
* Abstract it or pick better-fitting theme
* Example: Combat-heavy game trying to be peaceful → Make it about training/competition instead

**Option 2: Change Mechanics**

* Harder but sometimes necessary
* Ensure new mechanics serve aesthetics
* Example: Horror game with power fantasy mechanics → Reduce player power, increase vulnerability

**Option 3: Accept Incoherence (Rarely Right)**

* Only if the benefits outweigh the confusion
* Must be intentional and justified
* Example: Comedy games that deliberately subvert expectations

**Decision Point:** Do your theme and mechanics work together, or should one of them change?

### Cognitive Coherence Check

**Core Question:** Does your total cognitive load fit within your player profile's budget?

**The Budget Audit:**

From Phase 2, you allocated cognitive load. Now verify:

* [ ] **Total within budget?** (Casual = 3-5 elements, Midcore = 5-7, Hardcore = 7+)
* [ ] **Priority elements get most space?** (Aesthetics determine priority)
* [ ] **Complexity ramps appropriately?** (Tutorial → Full game)
* [ ] **No unnecessary complexity?** (Each element justified)

**Example: Casual Mobile Puzzle (Budget: 3-5 elements)**

Current allocation:

* Grid state (what tiles where): 2 elements (high priority - core challenge)
* Moves remaining: 1 element (high priority - creates tension)
* Goal pattern: 1 element (high priority - defines success)
* Hint system: 0.5 element (low priority - optional tool)
* Cosmetic unlocks: 0.5 element (low priority - optional engagement)

Total: 5 elements ✓ (within budget)
Distribution: Core challenge gets 4/5 of budget ✓ (appropriate priority)

**If Over Budget:**

* Cut lowest-priority elements first
* Combine related systems (reduce tracking)
* Simplify mechanics (fewer variables per system)
* Adjust player profile target (or accept harder game)

**Example: TTRPG One-Shot (Budget: Medium - thematic complexity acceptable)**

Current allocation:

* Narrative tracking (what happened, what we've done): Medium (necessary)
* Decision-making (weighing options): High (core activity)
* Character roles: Low (minimal mechanical difference)
* Resource tracking (Exploitation, Stability): Medium (GM-facing, players see outcomes)

Total: Medium-High ✓ (within adult capacity for serious themes)
Note: Mechanics are minimal (simple rolls), cognitive load is thematic (processing complicity)

**Red Flags:**

* "Players need to track 8+ things at once" (over budget for most profiles)
* "Tutorial takes 30+ minutes" (probably too complex for target)
* "Players keep forgetting this rule" (exceeds working memory)
* "You need to read this guide" (complexity requiring external reference)

**Decision Point:** Is your design cognitively feasible for your target players?

### Complete Coherence Audit Checklist

Before proceeding, verify:

* [ ] Every major mechanic serves aesthetic goals
* [ ] No mechanics fight against primary aesthetic
* [ ] Temporal structure connects properly (loops or acts)
* [ ] Theme and mechanics reinforce each other (or abstracted theme)
* [ ] Total cognitive load within player profile budget
* [ ] Complexity priorities match aesthetic priorities
* [ ] Nothing included "just because" or "because genre expects it"

**If any checks fail:** Address them now before predicting dynamics. Incoherent designs produce unpredictable (often bad) dynamics.

***

## Step 5.2: Dynamics Prediction

### What Are Dynamics?

Dynamics are the patterns that emerge when players interact with your mechanics. They're what actually happens during play—the strategies, social interactions, optimization patterns, and emotional experiences that emerge from your rules.

**Mechanics** are what you design (the rules).
**Dynamics** are what players create (the patterns).
**Aesthetics** are what players feel (the experiences).

You design mechanics hoping they create dynamics that produce aesthetics. This step predicts whether that chain will work.

### Why Predict Dynamics?

Because dynamics determine whether your aesthetics are achieved:

* Good dynamics → Intended aesthetics emerge
* Bad dynamics → Unintended or missing aesthetics
* Exploitable dynamics → Trivialize challenge
* Confusing dynamics → Cognitive overload
* Toxic dynamics → Social harm (multiplayer)

You can predict many dynamics before implementation by thinking through how rational players would interact with your mechanics.

### The Dynamics Checklist

These checklists help predict likely dynamics based on your architecture type.

#### For Loop-Based Games

**Micro Loop Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Does micro loop success contribute to meso progress?**
  * If NO: Players will skip or minimize micro engagement
  * Example: Combat encounters that don't reward resources → players avoid combat

* [ ] **Does micro loop have immediate feedback?**
  * If NO: Players won't know if they're succeeding
  * Example: Actions with delayed or unclear outcomes → confusion

* [ ] **Can players improve at micro loop through skill/knowledge?**
  * If NO for Mastery aesthetic: Missing core appeal
  * If YES for Completion aesthetic: May create frustration for casual players

* [ ] **Is micro loop length appropriate for context?**
  * Too long: Interruption problems (mobile), attention issues (casual)
  * Too short: Feels trivial, no investment

**Meso Loop Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Does completing meso loop feel rewarding?**
  * If NO: Players won't engage with macro loop (if exists)
  * Example: Completing a mission with no meaningful reward → hollow victory

* [ ] **Can meso loop be completed in target session length?**
  * If NO: Players can't finish anything → frustration
  * Example: 60-minute meso loop in 30-minute session game → incomplete feeling

* [ ] **Does failure at meso provide value?**
  * If NO: Failure feels punishing rather than educational
  * Value types: Information (what went wrong), Resources (consolation prize), Progress (incremental advancement)

* [ ] **Can players see connection between micro and meso?**
  * If NO: Micro feels disconnected from goals
  * Example: Collecting items that don't contribute to mission completion

**Macro Loop Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Does macro progression feel meaningful?**
  * If NO: Why play long-term?
  * Example: Unlocks that don't change gameplay → hollow progression

* [ ] **Can players see long-term goals from short-term actions?**
  * If NO: Long-term feels disconnected
  * Example: Meta-currency with unclear purpose → confusion about value

* [ ] **Does macro respect player time investment?**
  * Too slow: Feels grindy
  * Too fast: Runs out of content
  * Gated behind skill: Hardcore okay, casual frustrating

**Resource Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Do resources create interesting tensions?**
  * Multiple resources → choice (spend X or Y?)
  * Scarcity → planning (use now or later?)
  * Abundance → experimentation (try different approaches)

* [ ] **Are there dominant strategies?**
  * One resource always better → others ignored
  * One approach always optimal → no variety
  * Early game strategy dominates → no progression

* [ ] **Do resources enable or constrain?**
  * Limiters (HP, moves) → create tension through scarcity
  * Currencies (gold, XP) → create choice through allocation
  * Both needed for interesting decisions

**Example: Daily Puzzle Game Dynamics Check**

Micro (single puzzle attempt):
✓ Success contributes to meso (completing daily puzzle)
✓ Immediate feedback (remaining moves, current state)
✓ Can improve through pattern recognition
✓ 2-3 min length appropriate for mobile

Meso (daily puzzle completion):
✓ Feels rewarding (solved the puzzle)
✓ Completes in 5-20 min (within target)
✓ Failure provides value (can retry, learn patterns)
✓ Clear connection (attempts contribute to completion)

Macro (none in this design):
N/A - Daily puzzle has no macro loop
✓ Intentional - casual players, no long-term commitment expected

Resources:
✓ Moves create tension (limited, must plan)
✓ Hints provide safety valve (reduces frustration)
✗ Potential dominant strategy: Always use hints early
→ Solution: Limit hints more strictly OR make puzzles solvable without hints

#### For Narrative Arc Games

**Decision Point Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Do early decisions have consequences later?**
  * If NO: Choices feel meaningless
  * Example: Dialogue choices that don't affect story → illusion of choice

* [ ] **Are there meaningful choices (not just "good vs. evil")?**
  * If NO: Optimal path is obvious
  * Example: "Kill innocent or spare" with obvious moral answer → no tension

* [ ] **Can players see tradeoffs at decision time?**
  * If NO: Choices feel arbitrary
  * If YES: Creates satisfying strategic layer
  * Balance: Too clear → no surprise; Too hidden → frustration

* [ ] **Do player choices shape narrative meaningfully?**
  * If NO: Why offer choices?
  * Example: Branching paths that converge immediately → wasted content

**Information Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Is information revealed at appropriate pace?**
  * Too fast: No discovery satisfaction
  * Too slow: Confusion or boredom
  * Example: Horror game revealing monster in Act 1 → loses dread

* [ ] **Do revelations recontextualize previous events?**
  * If YES: Creates "aha!" moments (Discovery aesthetic)
  * Example: Revealing natives are sentient → recontextualizes all earlier "aggression"

* [ ] **Can players piece together truth before reveal?**
  * If YES for Discovery aesthetic: Satisfying
  * If NO but should be: Frustrating
  * If YES but shouldn't be: Loses surprise

**Pacing Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Does tension escalate across acts?**
  * If NO: Story feels flat
  * Example: Act 2 less intense than Act 1 → loses momentum

* [ ] **Are there moments of release/reflection?**
  * If NO: Exhausting (horror especially needs breaks)
  * Example: Relentless tension without processing → player fatigue

* [ ] **Does climax deliver on buildup?**
  * If NO: Anticlimactic
  * Example: Major threat resolved easily → disappointing

**Example: Horror TTRPG Dynamics Check**

Decision Points:
✓ Early decisions have late consequences (exploitation → revelation)
✓ Meaningful choices (no "right" answer, colonial situation is rigged)
✓ Tradeoffs visible but framed in colonial euphemisms (success requires harm)
✓ Player choices shape degree of complicity

Information:
✓ Reveals paced across acts (gradual truth emergence)
✓ Revelations recontextualize (native "aggression" revealed as defense)
✓ Players can piece together truth (evidence accumulates)

Pacing:
✓ Tension escalates (optimism → dissonance → horror)
✓ Epilogue provides processing (out-of-character discussion)
✓ Climax delivers (truth revelation is impact moment)

Potential dynamic: Players might avoid making decisions (paralysis)
→ Solution: Frame decisions as "company expects progress" (pressure to act)

#### For Puzzle/Exploration Games

**Challenge Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Does difficulty ramp appropriately?**
  * Too flat: Boring
  * Too steep: Frustrating
  * Example: Puzzle 10 easier than Puzzle 5 → confusing

* [ ] **Can players apply learned concepts to new situations?**
  * If NO: Each puzzle feels disconnected
  * If YES: Satisfying mastery growth

* [ ] **Is there a "gotcha" moment or fair challenge?**
  * Gotcha: Solution requires information player doesn't have
  * Fair: Solution is discoverable with given information

**Exploration Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Does exploration feel rewarding?**
  * Rewards: Useful items, knowledge, story, beautiful areas
  * If NO reward: Exploration feels pointless
  * Example: Empty areas with nothing to discover → wasted time

* [ ] **Are there multiple paths/approaches?**
  * If NO: Linear (okay if intentional)
  * If YES: Replayability, player expression

* [ ] **Does gating make sense?**
  * Ability-gated: Can't go there until I have tool
  * Knowledge-gated: Can go there but won't understand yet
  * Difficulty-gated: Can try but will probably fail

**Discovery Dynamics:**

* [ ] **Is there hidden content worth finding?**
  * If NO: No Discovery aesthetic
  * If YES: How much? (Balance secrets vs. required content)

* [ ] **Can players find everything, or is some missable?**
  * All findable: Completionist-friendly
  * Some missable: Creates FOMO or replayability (depending on framing)

#### Universal Dynamics Questions

Regardless of architecture, ask:

**Optimization Dynamics:**

* **What will players optimize?**
  * Time? Efficiency? Completion percentage? Score? Style?
  * Is this optimization healthy or harmful to experience?

* **Are there dominant strategies?**
  * One approach always optimal → reduced variety
  * Multiple viable approaches → interesting choices

* **Will players "solve" the game?**
  * For Challenge/Mastery: Expected and good
  * For Discovery/Narrative: Might trivialize experience

**Social Dynamics (if multiplayer):**

* **How will players interact?**
  * Cooperatively? Competitively? Indifferently?
  * Does the design encourage desired interaction?

* **What toxic behaviors might emerge?**
  * Griefing, trolling, kingmaking, rage-quitting
  * Are there systems to mitigate?

* **Will skill gaps create problems?**
  * Experts dominating novices (competition)
  * Skilled players carrying weak players (co-op)
  * Casual players feeling excluded (hardcore game)

**Grinding Dynamics:**

* **Can players grind to bypass skill requirements?**
  * If YES for Challenge aesthetic: Problem
  * If YES for casual game: Maybe okay (accessibility)

* **Does optimal play require repetitive actions?**
  * If YES: Might feel like work
  * Example: Farming resources for hours → boring

**Tutorial/Onboarding Dynamics:**

* **Can players learn by doing?**
  * Best: Integrated tutorials (learn while playing)
  * Okay: Separate tutorial (if short and clear)
  * Bad: Reading required (cognitive load before engagement)

* **Will players skip the tutorial?**
  * If YES: Is game playable without it?
  * Returning players especially skip tutorials

### Predicting Unintended Dynamics

Some dynamics only emerge in practice, but you can predict common ones:

**Economy Breaking:**

* Players find infinite resource loops
* Early game advantage snowballs uncontrollably
* Late game economy trivializes challenges

**Degenerate Strategies:**

* Optimal play is boring (but effective)
* Players optimize fun out of game
* Example: Stealth games where hiding in corner is safest

**Social Toxicity:**

* Blame mechanics (who's fault we lost?)
* Comparison systems (leaderboards creating pressure)
* Required cooperation with strangers (communication breakdown)

**Confusion Cascades:**

* Players misunderstand one rule, breaks everything else
* Tutorial inadequate for complexity
* Hidden information confuses rather than intrigues

**Content Exhaustion:**

* Players consume content faster than expected
* Optimal path discovered, variety ignored
* Procedural generation feels repetitive

**Engagement Cliffs:**

* Early game hooks but mid-game drags
* Late game only for hardcore (casual players quit)
* "Solved" game becomes repetitive

### What to Do with Predictions

**For Each Predicted Dynamic:**

**If positive (serves aesthetics):** Great! Note it as expected outcome.

**If negative (fights aesthetics):**

1. Can you prevent it? (Change mechanics)
2. Can you mitigate it? (Add guardrails)
3. Can you embrace it? (Reframe as feature)
4. Is it rare enough to ignore? (Edge case)

**If exploitable:**

* Is the exploit fun? (If yes, maybe feature not bug)
* Does it trivialize core aesthetic? (If yes, must fix)
* Will players discover it? (If unlikely, maybe acceptable)

**If toxic (multiplayer):**

* Must address before shipping
* Player behavior systems required
* Matchmaking, reporting, moderation

**Example: Predicted Exploit in Puzzle Game**

Prediction: "Players might screenshot puzzle, solve offline, enter solution"

* Positive or negative? Negative (bypasses Challenge aesthetic)
* Prevention: Time pressure? (No - fights interruption-friendly design)
* Mitigation: Track solve time, flag suspiciously fast? (Complex, invasive)
* Embrace: Okay if players want to "cheat" single-player puzzle? (Maybe)
* Rarity: How many will do this? (Probably few)
  Decision: Accept as edge case, don't design around it

***

## Step 5.3: Paper Playtest

### What Is Paper Playtesting?

Before implementing your design (coding, printing, preparing materials), simulate it mentally or on paper. Walk through actual play scenarios to identify problems.

Paper playtesting catches:

* Rules that don't work as written
* Pacing problems (too fast/slow)
* Confusion points (unclear what to do)
* Missing information (rules don't cover cases)
* Boring or frustrating moments

### How to Paper Playtest

**For Video/Board Games:**

1. **Write out rules completely** (as if for another person)
2. **Set up a sample scenario** (starting state)
3. **Play through manually:**
   * Track all resources on paper
   * Simulate all decisions (what would a player choose?)
   * Apply all rules (calculate outcomes)
   * Note time taken for each phase
4. **Track your experience:**
   * Where were you confused?
   * What felt tedious?
   * What felt satisfying?
   * Where did you want more/less information?

**For TTRPGs:**

1. **Outline complete session beat-by-beat**
2. **Write prep notes** (what GM needs ready)
3. **Identify improvisation points** (where flexibility needed)
4. **Walk through likely player decisions:**
   * What will players probably do?
   * How does GM respond?
   * What information gets revealed?
   * Does this serve the aesthetic?
5. **Check pacing:**
   * Is each act the right length?
   * Are there dead spots?
   * Is there enough content?

### Paper Playtest Protocol by Architecture

#### Loop-Based Games

**Test a Complete Session:**

**Starting scenario:**

* Player at beginning of session
* Representative difficulty (not tutorial, not endgame)
* Typical resource state

**Walk through:**

1. **First 5 minutes:**
   * Is it clear what to do?
   * Does micro loop feel good?
   * Is feedback immediate?

2. **First micro loop completion (5-10 min):**
   * Does success contribute to meso goal?
   * Is reward appropriate?
   * Do I want to continue?

3. **Mid-session (15-20 min):**
   * Am I making progress toward meso goal?
   * Is this getting boring/frustrating?
   * Are decisions still interesting?

4. **Meso loop completion (20-30 min):**
   * Does this feel satisfying?
   * What have I accomplished?
   * Would I return tomorrow?

**Track:**

* Total time taken
* Number of micro loops completed
* Resource flow (gain/spend patterns)
* Decision points encountered
* Confusion moments
* Satisfaction moments

**Example: Daily Puzzle Game Paper Playtest**

Setup: Player at Tier 2 (Medium difficulty), familiar with mechanics

Minute 0-2: See puzzle, recognize pattern type, plan approach

* Clear what to do? ✓
* Immediate engagement? ✓

Minute 2-5: First attempt, use 15 of 20 moves, 70% complete, stuck

* Micro loop feels good? ✓ (planning, seeing progress)
* Clear feedback? ✓ (progress percentage, moves remaining)

Minute 5-7: Use 1 hint, reveals optimal next move, try again

* Hint helpful? ✓
* Feels like cheating? ✗ (appropriate assistance)

Minute 7-10: Second attempt, complete in 18 moves

* Success satisfying? ✓
* Reward appropriate? Victory screen, stats, cosmetic currency
* Want to continue? ✓ (start next puzzle)

Minute 10-25: Complete 2 more puzzles (similar pattern)

* Getting boring? Slightly (similar patterns)
* Still engaging? ✓ (enough variety in execution)

Session total: 4 puzzles in 25 minutes

* Within target? ✓ (20-30 min session, 3-5 puzzles)
* Satisfying session? ✓ (completed meaningful goals)
* Return tomorrow? ✓ (new puzzles available)

**Issues identified:**

* Pattern similarity could be boring (need more variety)
* No issue with interruption (can pause between puzzles)
* Hint system works well (safety valve without trivializing)

#### Narrative Arc Games

**Test Complete Arc:**

**Walk through each act:**

**Act 1 (Setup):**

* [ ] Stakes established clearly?
* [ ] Players invested in outcomes?
* [ ] Decisions feel meaningful?
* [ ] Appropriate length? (Not rushing, not dragging)

**Act 2 (Complications):**

* [ ] Consequences from Act 1 manifest?
* [ ] Tension escalates?
* [ ] Information reveals appropriately paced?
* [ ] Players engaged with dilemmas?

**Act 3 (Climax/Resolution):**

* [ ] Major revelation lands?
* [ ] Climax earned?
* [ ] Resolution addresses setup?
* [ ] Emotionally satisfying (even if tragic)?

**Example: Horror TTRPG Paper Playtest**

Act 1 (45 min): Arrival at colony

* Minute 0-10: Setup, character roles, premise established
  * Stakes clear? ✓ (colony success)
  * Invested? ✓ (assigned roles, company expectations)

* Minute 10-25: First decision (approach natives)
  * Meaningful? ✓ (players debate, choose "peaceful contact with precautions")
  * Outcome: Natives defensive, language barrier, players frustrated
  * Exploitation Points: +2 (GM tracks secretly)

* Minute 25-40: Second decision (resource extraction vs. native territory)
  * Meaningful? ✓ (economic pressure vs. ethical concern)
  * Outcome: Players justify extraction ("they don't own it"), tension with natives
  * Exploitation Points: +3 (now at 5 total)

* Minute 40-45: Third decision (respond to native "aggression")
  * Meaningful? ✓ (defend colony vs. investigate cause)
  * Outcome: Players escalate, citing self-defense
  * Exploitation Points: +2 (at 7, triggers first major revelation)

Act 1 assessment:

* Pacing? ✓ (45 min with 3 meaningful decisions)
* Investment? ✓ (players justifying choices, engaged)
* Too obvious? ✗ (not yet realizing complicity)

Act 2 (90 min): Escalating consequences...
\[Continue through full session]

**Issues identified:**

* Act 2 might drag without crisis points (need to inject urgency)
* Players might avoid decisions (need company pressure framing)
* Final revelation needs to be clear (avoid subtlety at climax)

#### Puzzle/Exploration Games

**Test Difficulty Progression:**

**Select sample puzzles:**

* Early (tutorial level)
* Middle (representative difficulty)
* Late (hardest complexity)

**Solve each:**

* Time to solve
* Concepts required
* Stuck points
* "Aha" moments
* Satisfaction level

**Check progression:**

* [ ] Early teaches concepts needed for middle?
* [ ] Middle teaches concepts needed for late?
* [ ] Difficulty ramp feels smooth?
* [ ] No sudden spikes or dips?

### What to Look For During Paper Playtest

**Red Flags:**

**Confusion:**

* "Wait, how does this work?"
* "Am I supposed to know this?"
* "What am I trying to do here?"

**Tedium:**

* "This is taking forever"
* "Do I really need to track all this?"
* "Is this supposed to be this repetitive?"

**Frustration:**

* "This feels unfair"
* "How was I supposed to know that?"
* "I can't make any progress"

**Disconnection:**

* "Why does this matter?"
* "How does this connect to that?"
* "What's the point of this system?"

**Green Flags:**

**Engagement:**

* "Oh, interesting choice here"
* "I wonder what happens if..."
* "Let me try this approach"

**Satisfaction:**

* "Yes! I figured it out"
* "That was clever"
* "I feel accomplished"

**Flow:**

* Time passes quickly
* Clear what to do next
* Appropriate challenge level

### Recording Your Playtest

**Create a playtest log:**

```
Time | Action | Result | Notes
-----|--------|--------|-------
0:00 | Start puzzle | - | Clear goal
0:02 | First move | Progress | Satisfying
0:05 | Stuck | - | Need hint?
0:07 | Use hint | Unstuck | Good safety valve
0:10 | Complete | Victory | Felt earned
```

**Track metrics:**

* Time for each phase
* Resources gained/spent
* Decisions made
* Problems encountered
* Emotional responses

**Note patterns:**

* Where do you naturally pause?
* What do you keep forgetting?
* What do you want to skip?
* What do you wish existed?

### Common Paper Playtest Discoveries

**"This rule never comes up"**
→ Cut it, it's adding complexity for no benefit

**"I keep forgetting to track this"**
→ Too many resources, or poorly integrated

**"This is taking way longer than expected"**
→ Pacing problem, need to streamline

**"I'm just going through the motions"**
→ No interesting decisions, needs more depth

**"I'm totally lost"**
→ Information architecture problem

**"This is actually kind of boring"**
→ Core loop might not serve aesthetic

**"I want to do X but the rules don't allow it"**
→ Missing mechanic or unnecessary constraint

**"Wait, this breaks everything"**
→ Exploit discovered, needs fixing

## Step 5.4: Iteration Protocol

### When Something's Wrong, What Do You Fix?

Paper playtesting or coherence checks revealed problems. Now what?

The key insight: **Different problems require different-level solutions.**

Fixing the wrong level wastes time:

* Tuning parameters won't fix broken mechanics
* Changing mechanics won't fix wrong architecture
* Restructuring won't fix aesthetic mismatch

This protocol helps you identify the problem level and apply appropriate fixes.

### The Four Levels of Problems

**Level 1: Parameter Problems** (Surface Level)

* Numbers feel wrong
* Too easy or too hard
* Too fast or too slow
* Resource costs off

**Level 2: Mechanic Problems** (System Level)

* Rules don't create intended dynamics
* Mechanics feel disconnected
* Core loop unsatisfying
* Unintended exploits

**Level 3: Architecture Problems** (Structure Level)

* Loop structure doesn't support aesthetic
* Pacing fundamentally wrong
* Cognitive load misallocated
* Wrong scaffold for goals

**Level 4: Aesthetic Mismatch Problems** (Foundation Level)

* Wrong game for these players
* Wrong players for this game
* Aesthetic goals conflict
* Core concept doesn't work

### Diagnostic Decision Tree

When you identify a problem, work through this tree:

```
Problem identified
    ↓
Question 1: "Is it a numbers problem?"
    (Win rates, timing, costs, damage values, etc.)
    ↓
YES → Level 1: Parameter Problem
    → Tune values, adjust curves
    → Timeline: Hours to days
    → Re-test and iterate
    ↓
NO → Question 2: "Is it a mechanics problem?"
    (Rules creating wrong dynamics, exploits, confusion)
    ↓
YES → Level 2: Mechanic Problem
    → Change specific mechanics
    → Keep overall structure
    → Timeline: Days to weeks
    → Return to Phase 3
    ↓
NO → Question 3: "Is it a structure problem?"
    (Loops don't connect, pacing wrong, architecture serves wrong aesthetic)
    ↓
YES → Level 3: Architecture Problem
    → Restructure temporal elements
    → May need new mechanics
    → Timeline: Weeks to months
    → Return to Phase 2
    ↓
NO → Question 4: "Is it an aesthetic mismatch?"
    (Players can't/won't engage, core concept fails)
    ↓
YES → Level 4: Fundamental Problem
    → Change target audience OR change aesthetic goal
    → May need complete redesign
    → Timeline: Major pivot
    → Return to Phase 1 (or Phase 0)
```

### Level 1: Parameter Problems

**Symptoms:**

* "The game is too easy/hard"
* "Sessions run too long/short"
* "Resources feel too scarce/abundant"
* "Difficulty spike at level 5"
* "Early game great, late game trivial"

**Examples:**

* Puzzle solvable in 12 moves but budget is 20 (too easy)
* Combat encounter takes 10 minutes but should take 5 (too slow)
* Players accumulate 1000 gold with nothing to spend it on (too abundant)
* Boss has 500 HP but players do 50 damage (too tanky)

**How to Fix:**

1. **Identify the specific parameter** (don't guess)
   * Win rate too high? → Increase difficulty
   * Session too long? → Reduce content or speed up loops
   * Resource too scarce? → Increase drops or reduce costs

2. **Change in small increments** (10-25% at a time)
   * Don't double or halve (too drastic)
   * Test after each change
   * Document what you tried

3. **Use measurables as targets**
   * Reference Phase 1 success criteria
   * Challenge aesthetic: Target 70% win rate? Tune to hit it
   * Session length: Target 20 min? Tune content/pacing

4. **Watch for side effects**
   * Changing one parameter affects others
   * Easier puzzles might become boring (not just easier)
   * Cheaper items might trivialize economy (not just accessible)

**Timeline:** Quick iteration (hours to days)

**When to stop:** When metrics match targets and playtest feels right

**When to escalate:** If you've tuned by 50%+ and it's still wrong, probably Level 2 problem

### Level 2: Mechanic Problems

**Symptoms:**

* "This mechanic doesn't create the intended feel"
* "Players ignore this system"
* "There's an exploit where X"
* "This rule is confusing"
* "Optimal strategy is boring"

**Examples:**

* Combat mechanic intended to create tension but feels tedious
* Resource system that nobody uses (always use gold, ignore gems)
* Stealth mechanic exploitable by hiding in corner indefinitely
* Card combination rules that players can't remember
* Movement system where standing still is optimal

**How to Fix:**

1. **Identify what dynamic is wrong**
   * What's happening vs. what should happen?
   * Why are players doing X instead of Y?
   * What's the exploit or confusion?

2. **Consider mechanic changes:**
   * **Add constraint:** Prevent degenerate strategy
   * **Add incentive:** Reward desired behavior
   * **Simplify rule:** Reduce confusion
   * **Replace mechanic:** Different approach to same goal
   * **Remove mechanic:** If it's not serving aesthetic

3. **Validate against aesthetics:**
   * Does new mechanic serve aesthetic goals?
   * Does it create intended dynamics?
   * Does it stay within cognitive budget?

4. **Update related systems:**
   * Changing one mechanic affects others
   * Resources might need rebalancing
   * Other mechanics might need adjustment

**Timeline:** Moderate iteration (days to weeks)

**When to stop:** When mechanic creates intended dynamics in playtest

**When to escalate:** If multiple mechanics don't work together, probably Level 3 problem

**Example: Fixing Mechanic Problem**

Problem: "Combat is tedious"

* Symptom: Players avoid combat when possible
* Dynamic: Combat takes too long for reward given
* Not parameter: Adjusting damage/HP doesn't fix "tedious"
* Mechanic issue: Combat resolution itself is the problem

Potential fixes:

* **Streamline resolution:** Fewer steps per combat
* **Auto-resolve option:** For trivial encounters
* **Add interesting decisions:** Combat currently deterministic
* **Remove combat:** If doesn't serve aesthetic (radical but sometimes right)

Decision: Add interesting decisions (spend resources for guaranteed effects)

* Serves Challenge aesthetic (meaningful choices)
* Reduces tedium (faster with interesting moments)
* Stays within cognitive budget (resources already tracked)

### Level 3: Architecture Problems

**Symptoms:**

* "The micro loop is fine but nothing builds to anything"
* "Pacing is fundamentally off"
* "Players complete meso loop but don't continue"
* "First hour is great, then it drags"
* "Too many systems to track"

**Examples:**

* Roguelike with no meta-progression (no reason to play again after first win)
* Narrative game where Act 2 doesn't escalate from Act 1
* Puzzle game with no difficulty progression (all puzzles same complexity)
* Daily puzzle with macro loop (creating unwanted commitment pressure)
* Horror game with power progression (fighting aesthetic)

**How to Fix:**

1. **Identify structural problem:**
   * **Loop disconnection:** Scales don't connect properly
   * **Wrong architecture:** Using loops when need narrative arc (or vice versa)
   * **Pacing mismatch:** Structure doesn't serve aesthetic rhythm
   * **Cognitive misallocation:** Budget distributed wrong

2. **Consider restructuring:**
   * **Add/remove loop scale:** Might need macro, or shouldn't have one
   * **Change architecture type:** Loops → narrative arc, or vice versa
   * **Redistribute cognitive load:** Simplify one area, deepen another
   * **Rebalance loop lengths:** Micro too long, meso too short, etc.

3. **Validate against aesthetics:**
   * Does new structure serve aesthetic goals?
   * Does it fit player profile?
   * Does it work in target context?

4. **Expect mechanic changes:**
   * New architecture might need different mechanics
   * Resources might need redesign
   * Content needs recalculation

**Timeline:** Major iteration (weeks to months)

**When to stop:** When structure supports aesthetics and playtest confirms

**When to escalate:** If no structure works, probably Level 4 problem

**Example: Fixing Architecture Problem**

Problem: "Daily puzzle game feels like a chore"

* Players complete puzzle, but reluctant to return daily
* Metric: 30% return rate (low)
* Not parameter: Puzzle difficulty is appropriate
* Not mechanic: Puzzles are satisfying to solve
* Architecture issue: Daily commitment creates pressure (fights Completion aesthetic)

Analysis:

* Completion aesthetic wants closure, not obligation
* Daily refresh creates FOMO
* Macro loop (streaks) adds pressure
* Structure doesn't fit "busy adult" context (unpredictable schedule)

Restructure:

* **Remove daily gate:** Puzzles available on-demand
* **Remove streaks:** No penalty for not playing daily
* **Keep content fresh:** New puzzles added regularly but accessible anytime
* **Add optional meta:** Statistics visible but no pressure to optimize

Result: Same puzzles, different architecture

* Compressed loops remain (micro + meso)
* But meso available anytime (not daily)
* Fits busy adult context better (play when possible)
* Serves Completion aesthetic (finish when ready, no external pressure)

### Level 4: Aesthetic Mismatch Problems

**Symptoms:**

* "Players fundamentally don't engage"
* "Core concept doesn't resonate"
* "Target audience rejects premise"
* "Aesthetics conflict irreconcilably"
* "Even when 'working,' it's not fun"

**Examples:**

* Horror game for young children (aesthetic doesn't fit audience)
* Complex strategy game for casual mobile (cognitive mismatch)
* Competitive game requiring cooperation (aesthetic conflict)
* Educational game that lectures (violates "show don't tell")
* Game about serious topic treated lightly (tone mismatch)

**How to Fix:**

This is a **pivot decision**, not iteration. You have three options:

**Option 1: Change Target Audience**

* Keep aesthetic goals, find different players
* Example: Casual game is too complex → Target midcore instead
* Easier than changing aesthetics
* But: Market might be smaller/different

**Option 2: Change Aesthetic Goals**

* Keep target audience, create different experience
* Example: Horror too intense for audience → Make it suspenseful instead
* Might require significant redesign
* But: Audience is validated

**Option 3: Accept Failure and Start Over**

* Core concept doesn't work
* No amount of tuning will fix
* Return to Phase 0 with new concept
* Hardest emotionally but sometimes necessary

**Timeline:** Major pivot or restart

**When to choose this level:** Only when all other levels have been exhausted

**Example: Recognizing Level 4 Problem**

Problem: "Colonial horror TTRPG feels preachy"

* Players feel lectured, not educated
* Horror doesn't land (feels like judgment)
* Not parameter: Information pacing is fine
* Not mechanic: Exploitation tracking works mechanically
* Not architecture: Narrative arc structure appropriate

Analysis:

* Core concept: Teach colonialism through play
* Aesthetic: Horror (complicity)
* Issue: Mechanics judge players rather than letting them discover

This is potentially Level 4, but might be Level 2:

* Is the aesthetic wrong? (Horror inappropriate for education?)
* Or is the mechanic implementation wrong? (Too explicit about judgment?)

Try Level 2 fix first:

* Make Exploitation tracking invisible until reveal
* Frame colonial choices as "reasonable decisions" in-game
* Let horror emerge from realization, not from system judgment

If Level 2 doesn't work → Level 4 pivot:

* Option 1: Target different audience (adults who want serious confrontation)
* Option 2: Change aesthetic (Discovery of history, not Horror of complicity)
* Option 3: Accept concept doesn't work as game (maybe essay instead)

### When to Persist vs. When to Pivot

**Persist (iterate at current level):**

* Core aesthetic moments land sometimes
* Execution needs refinement, not reconception
* Problems are identifiable and fixable
* Playtesters say "almost there"

**Pivot (escalate to higher level):**

* Core aesthetic moments never land
* Same problems persist after multiple fixes
* Playtesters say "I don't get it" or "this isn't for me"
* You're not excited about the vision anymore

**Signs you're iterating at wrong level:**

* Been tuning parameters for weeks (probably Level 2 problem)
* Changed mechanics three times (probably Level 3 problem)
* Restructured twice (probably Level 4 problem)

### Iteration Best Practices

**Document everything:**

* What you changed
* Why you changed it
* Result of change
* Next steps

**Change one thing at a time:**

* Multiple simultaneous changes = can't identify cause
* Exception: Obviously related changes (damage + HP together)

**Test after every significant change:**

* Don't accumulate untested changes
* Paper playtest at minimum
* Real playtest when feasible

**Return to validation after fixes:**

* Coherence audit (did fix break something else?)
* Dynamics prediction (new dynamics emerged?)
* Paper playtest (does it feel better?)

**Know when to stop iterating:**

* Diminishing returns (tiny improvements)
* Chasing perfection (good enough is shipping)
* Optimization paralysis (ship and learn)

### Three Possible Outcomes

**Outcome 1: Ready for Implementation**

* Validation passed
* No major issues identified
* Aesthetics achievable with this design
* → Proceed to prototyping and real playtesting

**Outcome 2: Needs Iteration**

* Add content, tune parameters
* Real playtest throughout

**For Board Games:**

* Create prototype components (paper, printed cards)
* Playtest with target audience
* Iterate parameters based on data
* Refine components and rules
* Blind playtest (others run it without you)

**For TTRPGs:**

* Prepare GM materials (scenarios, notes, handouts)
* Run test session with trusted group
* Refine based on actual play
* Document clear GM guidance
* Run with new group (validate portability)

### The Validation-Implementation Loop

Validation doesn't end at Phase 5:

```
Phase 5 Validation (Paper)
    ↓
Implementation (Build)
    ↓
Real Playtesting (Players)
    ↓
Problems Identified
    ↓
Iteration Protocol (Fix at Correct Level)
    ↓
Re-Validation
    ↓
Re-Implementation
    ↓
[Repeat until shipped]
```

Phase 5 prepares you for effective real playtesting by:

* Catching problems early (cheap to fix)
* Knowing what to test for (predicted dynamics)
