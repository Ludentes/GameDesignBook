# The Design Framework: From Vision to System

## Part 1: Introduction - From Vision to System

You have an idea. Maybe it's a feeling you want players to experience, a theme you want to explore, a mechanic that excites you, or a constraint you must work within. Whatever your starting point, you need a path from that initial spark to a complete, playable game system.

This chapter provides that path.

### What This Framework Does

This framework guides you from any starting point to a complete game system specification. By the end, you'll know:

* **Which mechanics** to include (and which to cut)
* **How many resources** your game needs (and what they do)
* **How much content** is enough (and how to create it)
* **What parameters** to set (HP values, move counts, session lengths)
* **Whether your design works** (and how to fix it if it doesn't)

The framework works across mediums (video games, board games, TTRPGs), across genres (roguelikes, puzzles, narrative games), and across scales (small indie projects to large productions).

### What This Framework Doesn't Do

This framework doesn't:

* Make creative decisions for you (you decide what experience you want to create)
* Guarantee your game will be fun (execution still matters)
* Replace playtesting (it prepares you for effective testing)
* Eliminate iteration (it helps you iterate productively)

Think of it as a structured conversation with an experienced designer who asks the right questions in the right order.

### How to Use This Chapter

**First Time Through:**

1. Read this introduction and the terminology section
2. Skim all phases to understand the complete flow
3. Return to Phase 0 and work through step-by-step
4. Reference other book chapters when directed
5. Complete each phase before moving to the next

**Subsequent Uses:**

* Start at Phase 0 with your new concept
* Use the Quick Reference (Part 9) as a checklist
* Jump directly to specific phases as needed
* Reference Appendices for common patterns

**When Stuck:**

* Check the relevant chapter reference (listed at each phase)
* Review worked examples in the second half of the book
* Consult the decision matrices in Appendix B
* Consider if you're at the wrong phase (maybe need to back up)

### Multiple Entry Points

Real designers don't always start with "I want to create this aesthetic experience." Sometimes you start with:

* A constraint: "Mobile game, 6 months, solo developer"
* A theme: "Colonial horror in space"
* A mechanic: "This card system is interesting"
* An aesthetic: "I want players to feel clever"

The framework accommodates all these starting points. Phase 0 shows you how to begin from wherever you are.

### The Framework as Pathway, Not Prescription

This framework is:

* **Sequential** - Each phase builds on previous phases
* **Flexible** - Multiple valid paths through each phase
* **Iterative** - You'll revisit phases as you learn
* **Practical** - Focused on actionable decisions

This framework is not:

* **Rigid** - You can adapt it to your needs
* **Exhaustive** - It doesn't cover every edge case
* **Prescriptive** - It offers choices, not mandates
* **One-size-fits-all** - Different games need different approaches

Use it as a guide, not a straitjacket. Experienced designers will find places to shortcut or elaborate. Novice designers will find structure and clarity.

### Expected Output

By completing this framework, you'll have:

**From Phase 1 (Aesthetic Crystallization):**

* Defined primary and secondary aesthetics
* Selected target player profile
* Set measurable success criteria

**From Phase 2 (Scaffold Architecture):**

* Chosen structural pattern (loops, narrative arc, puzzle, etc.)
* Specified temporal structure (session lengths, pacing)
* Allocated cognitive load budget

**From Phase 3 (Mechanical Specification):**

* Selected specific mechanics
* Designed resource systems (3-5 resources typical)
* Set initial parameters (numeric values, ranges)

**From Phase 4 (Content Specification):**

* Calculated content requirements
* Decided procedural vs. authored approach
* Integrated theme/setting (or justified abstract approach)

**From Phase 5 (Validation):**

* Completed coherence audit
* Predicted likely dynamics
* Identified iteration needs or implementation readiness

You'll have a complete specification ready for prototyping and playtesting.

### Why Aesthetic-First Design Works

This framework prioritizes aesthetics (the experiences you want to create) over mechanics (the rules that create them) for a critical reason: **mechanics are tools to create experiences**.

If you start with mechanics and hope they create good experiences, you're designing backwards. If you start with desired experiences and choose mechanics to create them, you're designing with purpose.

This doesn't mean mechanics aren't important—they're essential. But they serve your aesthetic goals. Every mechanic, resource, and parameter should justify itself by asking: "Does this serve my aesthetic goals?" If not, cut it.

### A Note on Terminology

This book uses specific terms to avoid confusion. Before diving into the framework, make sure you understand these distinctions (covered in Part 2). Common sources of confusion:

* "Genre" can mean three different things (setting, archetype, or aesthetic)
* "Game" can mean the system or an instance of play
* "Balance" means different things in different contexts

Read Part 2 for clarity on the terminology used throughout this framework.

### On Failure and Iteration

No one gets their design right the first time. This framework will help you fail faster and more productively by:

* Catching problems early (before implementation)
* Identifying what level to fix (parameters vs. mechanics vs. architecture)
* Providing clear validation criteria
* Showing you where to iterate

Expect to cycle through phases multiple times. This is normal. Each iteration makes your design stronger.

### A Word on LLMs and Game Design

Throughout this framework, you'll see occasional notes marked \[LLM-Assistable]. These indicate decisions where Large Language Models can potentially help—not by making the decision for you, but by:

* Generating options to choose from
* Calculating content requirements
* Suggesting parameter ranges
* Identifying edge cases

The second half of this book explores LLM integration in depth. For now, focus on understanding the framework itself.

## Part 2: Terminology Foundations - What We're Building

Before diving into the framework, we need clarity on four terms that are often conflated but mean different things in this book.

### The Four Contexts

#### Medium

**What it is:** The delivery mechanism for your game.

**Examples:**

* Video game (PC, console, mobile)
* Board game (cards, tiles, dice)
* Tabletop RPG (with human GM)
* Mixed reality (AR/VR)

**Why it matters:** Medium constrains available mechanics and defines implementation requirements. You can't do real-time action in a board game. You can't rely on a flexible GM in a video game. Mobile demands different interface design than PC.

**When you choose it:** Usually fixed at the start (often a constraint you're working within).

#### Setting

**What it is:** The thematic dressing—the fictional world, tone, and aesthetic style.

**Examples:**

* Fantasy (medieval, magic, dragons)
* Sci-fi (space, technology, aliens)
* Horror (gothic, psychological, cosmic)
* Historical (specific era and culture)
* Abstract (no theme, pure mechanics)

**Why it matters:** Setting informs content creation through the Build/Suggest/Omit framework (Context chapter). It affects what players expect and how they interpret mechanics.

**When you choose it:** Can be chosen early (theme-first design) or late (after mechanics are solid). Some games work best with abstract settings.

#### Archetype

**What it is:** A validated structural pattern—a pre-packaged scaffold that's been proven to work.

**Examples:**

* Roguelike (permadeath, procedural, meta-progression)
* Daily Puzzle (one challenge per day, compressed loops)
* 4X Strategy (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate)
* MOBA (team-based, lane-focused, hero abilities)
* One-Shot TTRPG (single session, narrative arc)
* Metroidvania (gated exploration, ability unlocks)

**Why it matters:** Archetypes provide starting templates with known patterns for loops, resources, content needs, and common pitfalls. Using an archetype accelerates design by leveraging accumulated knowledge.

**When you choose it:** Optional. You can start from an archetype (modify an existing pattern) or build custom (use framework without template).

#### Aesthetic Profile

**What it is:** The complete specification of the experience you're creating—primary aesthetics, target players, and cognitive load expectations.

**Components:**

* **Primary aesthetics** (Challenge, Discovery, Mastery, Horror, etc.)
* **Player profile** (Casual/Midcore/Hardcore, cognitive capacity)
* **Context** (session length, interruption tolerance, social structure)

**Examples:**

* "Challenge + Completion for casual players in 20-minute sessions"
* "Horror + Discovery for adults in 3-hour one-shot"
* "Mastery + Competition for hardcore players in 60-minute matches"

**Why it matters:** This is what drives every subsequent decision. Your aesthetic profile determines which architectures work, which mechanics to choose, how much content you need, and how to validate success.

**When you choose it:** Always defined in Phase 1 (even if you started elsewhere, you crystallize it here).

### How These Four Relate

Think of them as different dimensions of your game:

```
Medium × Setting × Archetype × Aesthetic Profile = Your Game System

"Mobile × Fantasy × Daily Puzzle × Challenge+Completion(Casual)" 
= Puzzle Quest-style match-3 RPG

"TTRPG × Sci-fi Horror × One-Shot × Horror+Discovery(Adult)" 
= Alien colonial horror game

"Video × Abstract × Roguelike × Challenge+Mastery(Hardcore)" 
= Slay the Spire-style deck-builder
```

**Not all are required:**

* Medium: Always required (you have to deliver the game somehow)
* Setting: Optional (can be abstract)
* Archetype: Optional (can build custom)
* Aesthetic Profile: Always required (this is your purpose)

### Common Confusions to Avoid

**"Genre" is ambiguous** - People use "genre" to mean setting (fantasy), archetype (roguelike), or aesthetic profile (horror game). This book uses the specific terms above to avoid confusion.

**Archetype ≠ Setting** - "Roguelike" is an archetype (structure). "Fantasy" is a setting (theme). You can make a fantasy roguelike OR a sci-fi roguelike. They're independent dimensions.

**Medium ≠ Platform** - Medium is broader than platform. "Video game" is the medium; "PC/console/mobile" are platforms within that medium. Different platforms within the same medium have different constraints.

**Aesthetic ≠ Setting** - Horror is an aesthetic (experience type). Gothic horror vs. cosmic horror are settings (thematic styles). You can create horror aesthetics in many settings—or fail to create horror even in a horror setting.

### Why This Terminology Matters

Precise language enables precise thinking. When you can clearly state:

"I'm making a **mobile** (medium) **fantasy** (setting) **daily puzzle** (archetype) game that creates **Challenge + Completion for casual players** (aesthetic profile)"

...you've already answered dozens of design questions and can move forward with clarity.

Conversely, "I'm making a casual fantasy game" is too vague to provide design direction.

### Using This Terminology in the Framework

As you move through the phases:

* **Phase 0** identifies which of these you're starting with
* **Phase 1** crystallizes your Aesthetic Profile (required)
* **Phase 2** chooses your structural pattern (uses Archetype if available)
* **Phase 4** integrates your Setting (if chosen)
* **Medium** constrains choices throughout all phases

Now that terminology is clear, let's begin the framework.

***

## Part 3: Phase 0 - Starting Point

### Where Are You Beginning?

Real game design doesn't always start with "I want to create this specific aesthetic experience." You might start with:

* A feeling: "I want players to feel clever"
* A constraint: "Mobile game, casual audience, 6-month timeline"
* A theme: "Space horror about colonialism"
* A mechanic: "I prototyped this interesting card system"
* A business need: "We need a free-to-play game with social features"

All of these are valid starting points. This phase shows you how to get from wherever you are to a clear aesthetic profile that can drive the rest of the framework.

### The Four Entry Paths

#### Path A: Aesthetic-First

**"I want players to feel X"**

**Starting point:** You know the experience you want to create.

**Examples:**

* "I want players to feel clever when they solve puzzles"
* "I want players to feel dread as they make morally complex choices"
* "I want players to feel the satisfaction of mastering a difficult skill"
* "I want players to feel connected to friends through shared challenges"

**Strengths of this path:**

* Clearest design direction
* Easiest to validate (did you achieve the feeling?)
* Most likely to result in cohesive design
* Recommended for first-time framework users

**Next steps:**

1. Identify which aesthetic(s) map to your desired feeling (use Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes)
2. Consider who can experience this aesthetic (player profile)
3. Note any known constraints (medium, time, budget)
4. Proceed to Phase 1 to formalize aesthetic profile

**Example progression:**

```
"I want players to feel clever" 
→ Challenge aesthetic (skill-based problem solving)
→ Probably casual to midcore players (hardcore want deeper challenge)
→ Probably mobile or browser (accessible, short sessions)
→ Proceed to Phase 1 with: Challenge + Completion, Casual players, Mobile
```

#### Path B: Constraint-First

**"I have specific limitations I must work within"**

**Starting point:** You know your constraints but not yet what experience fits within them.

**Common constraints:**

* **Medium:** Must be mobile / Must be tabletop / Must be browser-based
* **Time:** 3-month development / Single 4-hour session / 20-minute daily sessions
* **Audience:** Kids 8-12 / Busy adults / Hardcore strategy fans
* **Resources:** Solo developer / No budget for art / Must use existing IP
* **Technical:** No internet required / Must work on low-end phones / Async multiplayer only

**Strengths of this path:**

* Realistic (most commercial projects start here)
* Prevents over-scoping (constraints force focus)
* Leads to practical designs

**Challenges:**

* Need to derive appropriate aesthetics from constraints
* Risk of designing to limitations rather than aspirations

**Next steps:**

1. List all fixed constraints
2. Determine what's possible within those constraints
3. Choose aesthetics that fit constraints (use decision matrices)
4. Proceed to Phase 1 to formalize aesthetic profile

**Example progression:**

```
"Mobile game, casual audience, 6 months, solo dev" 
→ Mobile = short sessions, simple controls, interruption-tolerant
→ Casual = low cognitive load, clear goals, immediate satisfaction
→ 6 months solo = limited content, must scope carefully
→ Suggests: Compressed loops, daily puzzle archetype, Challenge+Completion
→ Proceed to Phase 1 with: Challenge + Completion, Casual players, Mobile
```

**Decision matrix for constraints → aesthetics:**

| Constraint                     | Suggested Aesthetics                | Avoid Aesthetics                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Very short sessions (\<10 min) | Challenge, Completion               | Narrative, Immersion                  |
| Long sessions (2+ hours)       | Mastery, Discovery, Narrative       | Completion (unless episodic)          |
| Casual audience                | Challenge (moderate), Completion    | Mastery (deep), Competition           |
| Hardcore audience              | Mastery, Challenge, Competition     | Completion (trivial goals)            |
| Interruption-prone             | Completion, Discovery               | Challenge (timing), Fellowship (sync) |
| Limited content budget         | Mastery, Challenge                  | Discovery, Narrative                  |
| Social platform                | Fellowship, Expression, Competition | Horror, Immersion (broken by chat)    |

#### Path C: Theme-First

**"I want to explore this setting/topic/story"**

**Starting point:** You know what world, theme, or topic you want to explore.

**Examples:**

* "I want to make a game about colonial horror in space"
* "I want players to experience being inside a Miyazaki film"
* "I want to explore the ethics of AI consciousness"
* "I want a game set in 1920s archaeological digs"

**Strengths of this path:**

* Strong creative vision
* Clear content direction
* Marketing/pitch clarity

**Challenges:**

* Must find mechanics that serve theme (avoid "space coffee")
* Theme can constrain mechanics inappropriately
* Risk of prioritizing flavor over function

**Next steps:**

1. Identify what about this theme excites you (the core appeal)
2. Determine what aesthetics match that appeal
3. Ensure mechanics will reinforce (not fight) theme
4. Proceed to Phase 1 with compatible aesthetics

**Example progression:**

```
"Colonial horror in space" 
→ What's exciting? Moral complicity, dread, historical parallels
→ Maps to: Horror (complicity type), Discovery (uncover truth)
→ Audience: Adults who engage with serious themes
→ Medium: Probably TTRPG (allows moral complexity, GM flexibility)
→ Proceed to Phase 1 with: Horror + Discovery, Adult players, TTRPG
```

**Theme → Aesthetic mapping guide:**

**If your theme is about...**

* **Exploration/Discovery:** Discovery aesthetic (obviously)
* **Moral choices:** Horror (complicity) or Narrative (consequences)
* **Mastering a skill:** Mastery aesthetic (sword fighting, magic, etc.)
* **Overcoming obstacles:** Challenge aesthetic
* **Building/creating:** Expression aesthetic
* **Competition/conflict:** Competition aesthetic
* **Relationships/community:** Fellowship aesthetic
* **Becoming powerful:** Power progression (Mastery subset)

**Warning signs of theme-first problems:**

* "It's set in space because space is cool" (no aesthetic reason)
* "The theme requires these 15 mechanics" (theme dictating bloat)
* "Players must read this 10-page lore doc" (theme overwhelming play)
* "It's horror-themed but upbeat" (theme contradicting aesthetic)

#### Path D: Mechanic-First

**"I have this interesting mechanic/system"**

**Starting point:** You've prototyped or conceived a mechanic that excites you.

**Examples:**

* "I made a card system where cards transform based on adjacency"
* "I have a dice mechanic where you roll for consequences, not success"
* "I prototyped a movement system that feels really smooth"
* "I designed a resource conversion system with interesting decisions"

**Strengths of this path:**

* Already have working prototype
* Mechanic is validated as interesting
* Can build around known constraints

**Challenges:**

* Must identify what aesthetics the mechanic actually serves
* Risk of building a game around a mechanic that doesn't support broader experience
* May need to cut favorite mechanics if they don't serve aesthetic

**Next steps:**

1. Play with the mechanic extensively
2. Identify what feels good about it (the aesthetic it creates)
3. Determine what player profile enjoys this aesthetic
4. Decide if this mechanic is the core or just a component
5. Proceed to Phase 1 with aesthetics the mechanic serves

**Example progression:**

```
"Card system where cards transform based on adjacency" 
→ What feels good? Planning combos, seeing transformations unfold
→ Maps to: Challenge (planning), Discovery (finding combos), Mastery (optimization)
→ Who enjoys this? Midcore to hardcore (requires thinking ahead)
→ Could be digital or physical
→ Proceed to Phase 1 with: Challenge + Mastery, Midcore players, Medium TBD
```

**Critical questions for mechanic-first:**

* **What does this mechanic make you feel?** (Identify aesthetic)
* **Who would enjoy this feeling?** (Identify player profile)
* **How long does the interesting decision take?** (Informs loop structure)
* **Does this need to be the core, or could it be a subsystem?** (Scope)
* **What other mechanics does this require?** (Dependencies)
* **What would make this mechanic fail?** (Risks)

**Warning signs of mechanic-first problems:**

* "I have 8 cool mechanics" (probably too many)
* "This mechanic is complex but important" (cognitive load issue)
* "Players will understand it after a few hours" (onboarding problem)
* "It's technically interesting" (but does it feel good?)

### Convergence Point: What You Need Before Phase 1

Regardless of which path you started on, before proceeding to Phase 1 you must have:

**Required:**

* [ ] **Aesthetic direction** (even if tentative): What experience(s) are you creating?
* [ ] **Player profile** (even if broad): Who is this for?
* [ ] **Known constraints** (documented): What must you work within?

**Optional but helpful:**

* [ ] **Medium** chosen (or options narrowed)
* [ ] **Setting** preference (or decision to go abstract)
* [ ] **Archetype** consideration (starting template or building custom)

**Example complete starting specification:**

From Aesthetic-First:

```
Primary Aesthetic: Challenge + Completion
Player Profile: Casual players (20-30 min sessions, low cognitive load)
Constraints: Mobile platform, solo developer, 6-month timeline
Medium: Mobile video game
Setting: TBD (probably abstract)
Archetype: Considering daily puzzle archetype
```

From Constraint-First:

```
Primary Aesthetic: Horror + Discovery (derived from constraints)
Player Profile: Adults, single 3-4 hour session
Constraints: TTRPG medium, one-shot format, teaching tool
Medium: Tabletop RPG
Setting: Sci-fi colonial horror
Archetype: One-shot narrative arc
```

From Theme-First:

```
Primary Aesthetic: Discovery + Wonder (from theme appeal)
Player Profile: Midcore players, exploration-focused
Constraints: PC/console, narrative-heavy, indie budget
Medium: Video game (PC primary)
Setting: Miyazaki-inspired fantasy
Archetype: Exploration-based (Metroidvania-adjacent)
```

From Mechanic-First:

```
Primary Aesthetic: Challenge + Mastery (what mechanic creates)
Player Profile: Midcore to hardcore
Constraints: Digital or physical, mechanic is card-based
Medium: TBD (could be video or board game)
Setting: TBD (abstract or light theme)
Archetype: Custom (no exact match for this mechanic)
```

### Common Starting Point Problems

**Problem: "I want to make a fun game"**

* Too vague. "Fun" isn't an aesthetic—it's the result of achieving your aesthetic goals.
* Solution: Identify specific feeling ("fun" how? Clever? Excited? Satisfied? Connected?)

**Problem: "I want to make a game like X but with Y"**

* Derivative starting point, but workable.
* Solution: Identify what aesthetic X provides, how Y changes it, proceed from there.

**Problem: "I have 12 constraints and 8 mechanics I want to include"**

* Over-constrained and over-scoped.
* Solution: Prioritize. What's actually required? What's actually core?

**Problem: "I'm not sure what aesthetics my mechanic creates"**

* Need more experimentation.
* Solution: Prototype and play. What feels good? When? Why?

**Problem: "My theme requires mechanics that fight each other"**

* Theme is over-determining design.
* Solution: Simplify theme or abstract it. Theme serves aesthetic, not vice versa.

### Moving Forward

Once you have your starting specification (aesthetic direction + player profile + constraints), you're ready for Phase 1: Aesthetic Crystallization.

Phase 1 will take your tentative aesthetic direction and formalize it into a complete aesthetic profile with measurable success criteria. This profile will drive every subsequent decision in the framework.

**If your starting specification feels incomplete or uncertain, that's okay.** Phase 1 will help you clarify. The important thing is having a direction to start from.

**If you have multiple possible directions, choose one.** You can always run through the framework multiple times to compare options. Trying to design two games simultaneously leads to confusion.

**If you're genuinely stuck between paths, default to Aesthetic-First.** Start with "I want players to feel X" and work from there. This is the clearest path through the framework.

***

**You're now ready to proceed to Phase 1: Aesthetic Crystallization.**

Phase 1 will help you:

* Precisely define your primary and secondary aesthetics
* Select your target player profile
* Set measurable success criteria
* Validate that your aesthetic goals are achievable

Turn to Phase 1 when ready to continue.
