# Synthesis Chapter: The Design Framework

## Proposed Structure

### Part 1: Introduction (2-3 pages)

**"From Vision to System"**

* What this chapter does: Takes you from aesthetic goal to complete game system
* How to use it: Follow phases sequentially, reference other chapters as needed
* Multiple entry points: Aesthetic-first, constraint-first, theme-first, mechanic-first
* The framework is a conversation, not a checklist
* Expected output: Specific mechanics, parameters, content requirements, validation criteria

***

### Part 2: Terminology Foundations (1-2 pages)

**"What We're Building"**

**The Four Contexts:**

* **Medium:** TTRPG, video game, board game, etc. (delivery mechanism)
* **Setting:** Fantasy, sci-fi, horror, abstract, etc. (thematic dressing)
* **Archetype:** Roguelike, daily puzzle, 4X, one-shot, etc. (structural pattern)
* **Aesthetic Profile:** Primary aesthetics + player type + cognitive load (experience goal)

**Why These Matter:**

* Medium constrains mechanics and content
* Setting informs Build/Suggest/Omit
* Archetype provides starting template (optional)
* Aesthetic Profile drives all decisions

***

### Part 3: Phase 0 - Starting Point (3-4 pages)

**"Where Are You Beginning?"**

**Flexible Entry Paths:**

**Path A: Aesthetic-First**

* "I want players to feel X"
* Define aesthetic profile first
* Derive constraints and structure from aesthetics
* Example prompt: "I want players to feel clever and accomplished in 20-minute sessions"

**Path B: Constraint-First**

* "I have 6 months, mobile platform, solo dev"
* Define constraints first
* Derive appropriate aesthetics and structure
* Example prompt: "Mobile game, casual audience, no budget for content"

**Path C: Theme-First**

* "I want to make a space horror game"
* Define setting first
* Derive compatible aesthetics and mechanics
* Example prompt: "Colonial horror in space, teaching through play"

**Path D: Mechanic-First**

* "I have this cool card system"
* Define mechanics first
* Derive what aesthetics they serve
* Example prompt: "Deck-building with resource conversion"

**Convergence Point:** All paths must produce:

* Clear aesthetic profile (primary aesthetics defined)
* Known constraints (medium, time, audience, resources)
* Optional: Setting or archetype preference

**Output:** Complete starting specification

***

### Part 4: Phase 1 - Aesthetic Crystallization (4-5 pages)

**"What Experience Are You Creating?"**

**Step 1.1: Define Primary Aesthetics**

* Use Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes (reference Part 3: Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes)
* Identify primary (main experience goal)
* Identify secondary (supporting experiences)
* Identify exclusions (what this is NOT)
* Validate compatibility (do these aesthetics work together?)

**Step 1.2: Select Player Profile**

* Reference Players & Contexts section
* Choose cognitive investment level:
  * **Casual:** 5-30 min sessions, 3±2 trackable elements
  * **Midcore:** 30-90 min sessions, 5-7 systems
  * **Hardcore:** 2+ hour sessions, high complexity tolerance
  * **Special cases:** Busy adults, accessibility needs
* Consider platform context (mobile, PC, console, tabletop)
* Consider social context (solo, multiplayer, sync/async)

**Step 1.3: Set Success Criteria**

* What does perfect success feel like?
* What measurable outcomes indicate success? (reference Measurables Catalog)
* What is minimum viable aesthetic? (what MUST work?)
* How will you know if you've failed?

**Decision Point:** Can you clearly state: "This game creates \[aesthetic] for \[player type] in \[context]"?

**Output:** Complete aesthetic profile with validation criteria

***

### Part 5: Phase 2 - Scaffold Architecture (6-8 pages)

**"What Structure Supports Your Aesthetics?"**

**Step 2.1: Choose Structural Pattern**

**Pattern A: Loop-Based Architecture**

* Best for: Action games, roguelikes, strategy games, most video games
* Reference: Temporal Architecture: Loops chapter
* Architectures:
  * **Full Stack** (micro + meso + macro): Long-term progression
  * **Compressed** (micro + meso): Session-complete games
  * **Inverted** (macro-heavy): Incremental/idle games
  * **Constrained** (single scale): Pure gameplay focus

**Pattern B: Narrative Arc Architecture**

* Best for: Story games, TTRPGs, walking simulators, one-shots
* Structure: Acts with decision points/story beats
* Pacing: Tension/release rhythm
* No repeating loops, but clear progression

**Pattern C: Puzzle Architecture**

* Best for: Pure puzzle games, brain teasers
* Structure: Discrete challenges with solutions
* Minimal or no meta-progression
* Focus on problem-solving moment

**Pattern D: Exploration Architecture**

* Best for: Walking simulators, metroidvanias, open-world discovery
* Structure: Space-based progression, gating, revelation
* Discovery-driven, player-paced

**Pattern E: Progression Architecture**

* Best for: RPGs, character builders, incremental games
* Structure: Numerical advancement, power curves
* Long-term growth focus

**Decision Matrix: Aesthetic + Player Profile → Architecture**

| Aesthetic Primary | Casual Players             | Midcore Players        | Hardcore Players       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Challenge         | Compressed Loops           | Full Stack Loops       | Full Stack Loops       |
| Discovery         | Compressed/Exploration     | Full Stack/Exploration | Full Stack/Exploration |
| Mastery           | Compressed/Puzzle          | Full Stack/Loops       | Full Stack/Complex     |
| Narrative         | Narrative Arc              | Narrative Arc/Loops    | Narrative Arc/Loops    |
| Horror            | Narrative Arc              | Narrative Arc          | Narrative Arc          |
| Fellowship        | Varies by social structure |                        |                        |

**Step 2.2: Design Temporal Structure**

**For Loop-Based:**

* Define micro loop (1-5 min): What's the moment-to-moment action?
* Define meso loop (10-60 min): What's the medium-term goal?
* Define macro loop (hours to weeks): What's the long-term progression?
* Specify loop lengths based on player profile
* Ensure each loop scale serves primary aesthetic

**For Narrative Arc:**

* Define acts (3-5 acts typical)
* Define decision points/story beats per act
* Specify pacing (escalation, climax, resolution)
* Calculate time per act

**For Other Patterns:**

* Define equivalent structural elements
* Specify progression logic
* Determine pacing requirements

**Step 2.3: Allocate Cognitive Load**

* Reference: Cognitive Load chapter
* Total budget from player profile (casual = low, hardcore = high)
* Distribute across:
  * Core mechanic (largest allocation)
  * Goal tracking
  * Resource management
  * Meta-progression/context
  * Social/communication (if multiplayer)
* Ensure primary aesthetic gets priority in allocation
* Validate: Does total stay within budget?

**Decision Point:** Does your chosen architecture support your aesthetics within your player's cognitive capacity?

**Output:** Complete scaffold specification with temporal structure and load allocation

***

### Part 6: Phase 3 - Mechanical Specification (8-10 pages)

**"What Are the Actual Rules?"**

**Step 3.1: Select Core Mechanics**

**Option A: Start from Archetype (if chosen)**

* Reference archetype template (see Appendices)
* Note typical mechanics for this archetype
* Decide what to keep vs. change
* Justify changes based on aesthetic goals

**Option B: Build from Aesthetics (if no archetype)**

* Reference: Chapter 1 (System Components)
* Reference: Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes
* Map aesthetics to mechanical categories:
  * Challenge → skill-based decisions, meaningful failure
  * Discovery → hidden information, exploration, reveals
  * Mastery → skill curves, optimization, improvement
  * Expression → creation tools, customization, sharing
  * Narrative → choices, consequences, story progression
  * Fellowship → communication, cooperation, shared goals
  * Horror → vulnerability, consequences, dread
  * (etc. for other aesthetics)

**Mechanic Selection Process:**

1. Identify required mechanical functions (from Chapter 1)
2. Choose specific mechanics that serve aesthetics
3. Ensure each mechanic justifies its cognitive cost
4. Remove mechanics that don't serve primary aesthetic

**Step 3.2: Design Resource Systems**

* Reference: Resource Management chapters
* Identify resource types needed:
  * **Limiters:** Create scarcity and tension (HP, mana, moves, time)
  * **Currencies:** Enable choice and strategy (gold, XP, materials)
  * **Trackers:** Show progress and state (quest completion, map explored)
  * **Meta-resources:** Cross-session persistence (unlocks, skill points)

**Resource Design Questions:**

* How many resources? (Apply 3-5 resource guideline)
* Scarcity or abundance for each?
* Recovery mechanisms? (regeneration, rewards, persistence)
* Cross-resource interactions? (spend X to gain Y)
* Which resources serve which aesthetics?

**Step 3.3: Set Initial Parameters**

* Reference: From Principles to Numbers (Measurables catalog)
* Map aesthetic goals to numeric targets:
  * Challenge → target win rate, difficulty curve
  * Discovery → content variety, hidden percentage
  * Mastery → skill ceiling, improvement rate
  * Completion → session length, goal clarity
* Set parameter ranges for tuning (min/max values)
* Define success/failure conditions
* Establish progression curves (if applicable)

**For Video Games:**

* Specific numeric values (HP, damage, costs)
* Difficulty scaling formulas
* Randomness ranges

**For TTRPGs:**

* Roll mechanics (dice pools, target numbers)
* Resource pools (abstract quantities)
* GM guidance ranges

**For Board Games:**

* Component counts
* Action economies
* Scoring systems

**Decision Point:** Can you play this on paper/in your head? If not, what's still undefined?

**Output:** Complete mechanical specification with resources and initial parameters

***

### Part 7: Phase 4 - Content Specification (6-8 pages)

**"How Much Content Do You Need?"**

**Step 4.1: Calculate Content Needs**

**Content Formula Framework:**

**Base Formula:**

```
Required Content = (Session Length × Expected Sessions) / Content Consumption Rate
```

**But consumption rate varies by aesthetic:**

**Discovery-Heavy Games:**

* Consume content fastest (novelty required)
* Formula: High variety needed
* Heuristic: "Discovery games need 3x more unique content than Mastery games"
* Example calculation:

  ```
  If target is 20 hours of Discovery gameplay:- Each hour needs 10 unique discoveries- Total needed: 200 unique elements- With procedural variation: 50 templates × 4 variations = 200
  ```

**Mastery-Heavy Games:**

* Re-use content (improvement is the content)
* Formula: Moderate variety, high replayability
* Heuristic: "Mastery games need depth over breadth"
* Example calculation:

  ```
  If target is 20 hours of Mastery gameplay:- Need 5-10 distinct challenges- Each replayed 20-40 times with increasing difficulty- Total needed: 10 core scenarios with difficulty scaling
  ```

**Challenge-Heavy Games:**

* Balance required (neither pure novelty nor pure repetition)
* Formula: Moderate variety with tuning
* Heuristic: "Challenge games need enough variety to prevent pattern memorization"
* Example calculation:

  ```
  If target is 20 hours of Challenge gameplay:- Each challenge encountered 2-5 times- Need 40-100 distinct challenges- Organized into difficulty tiers
  ```

**Narrative-Heavy Games:**

* Linear consumption (story beats)
* Formula: Story length × branching factor
* Heuristic: "Linear stories need X hours of content for X hours of play; branching stories need more"
* Example calculation:

  ```
  If target is 10 hours of Narrative gameplay:- Linear: 10 hours of story content- Branching (3 paths): 15-20 hours of story content- Heavy branching (meaningful choices): 25-30 hours of story content
  ```

**Content Calculation by Architecture:**

**Loop-Based Games:**

* Micro loop: Content per attempt (e.g., 10 enemy types)
* Meso loop: Content per session (e.g., 5 level themes)
* Macro loop: Content for progression (e.g., 50 unlockables)

**Narrative Arc Games:**

* Decision points × branches = scenario count
* Example: 12 decision points × 2 branches average = 24 scenarios

**Puzzle Games:**

* Puzzles needed = (Days active × Puzzles per day)
* Example: 90 days × 1 puzzle = 90 unique puzzles

**Worked Example (included in chapter):** "Daily Puzzle Game Content Calculation"

* Target: 90 days of daily puzzles
* Discovery (light) + Challenge aesthetic
* Formula: 90 days × 1 puzzle = 90 puzzles minimum
* But: With procedural generation: 20 templates × 5 variations = 100 puzzles
* Implementation: 20 hand-crafted patterns, procedural difficulty scaling

**Step 4.2: Procedural vs. Authored Decision**

**Decision Matrix:**

**Go Procedural When:**

* High content volume needed (100+ elements)
* Content is systemic (follows rules)
* Budget/time limited
* Aesthetic tolerates variation (Discovery, Challenge)

**Go Authored When:**

* Narrative-heavy (story requires coherence)
* Quality critical (each piece must be perfect)
* Lower volume needed (\<100 elements)
* Aesthetic requires precision (Narrative, Horror)

**Hybrid Approach (Most Common):**

* Authored templates
* Procedural variation
* Hand-tuned edge cases

**Step 4.3: Information Architecture**

**Tutorial Design:**

* What must players know immediately?
* What can be discovered?
* What should never be explained?
* Tutorial length from cognitive load budget

**Onboarding Sequence:**

* First session goals
* First week goals
* Complexity ramping schedule

**Feedback Systems:**

* Immediate feedback (action results)
* Short-term feedback (micro loop completion)
* Long-term feedback (macro progression)

**Step 4.4: Context Integration (Build/Suggest/Omit)**

* Reference: Context chapter (Build/Suggest/Omit framework)

**If Setting Already Chosen:**

* Apply Build/Suggest/Omit to ensure coherence
* Build: Essential thematic elements
* Suggest: Supporting atmospheric elements
* Omit: Contradictory or distracting elements
* Iterate until mechanics and setting mutually reinforce

**If Setting Not Chosen:**

* Option 1: Select setting that fits mechanics
* Option 2: Go abstract (mechanics-only)
* Option 3: Minimal dressing (just enough context)

**Thematic Coherence Questions:**

* Do mechanics and theme reinforce each other?
* Does setting serve aesthetics or fight them?
* Can players intuit mechanics from theme?
* Does theme add cognitive load or reduce it?

**Decision Point:** Can you list everything that needs to be created? Do you know how much is enough?

**Output:** Content specification (quantity, type, authorship), information architecture, thematic integration

***

### Part 8: Phase 5 - Validation & Iteration (6-8 pages)

**"Does This Actually Work?"**

**Step 5.1: Coherence Audit**

**Aesthetic Coherence:**

* [ ] Every mechanic serves primary aesthetic
* [ ] No mechanics fight against primary aesthetic
* [ ] Secondary aesthetics support, not compete with primary
* [ ] Excluded aesthetics are truly absent

**Structural Coherence:**

* [ ] Loop scales (or narrative beats) connect properly
* [ ] Micro success contributes to meso progress
* [ ] Meso success contributes to macro progress (if exists)
* [ ] Pacing serves aesthetic goals

**Thematic Coherence:**

* [ ] Setting and mechanics reinforce each other
* [ ] No "space coffee" (theme contradicts mechanics)
* [ ] Players can intuit mechanics from theme
* [ ] Theme adds to experience, not just decoration

**Cognitive Load Coherence:**

* [ ] Total load within player profile budget
* [ ] Priority elements get most cognitive space
* [ ] Complexity ramps appropriately
* [ ] No unnecessary complexity

**Step 5.2: Dynamics Prediction**

**Expected Dynamics Checklist:**

For Loop-Based Games:

* [ ] Does micro loop success contribute to meso progress?
* [ ] Does meso loop success contribute to macro progress?
* [ ] Does failure provide value? (information, resources, or progress)
* [ ] Can players see long-term goals from short-term actions?
* [ ] Do resources create interesting tensions?
* [ ] Are there meaningful choices at each scale?

For Narrative Arc Games:

* [ ] Do early decisions have consequences later?
* [ ] Is there escalating tension across acts?
* [ ] Do revelations recontextualize previous events?
* [ ] Can players affect outcomes meaningfully?
* [ ] Does structure support aesthetic pacing?

For All Games:

* [ ] What will players optimize? (Is this desired?)
* [ ] What strategies will emerge? (Are they interesting?)
* [ ] Where will players get stuck? (Is this intentional?)
* [ ] What will players ignore? (Should they?)

**Unintended Dynamics Watch List:**

* Dominant strategies that trivialize challenge
* Exploits that break progression
* Social dynamics that create toxicity (multiplayer)
* Grinding that replaces skill
* Confusion that blocks progress

**Step 5.3: Paper Playtest**

**For Video/Board Games:**

* Walk through complete session on paper
* Track all resources manually
* Simulate decision points
* Note where rules unclear or break

**For TTRPGs:**

* Outline complete session beat-by-beat
* Identify prep needed
* Note improvisation points
* Check pacing realistic

**Playtest Questions:**

* First 5 minutes: Is it clear what to do?
* First hour: Is it engaging?
* Mid-session: Is progress meaningful?
* End of session: Was it satisfying?
* Return decision: Would I play again?

**Step 5.4: Iteration Protocol**

**When Playtest Reveals Problems:**

**Symptom: Numbers feel wrong (too easy/hard, too fast/slow)** → **Fix Level: Parameters** → **Action:** Tune values, adjust curves, retest → **Timeline:** Quick iteration (hours to days)

**Symptom: Mechanics don't create intended feel** → **Fix Level: Mechanics** → **Action:** Change specific mechanics, keep structure → **Timeline:** Moderate iteration (days to weeks)

**Symptom: Loop/arc structure doesn't support aesthetic** → **Fix Level: Architecture** → **Action:** Restructure temporal elements → **Timeline:** Major iteration (weeks to months)

**Symptom: Players can't/won't engage with core concept** → **Fix Level: Aesthetic Match** → **Action:** Change target player profile OR change aesthetic goal → **Timeline:** Fundamental pivot (restart framework)

**Iteration Decision Tree:**

```
Problem identified
    ↓
Is it a numbers problem? (win rates, timing, costs)
    YES → Tune parameters
    NO ↓
Is it a mechanic problem? (rules don't create desired dynamics)
    YES → Change mechanics, keep structure
    NO ↓
Is it a structure problem? (loops/pacing don't work)
    YES → Restructure architecture
    NO ↓
Is it an aesthetic mismatch? (wrong game for these players, or wrong players for this game)
    YES → Pivot aesthetic or audience
```

**When to Persist vs. Pivot:**

* Persist: If core aesthetic moments land, but execution needs work
* Pivot: If core aesthetic moments don't land even when executed well

**Decision Point:** Is this game ready for implementation, or does something fundamental need to change?

**Output:** Validated design with clear iteration plan or pivot decision
