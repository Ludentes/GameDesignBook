# The Design Framework: Phase 1 - Aesthetic Crystallization

## What Experience Are You Creating?

You've arrived at Phase 1 with a direction—whether from aesthetics, constraints, theme, or mechanics. Now it's time to crystallize that direction into a precise aesthetic profile that will drive every subsequent decision.

By the end of this phase, you'll have:

* Clearly defined primary and secondary aesthetics
* A specific target player profile
* Measurable success criteria
* Validation that your goals are achievable together

This is the foundation of your entire design. Get this right, and the rest of the framework flows naturally. Get this wrong, and you'll struggle at every subsequent phase.

### Why Aesthetic Crystallization Matters

Vague aesthetic goals lead to vague designs. "Make a fun game" or "make an engaging experience" provides no design direction. But "Create Challenge aesthetic for casual players through 20-minute puzzle sessions with clear completion goals" gives you:

* A target feeling (Challenge)
* A target audience (casual players)
* A time constraint (20 minutes)
* A structure hint (puzzle sessions)
* A secondary aesthetic (Completion)

Every mechanic, resource, and parameter can now be evaluated against this profile. Does this mechanic serve Challenge? Does this system fit casual cognitive load? Does this loop structure support 20-minute sessions?

**Precision enables progress.**

***

## Step 1.1: Define Primary Aesthetics

### What Are Aesthetics?

In this framework, aesthetics are the specific emotional/psychological experiences you want to create. They're not about visual style or theme—those are Setting concerns. Aesthetics are about what players **feel** during play.

**The core aesthetics** (from MDA framework and expanded):

* **Challenge** - Overcoming obstacles through skill
* **Discovery** - Finding and learning new things
* **Mastery** - Improving skill over time through practice
* **Completion** - Achieving goals and finishing tasks
* **Expression** - Creating and showing personal creativity
* **Fellowship** - Social connection and collaboration
* **Competition** - Testing yourself against others
* **Narrative** - Experiencing a story and making meaningful choices
* **Power** - Becoming stronger and more capable
* **Horror** - Experiencing dread, fear, or complicity
* **Wonder** - Experiencing awe and beauty
* **Collection** - Gathering and organizing items/achievements

### Choosing Your Primary Aesthetic

**Most games have 1-3 primary aesthetics.** More than that usually means lack of focus or conflicting goals.

**Questions to identify your primary aesthetic:**

1. What do you want players to **feel** during play?
2. What would make a session **successful** from their perspective?
3. What would they **tell their friends** about the experience?
4. What makes this experience **distinct** from other games?

**Example aesthetic identification:**

**"I want players to feel clever"**
→ Primary: **Challenge** (skill-based problem solving)
→ Secondary: **Completion** (finishing puzzles provides validation)

**"I want players to feel the dread of complicity"**
→ Primary: **Horror** (moral/psychological dread)
→ Secondary: **Discovery** (uncovering truth)
→ NOT: Challenge (difficulty would distract from horror)

**"I want players to master complex systems"**
→ Primary: **Mastery** (improving over time)
→ Secondary: **Challenge** (difficulty provides growth opportunity)
→ Optional: **Discovery** (learning system depth)

**"I want players to build and share creations"**
→ Primary: **Expression** (personal creativity)
→ Secondary: **Fellowship** (sharing with community)
→ Optional: **Completion** (finishing projects)

### Using Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes

**Reference: Part 3 - Aesthetic Paradigm Recipes**

Some aesthetic combinations are validated—they work well together. Others fight each other.

**Validated combinations:**

* **Challenge + Mastery** (roguelikes, competitive games)
  * Challenge provides immediate goals, Mastery provides long-term goals
  * Players improve at overcoming challenges

* **Discovery + Wonder** (exploration games, walking simulators)
  * Discovery drives exploration, Wonder is the payoff
  * Each discovery creates moments of awe

* **Challenge + Completion** (puzzle games, casual games)
  * Challenge provides engagement, Completion provides satisfaction
  * Each completed challenge feels like progress

* **Mastery + Competition** (esports, fighting games)
  * Mastery drives improvement, Competition validates skill
  * Getting better enables winning

* **Horror + Discovery** (horror games, mystery games)
  * Discovery reveals the horror, Horror motivates caution in discovery
  * Learning the truth is both goal and punishment

* **Expression + Fellowship** (creative/social games, cozy sims)
  * Expression creates content, Fellowship shares it
  * Creating things to show others

* **Narrative + Discovery** (story-driven games, detective games)
  * Narrative provides context, Discovery advances story
  * Uncovering the story through investigation

**Problematic combinations:**

* **Horror + Power** (power fantasy undermines vulnerability)
* **Challenge + Expression** (difficulty interferes with creativity)
* **Mastery + Narrative** (story pacing conflicts with skill practice)
* **Competition + Horror** (competing with others breaks horror immersion)
* **Fellowship + Horror** (socializing breaks dread)

**These aren't absolute rules** - clever designers can make any combination work. But if you choose a problematic combination, you need a clear plan for how they'll coexist rather than compete.

### Primary vs. Secondary vs. Excluded Aesthetics

**Primary aesthetics (1-2):**

* The core experience
* What you optimize for
* What failure here means the game failed
* Gets most cognitive load budget
* Drives mechanical selection

**Secondary aesthetics (1-2):**

* Supporting experiences
* Enhance primary but don't compete
* Can be sacrificed if conflicting with primary
* Get less cognitive load budget
* Provide variety or depth

**Excluded aesthetics:**

* Explicitly not pursuing
* Would contradict primary aesthetics
* Helps you cut mechanics that don't serve goals
* Clarifies what this game is NOT

**Example aesthetic hierarchy:**

**Daily Puzzle Game:**

* Primary: Challenge (solving puzzle), Completion (finishing daily challenge)
* Secondary: Discovery (new puzzle each day)
* Excluded: Mastery (doesn't carry over day to day), Power (no progression), Fellowship (solo experience)

**Souls-like Action RPG:**

* Primary: Challenge (difficult combat), Mastery (improving through practice)
* Secondary: Discovery (exploring world), Power (character builds)
* Excluded: Completion (many players never finish), Narrative (minimal story), Fellowship (mostly solo)

**Cozy Farming Sim:**

* Primary: Expression (designing farm), Completion (daily tasks)
* Secondary: Collection (gathering items), Fellowship (optional social)
* Excluded: Challenge (low difficulty), Competition (no pressure), Horror (positive tone)

### Validating Aesthetic Choices

**Before proceeding, verify:**

**Coherence Check:**

* [ ] Primary aesthetics complement each other (use recipes)
* [ ] Secondary aesthetics support, not compete with primary
* [ ] Excluded aesthetics would actually hurt experience
* [ ] Can clearly state what this game is and is NOT

**Scope Check:**

* [ ] Not trying to be all things to all people (1-3 primaries only)
* [ ] Primary aesthetics are achievable within constraints
* [ ] Clear hierarchy (which aesthetic wins if there's conflict?)

**Audience Check:**

* [ ] Target players actually want these aesthetics (see player profiles)
* [ ] Aesthetic combination has proven audience
* [ ] Not pursuing contradictory player types

**If validation fails:**

* Too many primary aesthetics → Choose what matters most, demote or exclude rest
* Aesthetics conflict → Choose which wins or find third option
* No proven audience → Either you're innovating (risky) or confused (likely)

***

## Step 1.2: Select Player Profile

### Why Player Profile Matters

The same aesthetic experienced by different players creates different design requirements:

**Challenge aesthetic for:**

* **Casual players** → Clear goals, moderate difficulty, 70-80% win rate
* **Midcore players** → Balanced difficulty, 50-60% win rate, skill curves
* **Hardcore players** → Punishing difficulty, \<50% win rate, deep optimization

If you design Challenge for hardcore players but market to casual players, you've failed both audiences.

### The Three Primary Profiles

**Reference: Players and Contexts section**

#### Casual Players

**Profile:**

* **Session length:** 5-30 minutes
* **Cognitive load capacity:** Low (3±2 trackable elements)
* **Context:** Mobile, browser, interruption-prone environments
* **Motivation:** Immediate satisfaction, clear progress, social connection
* **Skill level:** Variable, often rusty, need clear onboarding
* **Time commitment:** Low investment, can't maintain complex mental models between sessions

**Design implications:**

* Simple mechanics (learn in \<5 minutes)
* Clear goals (always know what to do)
* Frequent positive feedback
* Forgiving failure (can retry easily)
* Minimal memory requirements
* Progress in every session
* Aggressive session recaps

**Compatible aesthetics:** Challenge (moderate), Completion, Discovery (light), Fellowship (social casual)

**Incompatible aesthetics:** Mastery (deep), Competition (high stakes), Horror (requires sustained attention)

**Examples:** Wordle, Candy Crush, Among Us, mobile puzzle games

#### Midcore Players

**Profile:**

* **Session length:** 30-90 minutes
* **Cognitive load capacity:** Moderate (5-7 trackable systems)
* **Context:** Dedicated device, some interruptions possible
* **Motivation:** Mastery, progression, competition, variety
* **Skill level:** Competent, willing to learn complex systems
* **Time commitment:** Regular but not hardcore, can maintain state between sessions

**Design implications:**

* Moderate mechanical complexity
* Clear but challenging goals
* Meaningful progression systems
* Skill-based advancement
* Some memory required but manageable
* Session-level and meta-level goals
* Onboarding spread over hours

**Compatible aesthetics:** Most aesthetics work (versatile audience)

**Examples:** Clash Royale, Genshin Impact, Rocket League, most indie games

#### Hardcore Players

**Profile:**

* **Session length:** 2+ hours
* **Cognitive load capacity:** High (complex systems welcome)
* **Context:** Dedicated setup, minimal interruptions
* **Motivation:** Challenge, mastery, optimization, community
* **Skill level:** Expert or aspiring expert, actively studies games
* **Time commitment:** High investment, maintains complex mental models indefinitely

**Design implications:**

* Complex mechanical interactions
* High difficulty acceptable (even desired)
* Deep optimization possibilities
* Skill ceiling more important than skill floor
* Extensive memory/knowledge requirements
* Long-term goals (weeks to months)
* Assume player will study wikis/guides

**Compatible aesthetics:** Mastery, Challenge (extreme), Competition (high stakes), Discovery (deep systems)

**Incompatible aesthetics:** Completion (too easy), Casual Challenge (too simple)

**Examples:** Dark Souls, Path of Exile, Dwarf Fortress, competitive esports

### Special Case: The Busy Adult

**A critical modern demographic that breaks standard categories:**

**Profile:**

* **Available time:** 20-30 minutes per session, unpredictable schedule
* **Cognitive capacity:** High potential but currently limited (parenting, work stress)
* **Gaming experience:** Experienced gamer but rusty skills
* **Motivation:** Meaningful progress in short sessions, feel accomplished
* **Context:** Frequent interruptions, can't maintain complex state between sessions
* **Economic:** High disposable income, willing to pay to skip grind

**Design implications:**

* Compressed loop architecture (complete meso in 20-30 min)
* Aggressive context recaps on resume
* Pauseable/saveable anywhere
* No memorization requirements between sessions
* Respects time (no grinding, no waiting)
* Clear goal reminders
* Meaningful progress every session

**Compatible aesthetics:** Challenge, Completion, Discovery (light), Narrative (episodic)

**Incompatible aesthetics:** Mastery (requires sustained practice), Competition (can't commit to scheduled matches)

**Examples:** Puzzle games, episodic narrative games, roguelikes with short runs

**This profile is underserved** - most games target either casual (too simple for experienced gamers) or hardcore (too demanding for busy lives). Designing for Busy Adults requires the best of both.

### Platform and Social Context

**Platform affects profile:**

* **Mobile** → Assume casual or busy adult, interruptions, short sessions
* **Console** → Can assume longer sessions, couch/TV context
* **PC** → Most flexible, can target any profile
* **Tabletop** → Synchronous social, committed time blocks
* **VR** → Short sessions (comfort), novel experiences

**Social structure affects profile:**

* **Solo play** → Individual pacing, any profile works
* **Asynchronous multiplayer** → Flexible scheduling, casual to midcore
* **Synchronous cooperative** → Requires coordination, midcore to hardcore
* **Synchronous competitive** → High commitment, midcore to hardcore

### Selecting Your Profile

**Questions to determine player profile:**

1. **How much time per session can players commit?**
   * \<30 min → Casual or Busy Adult
   * 30-90 min → Midcore
   * 2+ hours → Hardcore

2. **What's the play context?**
   * Interruption-prone → Casual
   * Occasional interruptions → Midcore
   * Dedicated uninterrupted → Hardcore

3. **What's the cognitive state?**
   * Relaxing, unwinding → Casual
   * Engaged but not exhausted → Midcore
   * Fully focused, studying game → Hardcore

4. **What's the skill expectation?**
   * Accessible to anyone → Casual
   * Willing to learn systems → Midcore
   * Expects deep complexity → Hardcore

5. **What's the commitment level?**
   * Drop in when convenient → Casual or Busy Adult
   * Regular but flexible → Midcore
   * Game is lifestyle/hobby → Hardcore

**Most common mistake:** Trying to serve multiple profiles with one game. Pick one primary profile. You can accommodate others as secondary, but optimize for one.

### Cognitive Load Budget

**From your player profile, you get a cognitive load budget:**

**Casual:** 3-5 trackable elements maximum

* Example: Grid state + moves remaining + goal pattern = 3 elements

**Midcore:** 5-7 trackable elements

* Example: HP + Mana + Cooldowns + Enemy patterns + Objective + Inventory + Map = 7 elements

**Hardcore:** 8+ trackable elements

* Example: Multiple resource pools, complex skill trees, enemy behaviors, optimal rotations, meta-game knowledge, community trends, etc.

**This budget constrains your entire design.** You'll allocate it in Phase 2.

### Validating Player Profile

**Before proceeding, verify:**

**Feasibility Check:**

* [ ] Your aesthetics match this profile (use compatibility lists above)
* [ ] Your constraints support this profile (session length, platform, etc.)
* [ ] This profile has a proven audience for your aesthetic goals
* [ ] You can deliver content/complexity appropriate for this profile

**Focus Check:**

* [ ] You've chosen ONE primary profile (not "casual to hardcore")
* [ ] Secondary profiles are clearly subordinate
* [ ] You're willing to exclude players outside this profile

**If validation fails:**

* Aesthetics don't match profile → Change aesthetics or change profile
* Constraints contradict profile → Change constraints (if possible) or change profile
* Trying to serve multiple profiles → Pick primary, exclude others

***

## Step 1.3: Set Success Criteria

### Why Success Criteria Matter

"I'll know it's good when I play it" is not a plan. You need measurable criteria to:

* Guide design decisions (choose options that serve criteria)
* Validate during playtesting (did we achieve goals?)
* Know when to iterate vs. ship (are success criteria met?)
* Communicate goals to team/collaborators

Success criteria turn vague aesthetics into measurable targets.

### The Three Types of Success Criteria

#### 1. Aesthetic Success

**"What must the game feel like?"**

**For each primary aesthetic, define success:**

**Challenge:**

* "Players feel clever when they win"
* "Losses feel fair, not frustrating"
* "Difficulty feels just right for skill level"

**Discovery:**

* "Players are excited to explore"
* "Secrets feel rewarding to find"
* "World feels rich and deep"

**Mastery:**

* "Players see improvement over time"
* "High skill ceiling is visible"
* "Depth reveals gradually"

**Completion:**

* "Goals are always clear"
* "Finishing feels satisfying"
* "Sessions feel complete"

**Horror:**

* "Players feel dread before reveals"
* "Players recognize their complicity"
* "Experience lingers after play"

**These are qualitative but testable** through player interviews and observation.

#### 2. Measurable Success

**"What numbers indicate we're succeeding?"**

**Reference: Part 6 - Measurables to Numbers**

**For each primary aesthetic, set numeric targets:**

**Challenge:**

* Win rate: 60-80% for casual, 40-60% for midcore, 20-40% for hardcore
* Retry rate: 70%+ (players try again after failure)
* Time to victory: 80-120% of expected time (not too fast, not too slow)

**Discovery:**

* Exploration rate: 60-80% of optional content found
* Time in exploration: 30-50% of total playtime
* Secret discovery rate: 40-60% of secrets found by average player

**Mastery:**

* Improvement curve: Clear skill growth over 10+ sessions
* Skill ceiling: Top 10% of players significantly outperform average
* Practice engagement: 60%+ of players practice to improve

**Completion:**

* Completion rate: 70-90% for casual, 50-70% for midcore, 30-50% for hardcore
* Session satisfaction: 80%+ feel they "finished something"
* Goal clarity: 90%+ always know what to do

**Horror:**

* Tension measurement: Heart rate, reported anxiety (if measurable)
* Discussion rate: 70%+ discuss themes after playing
* Avoidance rate: 20-40% stop playing due to discomfort (success for horror!)

**These numbers are starting targets.** You'll refine them through playtesting.

#### 3. Minimum Viable Aesthetic

**"What's the bare minimum that must work?"**

Identify the core aesthetic moment—the single experience that must succeed for your game to work.

**Examples:**

**Puzzle game:** "The moment of solving a puzzle must feel satisfying"

* If this doesn't work, nothing else matters
* Everything else supports this moment

**Horror game:** "The moment of realizing complicity must land"

* If players don't feel implicated, the game failed
* Everything builds to this revelation

**Mastery game:** "The moment of executing a perfect combo must feel earned"

* If execution doesn't feel skillful, game is hollow
* Everything enables this moment

**Roguelike:** "The moment of starting a new run must feel exciting, not tedious"

* If runs feel like chores, game is dead
* Everything must make runs feel fresh

**Your minimum viable aesthetic is non-negotiable.** If playtesting shows it's not working, you iterate until it does or you pivot the entire design.

### Setting Your Success Criteria

**Complete this template:**

**Aesthetic Success Criteria:**

* Primary Aesthetic 1: \[What must this feel like?]
* Primary Aesthetic 2: \[What must this feel like?]
* Secondary Aesthetic: \[What should this feel like?]

**Measurable Success Criteria:**

* Primary Aesthetic 1: \[Numeric target]
* Primary Aesthetic 2: \[Numeric target]
* Overall: \[Session length, retention rate, or other meta-metric]

**Minimum Viable Aesthetic:**

* \[The one moment/experience that must work]

**Failure Conditions:**

* \[What would indicate complete failure?]
* \[At what point would you pivot?]

**Example: Daily Puzzle Game (Busy Parents)**

**Aesthetic Success:**

* Challenge: "Players feel clever when solving, not frustrated when stuck"
* Completion: "Finishing puzzle feels like accomplishing something meaningful"
* Discovery: "New puzzle each session feels fresh, not repetitive"

**Measurable Success:**

* Win rate: 70-80% (accessible but satisfying)
* Session length: 20-30 minutes average
* Return rate: 60%+ come back next session
* Hint usage: 20-30% (safety net, not crutch)

**Minimum Viable Aesthetic:**

* "The moment of placing the final tile and seeing the complete pattern must feel satisfying"

**Failure Conditions:**

* Win rate \<50% (too hard, players give up)
* Win rate >90% (too easy, no satisfaction)
* Session length >45 min (too long for busy adults)
* Return rate \<40% (not engaging enough)

**Example: Horror TTRPG One-Shot (Colonial Horror)**

**Aesthetic Success:**

* Horror: "Players feel dread as they make decisions, then realization of complicity"
* Discovery: "Gradually uncovering truth feels like investigation, not exposition"
* Fellowship: "Group makes decisions together, shares responsibility"

**Measurable Success:**

* Session length: 3-4 hours (complete in one sitting)
* Discussion engagement: 70%+ discuss themes after play
* Complicity recognition: 80%+ players acknowledge their role
* Tension maintenance: \<10% breaks in horror tone

**Minimum Viable Aesthetic:**

* "The revelation moment where players realize they are the colonizers must land emotionally, not intellectually"

**Failure Conditions:**

* Feels didactic (players feel lectured, not implicated)
* Becomes action game (combat focus breaks horror)
* Players disengage (avoidance without processing)
* Revelation obvious (no discovery, just confirmation)

### Validating Success Criteria

**Before proceeding, verify:**

**Measurability Check:**

* [ ] Success criteria can be observed/measured
* [ ] You know how to test for them
* [ ] Criteria are specific, not vague
* [ ] You'll know success from failure

**Achievability Check:**

* [ ] Criteria are possible within constraints
* [ ] Not setting contradictory targets
* [ ] Numbers are realistic for aesthetic/profile
* [ ] Minimum viable aesthetic is achievable

**Completeness Check:**

* [ ] All primary aesthetics have criteria
* [ ] Measurable targets align with aesthetic targets
* [ ] Minimum viable aesthetic is clearly identified
* [ ] Failure conditions are explicit

**If validation fails:**

* Criteria too vague → Make specific and measurable
* Contradictory targets → Prioritize, resolve conflicts
* Unrealistic goals → Adjust targets or adjust aesthetic goals
* Missing criteria → Add for all primary aesthetics

## Moving to Phase 2

**Before proceeding to Phase 2, validate:**

* [ ] You can explain your aesthetic goals to someone in 2 minutes
* [ ] You know who your players are and what they can handle
* [ ] You have measurable criteria to test against
* [ ] You've identified your minimum viable aesthetic
* [ ] Primary aesthetics are compatible (check recipes)
* [ ] Player profile matches aesthetic requirements
* [ ] Success criteria are achievable within constraints

**If any of these aren't true, revisit the relevant step in Phase 1.**

**Common reasons to iterate Phase 1:**

* Aesthetics conflict (check recipes, prioritize or exclude)
* Player profile doesn't match aesthetics (choose one or the other)
* Success criteria unrealistic (adjust targets or aesthetic goals)
* Too many primary aesthetics (narrow focus to 1-2)
* Minimum viable aesthetic unclear (identify core moment)

**When Phase 1 is solid, proceed to Phase 2: Scaffold Architecture.**

Phase 2 will help you:

* Choose the structural pattern that serves your aesthetics
* Design temporal structure (loops, acts, pacing)
* Allocate your cognitive load budget
* Ensure architecture supports aesthetic goals

**Your aesthetic profile is now the lens through which all design decisions will be made.** Every mechanic, resource, and parameter will justify itself by serving these aesthetic goals for these players within these constraints.

***

**Turn to Phase 2 when ready to continue.**
