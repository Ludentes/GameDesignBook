# Phase 2: Scaffold Architecture - What Structure Supports Your Aesthetics?

## Overview

Phase 2 determines the fundamental structure of your game - the scaffold that players will climb to reach your aesthetic goals. This isn't about specific rules yet (that's Phase 3), but about the architectural pattern that organizes play.

Different aesthetics and player profiles require different scaffolds. A daily puzzle game needs different architecture than a murder mystery. A roguelike needs different structure than a walking simulator.

## Step 2.1: Choose Structural Pattern

### Understanding Structural Patterns

Your game will use one of these fundamental patterns. Each serves different aesthetics and creates different play experiences.

#### Pattern A: Loop-Based Architecture

**What it is:** Repeating cycles of play at multiple time scales - micro, meso, and macro loops.

**Best for:**

* Action games (combat, platformers)
* Roguelikes (run-based progression)
* Strategy games (turn-based or real-time)
* Most video games with continuous play

**Core characteristic:** Players repeat actions at small scale (micro), which accumulate toward medium-term goals (meso), which feed into long-term progression (macro).

**When to use:**

* Players will repeat core actions many times
* Progress accumulates over time
* Mastery comes from getting better at loops
* Session structure: multiple micro-loops per session

**Loop Architecture Types:**

**Full Stack (micro + meso + macro):**

* All three loop scales present
* Long-term progression games
* Examples: Hades (combat encounter → escape attempt → meta-progression), Civilization (turn → era → full game)
* Best for: Hardcore players, extended play sessions, deep progression

**Compressed (micro + meso only):**

* No macro loop or very light macro
* Session-complete games
* Examples: Wordle (guess → daily puzzle), Into the Breach (turn → mission)
* Best for: Casual to midcore, time-limited sessions, pick-up-and-play

**Inverted (macro-heavy or macro-only):**

* Minimal micro interaction, focus on long-term growth
* Examples: Idle/incremental games, some management sims
* Best for: Very casual, async play, minimal active engagement

**Constrained (single loop scale):**

* One dominant loop scale
* Examples: Tetris (only micro), some puzzle games
* Best for: Pure gameplay focus, no meta-progression needed

**Reference:** See "Temporal Architecture: Loops as Scaffolding" chapter for detailed loop design patterns.

***

#### Pattern B: Narrative Arc Architecture

**What it is:** Linear or branching story progression through acts/scenes/beats. Not cyclical - players move forward through a narrative.

**Best for:**

* Story-driven games (walking simulators, visual novels)
* TTRPGs (one-shots, campaigns with story focus)
* Investigation/mystery games
* Games where discovery is one-way (can't unknow information)

**Core characteristic:** Players move through structured narrative beats. Pacing follows dramatic structure (rising action, climax, resolution) rather than repeating loops.

**When to use:**

* Story/narrative is primary aesthetic
* Discovery is one-way (revealing truth, uncovering secrets)
* Players shouldn't repeat the same experience
* Session structure: scenes or decision points, not repeated actions

**Arc Structure Types:**

**Three-Act Structure:**

* Setup → Confrontation → Resolution
* Examples: Most one-shot TTRPGs, many story games
* Duration: Single session (3-6 hours) or short campaign

**Five-Act Structure:**

* Exposition → Rising Action → Climax → Falling Action → Resolution
* Examples: Longer campaigns, episodic games
* Duration: Multiple sessions or chapters

**Scene-Based Structure:**

* Discrete scenes with decision points
* Branching or linear progression
* Examples: Interactive fiction, mystery investigations
* Duration: Varies by scene count

**What replaces "loops" in narrative arc:**

* **Micro-moments:** Individual interactions (investigation action, dialogue choice, examination)
* **Scenes:** Complete interactions (interrogate suspect, explore location, make major choice)
* **Acts:** Major narrative movements (discovery phase, investigation phase, resolution phase)

**Critical difference from loops:** You don't repeat the same structure. Each scene is unique. Progress is one-way.

***

#### Pattern C: Puzzle Architecture

**What it is:** Discrete, self-contained challenges with solutions. Each puzzle is separate.

**Best for:**

* Pure puzzle games (Sudoku, crosswords)
* Puzzle-platformers (individual rooms/challenges)
* Brain teasers and logic games

**Core characteristic:** Each puzzle is complete in itself. Solving one puzzle doesn't mechanically affect the next (though player skill improves).

**When to use:**

* Challenge aesthetic is primary
* Each session = complete one or more puzzles
* No meta-progression needed (or minimal)
* Clear success criteria (solved or not)

**Puzzle Structure Types:**

**Sequential Puzzles:**

* Solve puzzle 1 → unlock puzzle 2 → etc.
* Examples: The Witness, Portal
* Progression through difficulty/complexity

**Independent Puzzles:**

* Each puzzle standalone
* Examples: Daily puzzle games, puzzle collections
* No ordering required

**Nested Puzzles:**

* Solving small puzzles contributes to larger puzzle
* Examples: Escape rooms, some adventure games
* Combination of micro and macro puzzle solving

**What replaces "loops":**

* **Attempt:** Single try at solving puzzle
* **Puzzle:** Complete challenge (may take multiple attempts)
* **Collection:** Set of puzzles (optional meta-structure)

***

#### Pattern D: Exploration Architecture

**What it is:** Space-based progression where players navigate, discover, and unlock new areas.

**Best for:**

* Metroidvanias (gated exploration)
* Open-world discovery games
* Walking simulators

**Core characteristic:** Progress measured by what you've discovered and where you can go, not by repeating loops or following narrative beats.

**When to use:**

* Discovery aesthetic is primary
* Spatial navigation is core
* Unlocking new areas drives progression
* Non-linear exploration valued

**Exploration Structure Types:**

**Gated Exploration (Metroidvania):**

* Abilities unlock new areas
* Backtracking reveals new paths
* Examples: Hollow Knight, Metroid

**Open-World Discovery:**

* Large space, player-directed exploration
* Examples: Outer Wilds, Breath of the Wild

**Linear Exploration:**

* Guided path through spaces
* Examples: Walking simulators, many narrative games

**What replaces "loops":**

* **Navigation:** Moving through space
* **Discovery:** Finding new locations/secrets
* **Unlocking:** Gaining access to previously gated areas

***

#### Pattern E: Progression Architecture

**What it is:** Numerical advancement and power growth as primary structure.

**Best for:**

* RPGs (character building)
* Incremental/idle games
* Collection-focused games

**Core characteristic:** Progress measured by numbers going up - levels, stats, collection completion.

**When to use:**

* Power fantasy aesthetic
* Long-term growth is motivating
* Optimization and builds are interesting
* Sessions show measurable advancement

**Progression Structure Types:**

**Level-Based:**

* Discrete advancement tiers
* Examples: Traditional RPGs, many mobile games

**Continuous Growth:**

* Smooth numerical progression
* Examples: Idle games, some MMOs

**Collection-Based:**

* Progress = % of total collected
* Examples: Pokémon, collectathons

**What replaces "loops":**

* **Grinding:** Repeated actions for resources/XP
* **Advancement:** Spending resources to grow stronger
* **Optimization:** Choosing how to specialize/build

***

### Pattern Selection Decision Matrix

Use this table to narrow options based on aesthetics and player profile:

| Primary Aesthetic | Casual Players                    | Midcore Players              | Hardcore Players            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Challenge         | Compressed Loops or Puzzle        | Full Stack Loops or Puzzle   | Full Stack Loops            |
| Discovery         | Compressed Loops or Narrative Arc | Exploration or Narrative Arc | Exploration or Full Stack   |
| Mastery           | Puzzle or Compressed Loops        | Full Stack Loops             | Full Stack Loops (complex)  |
| Narrative         | Narrative Arc                     | Narrative Arc                | Narrative Arc or Full Stack |
| Horror            | Narrative Arc                     | Narrative Arc                | Narrative Arc               |
| Fellowship        | Depends on social structure       |                              |                             |
| Expression        | Progression or Loops              | Progression or Loops         | Complex Loops               |
| Competition       | Compressed Loops                  | Full Stack Loops             | Full Stack Loops            |

**Additional factors:**

**Session Length:**

* Very short (\<10 min) → Puzzle or Compressed Loops
* Short (10-30 min) → Compressed Loops or Puzzle
* Medium (30-90 min) → Any pattern possible
* Long (2+ hours) → Full Stack Loops, Narrative Arc, Exploration
* Single session complete → Compressed Loops, Narrative Arc, Puzzle

**Replayability Needs:**

* High replayability → Loop-based (players repeat)
* Low replayability → Narrative Arc (one-time experience)
* Puzzle replayability → Depends on procedural generation

**Content Creation Capacity:**

* Limited content → Loop-based (reuse content through mastery)
* Moderate content → Puzzle, Compressed Loops
* High content → Narrative Arc, Exploration, Full Stack

***

### Worked Example: Murder Mystery TTRPG

**Aesthetic Profile:** Horror (complicity) + Discovery + Fellowship
**Player Profile:** Adults, 4-6 hour session, moderate to high cognitive load
**Constraints:** TTRPG, investigation-focused, fair-play mystery

**Pattern Analysis:**

**Loop-Based? NO**

* Investigation doesn't loop (you don't re-investigate same murder)
* Discovery is one-way (once you know whodunit, can't unknow it)
* No repeated core actions at micro scale

**Narrative Arc? YES**

* Clear three-act structure: Discovery → Investigation → Accusation
* Pacing follows dramatic tension (clues accumulate, suspicion builds)
* One-way progression toward solution
* Story-driven experience

**Puzzle? PARTIALLY**

* The mystery IS a puzzle
* But experienced through narrative, not as discrete challenge
* Social interaction and interrogation are key, not just logic

**Exploration? NO**

* Not space-based navigation
* Locations exist but aren't the primary structure

**Progression? NO**

* No character advancement
* No numbers going up
* One-shot means no meta-progression

**Decision: Narrative Arc Architecture**

***

## Step 2.2: Design Temporal Structure

Now that you've chosen your structural pattern, specify the temporal organization.

### For Loop-Based Architectures

**Define your loop scales:**

**Micro Loop (1-5 minutes):**

* What's the smallest repeating action?
* How long does one iteration take?
* What's the core verb? (shoot, move, match, build)
* What immediate feedback happens?

**Meso Loop (10-60 minutes):**

* What's the medium-term goal?
* How many micro loops per meso completion?
* What's the payoff for completing meso?
* Does it end session or continue?

**Macro Loop (hours to weeks):**

* What's the long-term progression?
* How many meso loops to advance macro?
* What persists between sessions?
* What's the ultimate goal?

**Example: Roguelike**

* Micro: Combat encounter (2-3 min) → defeat enemies, choose rewards
* Meso: Full run attempt (30-60 min) → reach end or die
* Macro: Meta-progression (20+ runs) → unlock new characters/items

**Pacing considerations:**

* Micro loop must feel responsive (tight feedback)
* Meso loop must provide sense of progress
* Macro loop must motivate return

***

### For Narrative Arc Architectures

**Define your act structure:**

**Acts (major narrative movements):**

* How many acts? (typically 3-5)
* What's the purpose of each act?
* How long per act?
* What's the climax of each?

**Scenes (discrete interactions):**

* How many scenes per act?
* How long per scene?
* What happens in each scene?
* What moves players to next scene?

**Beats (micro-moments):**

* What are the smallest interactions?
* How do beats build into scenes?
* What player actions happen at beat level?

**Example: Murder Mystery TTRPG**

**Act 1: Discovery (60-90 min)**

* Scene 1: Murder discovered, crime scene
* Scene 2: Initial interviews with suspects
* Scene 3: First theorizing session
* Beats: Individual investigation actions (examine body, search desk, question witness)

**Act 2: Investigation (120-180 min)**

* Scene 4-8: Deep investigation of suspects/locations
* Each scene = interrogate one suspect OR search one location
* Beats: Ask questions, challenge with evidence, find clues
* Revelation: Major secret revealed that shifts theories

**Act 3: Resolution (60-90 min)**

* Scene 9: Build final case
* Scene 10: Confront culprit with evidence
* Scene 11: Resolution and epilogue
* Beats: Present evidence, argue logic, resolve other secrets

**Micro-moments (beats) = 2-5 min each:**

* "I examine the body" → GM describes findings
* "I ask about their alibi" → NPC responds
* "I search the desk" → GM reveals clues
* These accumulate into scenes

**Scenes = 15-40 min each:**

* Complete investigation of one location
* Complete interrogation of one suspect
* Multiple beats per scene

**Acts = 60-180 min each:**

* Major narrative movement
* Multiple scenes per act
* Clear dramatic purpose

**Pacing rhythm:**

* Start with action (murder discovery)
* Build tension (clues accumulate, contradictions emerge)
* Accelerate toward climax (pieces fall into place)
* Satisfying resolution (confrontation, truth revealed)

***

### For Puzzle Architectures

**Define puzzle structure:**

**Individual Puzzle:**

* How long to attempt one puzzle? (1-20 min typical)
* How many attempts before solution or failure?
* Clear success criteria?
* Difficulty level?

**Puzzle Collection:**

* How many puzzles total?
* Ordered or player-choice?
* Difficulty curve?
* Meta-structure connecting puzzles?

**Example: Daily Puzzle Game**

* Single puzzle per day (5-15 min to complete)
* Unlimited attempts within day
* Compressed structure: micro = attempt, meso = daily puzzle
* No macro (each day independent)

***

### For Exploration Architectures

**Define spatial structure:**

**Navigation Scale:**

* How large is explorable space?
* How long to traverse?
* What blocks progress?

**Discovery Frequency:**

* How often do players find something new?
* What counts as "discovery"?
* How much backtracking?

**Example: Metroidvania**

* Large interconnected map
* Abilities gate areas (double-jump unlocks high areas)
* Discovery every 5-10 min (new room, secret, upgrade)
* Backtracking after new abilities (revisit with new access)

***

### For Progression Architectures

**Define advancement structure:**

**Growth Rate:**

* How quickly do numbers increase?
* Linear or exponential growth?
* Soft caps or hard caps?

**Advancement Frequency:**

* How often does player level up / advance?
* What triggers advancement?
* What changes with advancement?

**Example: Traditional RPG**

* Level every 2-3 hours of play
* Experience from combat and quests
* Each level: stat increases, new abilities, equipment access

***

## Step 2.3: Allocate Cognitive Load

Reference the Cognitive Load chapter for detailed treatment. Here we apply it to scaffold design.

### Understanding Cognitive Load Budget

Your player profile determines total cognitive capacity:

* **Casual:** LOW budget (3±2 trackable elements)
* **Midcore:** MEDIUM budget (5-7 systems)
* **Hardcore:** HIGH budget (complex systems welcome)
* **Busy Adults:** LOW but experienced (simple now, can grow)

### Distribution Across Game Elements

Your scaffold architecture determines what needs cognitive space:

**For Loop-Based Games:**

* Core loop mechanics: 30-40%
* Resource management: 20-30%
* Goal tracking: 15-20%
* Meta-progression: 10-20%
* Social/communication: 10% (if multiplayer)

**For Narrative Arc Games:**

* Information tracking: 40-50% (who said what, what evidence, what secrets)
* Deduction/reasoning: 25-30% (connecting clues, forming theories)
* Social/roleplay: 15-20% (in-character interaction)
* System rules: 5-10% (should be minimal)

**For Puzzle Games:**

* Puzzle mechanics: 50-60% (understanding the puzzle)
* Current state: 20-30% (what's on board right now)
* Goal tracking: 10-15% (what am I trying to achieve)
* Meta-progression: 5-10% (optional)

### Critical Principle: Primary Aesthetic Gets Priority

Whatever aesthetic is primary should get the largest share of cognitive load.

**Discovery-heavy game:**

* Information tracking gets most space
* Keep mechanics simple to free cognitive load for discovery

**Challenge-heavy game:**

* Tactical decision-making gets most space
* Clear goal states, don't make players track complex information

**Mastery-heavy game:**

* System depth gets most space
* Players willing to learn complexity for optimization

**Narrative-heavy game:**

* Story tracking gets most space
* Mechanics should be intuitive, not require study

### Worked Example: Murder Mystery Cognitive Load

**Player Profile:** Adults, high cognitive tolerance for THIS type of complexity

**Total Budget:** HIGH (but only for mystery-relevant information)

**Distribution:**

```
Information Tracking: 50%
  - Who each suspect is (names, relationships)
  - What each person claims (their story/alibi)
  - What evidence exists (physical clues)
  - Contradictions (who's lying about what)
  - Secrets revealed (layered information)
  - Timeline (what happened when)
  
  Why so much? This IS the game. Players WANT to track this.

Deduction/Reasoning: 30%
  - Forming theories (who could have done it?)
  - Spotting contradictions (A says X, but evidence shows Y)
  - Connecting clues (this means that because...)
  - Evaluating suspects (motive, means, opportunity)
  
  Why significant? Core Challenge aesthetic.

Social/Roleplay: 15%
  - Interrogation approach (aggressive vs. sympathetic)
  - In-character questioning
  - Reading NPCs (are they nervous? lying?)
  
  Why moderate? Supports investigation, not primary focus.

System Rules: 5%
  - How investigation works (describe action → GM reveals)
  - When to roll dice (rarely)
  - How to challenge with evidence (show proof → NPC responds)
  
  Why minimal? System should be invisible, not add burden.
```

**Key Insight:** The cognitive load players want to spend (tracking mystery information) is EXACTLY what the game requires. The system doesn't compete with this - it supports it.

**What This Means for Design:**

* No complex combat system (would compete for cognitive space)
* No character building/leveling (would distract)
* Minimal dice rolling (don't make players learn probability math)
* Physical evidence cards (external tracking, not memory)
* Clear NPC tracking sheet (tool to manage information)

### Tools to Manage Cognitive Load

**External Aids:**

* Character sheets (offload stat memory)
* Maps (offload spatial memory)
* Quest logs (offload goal memory)
* Evidence cards (offload clue memory)
* Timeline boards (offload event sequence)

**Design Simplifications:**

* Fewer resources (3-5 max)
* Clear icons/labels (reduce interpretation load)
* Consistent patterns (learn once, apply everywhere)
* Tutorials that teach (don't make players figure out system)

**Information Architecture:**

* Reveal complexity gradually
* Start simple, add depth
* Don't front-load everything
* Let players discover systems organically

### Red Flags: Cognitive Overload

**Warning signs:**

* Players asking "wait, how does this work?" repeatedly
* Players ignoring entire systems (too much to track)
* Players frustrated, not challenged
* Tutorial takes >20% of session time
* More than 7 separate systems/resources to track

**Solutions:**

* Cut systems that don't serve primary aesthetic
* Combine related systems (fewer categories)
* Provide external tracking tools
* Simplify mechanics, keep depth in application

***

## Validation Questions for Phase 2

Before proceeding to Phase 3, verify:

**Structural Pattern:**

* [ ] Pattern matches primary aesthetic (loops for repetition, narrative for story, puzzle for challenge)
* [ ] Pattern fits player profile (casual can handle this structure?)
* [ ] Pattern suits session length (can complete meaningful unit in available time?)
* [ ] If loop-based: Do you need all three scales, or can you simplify?
* [ ] If narrative arc: Is pacing appropriate for aesthetic (horror needs slow build, action needs momentum)?

**Temporal Structure:**

* [ ] Each time scale has clear purpose
* [ ] Scales connect logically (micro → meso → macro)
* [ ] Durations match player session availability
* [ ] Pacing serves aesthetic goals (tension/release rhythm appropriate?)
* [ ] If one-shot: Can it complete in one session?
* [ ] If persistent: What carries over between sessions?

**Cognitive Load:**

* [ ] Total load within player profile budget
* [ ] Primary aesthetic gets priority allocation
* [ ] System complexity justified by aesthetic value
* [ ] External tools provided for heavy information tracking
* [ ] No competing systems (everything serves same goal)
* [ ] Can remove any element without breaking core experience? (if yes, remove it)

**Common Issues to Catch:**

**"Missing Meso Loop" Problem:**

* If loop-based but no medium-term goal → Add meso structure
* Players need goals achievable in 10-30 minutes
* Most failed games lack satisfying meso loop

**"Cognitive Overload" Problem:**

* More than 7 trackable elements → Simplify
* Complex systems not serving primary aesthetic → Cut them
* Players spending more time learning system than experiencing aesthetic → Reduce system complexity

**"Wrong Pattern" Problem:**

* Using loops for one-shot narrative → Switch to narrative arc
* Using narrative arc for repeated play → Switch to loops
* Using puzzle for social experience → Reconsider

**"Pacing Mismatch" Problem:**

* Horror game with frantic pacing → Slow down, build dread
* Action game with slow pacing → Accelerate, maintain momentum
* Discovery game revealing everything at once → Spread revelations

***

## Output from Phase 2

You should now have:

1. **Structural Pattern Choice**
   * Which pattern (loops, narrative, puzzle, exploration, progression)
   * Why this pattern serves your aesthetics
   * Any hybrid elements

2. **Complete Temporal Specification**
   * For loops: Micro/meso/macro definitions with durations
   * For narrative: Act/scene/beat structure with timing
   * For puzzles: Puzzle structure and collection organization
   * For exploration: Spatial structure and discovery pacing
   * For progression: Advancement rate and structure

3. **Cognitive Load Allocation**
   * Total budget (from player profile)
   * Distribution across game elements
   * What gets priority (primary aesthetic)
   * What's minimized (supporting elements)
   * External tools to provide

**Example Complete Phase 2 Output:**

```
MURDER MYSTERY TTRPG

Structural Pattern: Narrative Arc Architecture
- Three-act structure (Discovery → Investigation → Resolution)

Act 1 (60-90 min): Murder discovery, crime scene, initial interviews
Act 2 (120-180 min): Deep investigation, following leads, challenging alibis
Act 3 (60-90 min): Building case, confrontation, resolution

Cognitive Load:
Total Budget: HIGH (adult mystery fans)
- Information tracking: 50% (mystery details)
- Deduction: 30% (solving puzzle)
- Social: 15% (interrogation)
- System rules: 5% (minimal mechanics)

Tools: Evidence cards, suspect tracking sheet, timeline board
Priority: Investigation discovery over system mastery
```

***

## Moving to Phase 3

With your scaffold architecture defined, you're ready to specify the actual system elements - the rules, resources, and parameters that bring your scaffold to life.

Phase 3 will define:

* Core verbs (what players DO)
* System elements (rules governing those verbs)
* Resources (what players track and manage)
* Parameters (numeric values and ranges)

Your Phase 2 decisions constrain Phase 3:

* Your structural pattern determines which system elements you need
* Your temporal structure determines pacing requirements
* Your cognitive load allocation determines system complexity

Proceed to Phase 3 when ready.
