# Archetype 4: Cozy Life Sim

## Overview

Relaxing games about slow-paced activities like farming, decorating, building relationships, and collecting. Emphasizes calm aesthetics, player agency, creative expression, and positive feedback. No failure states, no time pressure, progression at player's own pace. Sessions 20 minutes to several hours.

## Primary Aesthetics

* **Expression** (creativity, customization, personal style)
* **Discovery** (finding new items, recipes, characters)
* **Fellowship** (building relationships with NPCs or players)
* **Collection** (completing sets, filling museums, achieving 100%)
* Explicitly NOT: Challenge (no difficulty), Horror (positive tone only)

## Player Profile Match

**Best For:** Relaxation-seekers, creators, completionists, routine-builders
**Works Well For:** All skill levels (casual to hardcore), varied session lengths
**Works Less Well For:** Challenge-seekers, action-oriented, impatient players
**Cognitive Load:** Low to Moderate (3-8 elements, no time pressure)

## Temporal Structure

**Architecture Type:** Full Stack but Flexible Pacing

* **Micro:** 1-5min (single activity: water plant, catch fish, talk to NPC)
* **Meso:** 20-60min per session (complete daily tasks, progress on project)
* **Macro:** Weeks to months (seasonal content, complete collections, full decoration)
  **Pacing:** No rushing, real-time gating common, daily login bonuses without pressure

## Common Mechanics

1. **Gather:** Collect resources (foraging, mining, fishing) - renewable daily/seasonally
2. **Craft:** Transform resources (cooking, building, crafting) - recipes unlock gradually
3. **Decorate:** Arrange items in personal space - extensive options (hundreds of items)
4. **Socialize:** Build NPC relationships - gifting, dialogue, relationship levels
5. **Care:** Maintain environment (watering, feeding) - gentle responsibility
6. **Collect:** Find all items in categories - percentage tracking
7. **No Failure:** Can't die or lose, mistakes are minor and recoverable

## Resource Patterns

**Primary (Abundant/Renewable):** Gathering materials (wood, stone, fish), Currency (earned steadily), Energy/stamina (gentle limit, daily recovery), Time (soft limit, creates rhythm not pressure)
**Meta:** Unlocks (gradual progression), Relationship points (slow accumulation), Collection completion
All resources support relaxation aesthetic - never punishing scarcity.

## Content Needs

**MVP:** 50-100 gather items, 100-200 craftables, 30-50 recipes, 10-20 NPCs, 3-5 biomes, 4 seasons
**Sustainable:** 200-400 gatherables, 500-1000 furniture, 100-200 recipes, 30-50 NPCs, 10-15 biomes, monthly events
**Formula:** Discovery + Expression = high content needs. 100-300 hours to "complete" but most play indefinitely.

## Platform Considerations

**Best:** Console/PC (full experience), Switch (ideal portable+home), Mobile (simplified UI, shorter sessions)
**Tech Needs:** Seamless save/resume, low performance requirements, lots of asset variety, real-time clock integration, cloud save

## Monetization Patterns

**Premium Common:** $20-60 one-time, expansion DLC adds areas/NPCs/items
**F2P Mobile:** Energy systems, cosmetic purchases, time skips, seasonal battle pass
**Live Service:** Monthly events, battle pass, expansion content packs
**Anti-Patterns:** Pay-to-win, aggressive monetization, PvP with monetization breaks cozy aesthetic

## Social Features

**Asynchronous Common:** Visit others' farms/islands, leave gifts/messages, show off creations, non-competitive leaderboards
**Synchronous Rare:** Local co-op, online multiplayer (usually optional)
**Community Strong:** Photo sharing, design showcases, trading, helpful non-toxic community

## Success Metrics

1. DAU retention (players return daily/regularly)
2. Session length: 30-120 minutes typical
3. Completion percentage: Very few complete (50-200 hours)
4. Engagement window: 3-12 months typical, some indefinite
5. Social sharing: Screenshot/design sharing common
6. Event participation: 60-80% engage with seasonal content

## Common Variations

* **Farming Sim:** Stardew Valley (crop focus)
* **Life Sim:** Animal Crossing (social + decoration)
* **Crafting Sim:** Minecraft creative (building focus)
* **Pet/Creature Sim:** Care + collection focus
* **Decoration Sim:** Pure expression (interior design)

## Design Pitfalls

1. Too grindy (feels like work, not relaxation)
2. Too many systems (cognitive overload defeats cozy purpose)
3. Harsh penalties (wilted crops feel bad if punishing)
4. Unclear goals (players don't know what to do)
5. Boring early game (takes too long to unlock interesting activities)
6. Tedious repetition (same action 100 times without variety)
7. Aggressive monetization (breaks cozy aesthetic with pressure)
8. Too much FOMO (creates anxiety, not fun)

## Example Games

* Animal Crossing: New Horizons (island decoration, social, collection)
* Stardew Valley (farming, relationships, exploration)
* My Time at Portia/Sandrock (crafting, building, relationships)
* Disney Dreamlight Valley (IP integration, decoration)
* Unpacking (pure decoration, minimalist, zen)

## When This Archetype Fails

* Players want challenge or skill expression (no difficulty)
* Players need fast-paced action (too slow and contemplative)
* Short development time (needs lots of content)
* Competitive focus (conflicts with cozy aesthetic)
* Can't support ongoing content (needs seasonal updates for retention)
* Target audience wants meaningful failure states
* Real-time elements frustrate (players want instant progress)
