# Archetype 3: 4X Strategy Game

## Overview

"Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate" - grand strategy games about civilization building and conquest. Players manage empires over many turns, balancing economic development, military power, technological advancement, and diplomatic relations. Long sessions (2-8 hours) with complex interlocking systems and emergent narratives.

## Primary Aesthetics

* **Mastery** (optimization of complex systems)
* **Power** (building dominant civilization)
* **Discovery** (map exploration, tech trees)
* **Challenge** (AI or player opponents)
* Optional: **Expression** (different playstyles, empire customization)

## Player Profile Match

**Best For:** Hardcore strategy fans, long-session players, systems thinkers, replay-focused
**Works Less Well For:** Casual players, action-oriented, story-focused, quick-session players
**Cognitive Load:** Very High (15-30+ trackable systems including resources, tech tree, units, cities, diplomacy)

## Temporal Structure

**Architecture Type:** Inverted Macro-Heavy

* **Micro:** 30sec-2min per turn (issue orders, manage cities)
* **Meso:** 30-90min per era/age (complete tech era, win a war)
* **Macro:** 3-12 hours per complete game (ancient to future)

## Common Mechanics

1. Turn-based progression (simultaneous or sequential)
2. Territory control (map divided into regions)
3. Multiple resource types (5-10: food, production, gold, science, culture, strategic)
4. Technology tree (50-200 technologies, branching paths)
5. Unit-based warfare (20-50 unit types with counters)
6. City/settlement management (produce units, buildings, wonders)
7. Diplomacy (trade, alliances, wars)
8. Victory conditions (conquest, science, culture, diplomacy, score)

## Resource Patterns

**Primary:** Food (population), Production (output), Gold (economy), Science (research), Culture (policy), Strategic resources (iron, oil, location-dependent)
**Meta:** Territory (finite), Time (limited turns), Diplomatic capital
All resources renewable but require management and optimization.

## Content Needs

**MVP:** 4-8 civilizations, 50-100 technologies, 20-30 units, 30-50 buildings, 3-5 victory types
**Sustainable:** 12-20 civs, 100-200 techs, 50-80 units, 80-120 buildings, 5-8 victories, multiple maps, scenario editor
**Formula:** Strategic depth from combinations, not raw content volume. 200-1000+ hours expected playtime.

## Platform Considerations

**Best:** PC (complex UI, mouse essential, mod support)
**Possible:** Console (simplified UI), Tablets (redesigned interface)
**Difficult:** Mobile (too complex, screen too small, sessions too long)
**Tech Needs:** Save/load any turn, fast AI processing, multiplayer sync, large map streaming

## Monetization Patterns

**Premium Standard:** Base game $30-60, major expansions $20-40 (add civs/mechanics), minor DLC $5-15
**Live Service Growing:** Seasonal content, battle pass, competitive tournaments
**F2P:** Rare for traditional 4X, doesn't suit genre depth

## Social Features

**Multiplayer Complex:** Asynchronous (play by email), Synchronous (simultaneous turns), Hot seat, Co-op vs AI
**Community:** Mod support (critical), scenario sharing, strategy guides, multiplayer lobbies, streaming
Sessions can take 8-20 hours total for multiplayer games.

## Success Metrics

1. Average session length: 2-4 hours (6-8 for engaged)
2. Games completed: Many never finish
3. Replays per purchase: 3-10 typical, 20-100+ for mastery players
4. DLC attachment rate: 40-70% (very high)
5. Mod usage: 30-60% on PC
6. Time to first win: 10-30 hours

## Common Variations

* **Historical:** Civilization series (real history)
* **Sci-Fi:** Stellaris, Endless Space (future/alien)
* **Fantasy:** Endless Legend, Age of Wonders (magic/monsters)
* **Asymmetric:** Different factions play completely differently
* **Simplified:** Streamlined for accessibility

## Design Pitfalls

1. Too complex (>30 systems overwhelming)
2. Runaway leader (winner obvious early)
3. Tedious late game (too many cities/units)
4. Dominant strategy (one path clearly best)
5. Poor AI (too weak or obvious cheating)
6. Analysis paralysis (too many equal choices)
7. Weak early game (boring until hour 3)
8. Missing meso goals (no achievements between turn 1 and 200)

## Example Games

* Civilization VI (historical, districts, multiple victories)
* Stellaris (sci-fi, real-time with pause, story events)
* Endless Legend (fantasy, asymmetric factions)
* Old World (historical, character events, orders)
* Humankind (culture switching, fame)

## When This Archetype Fails

* Players want action/combat focus (too slow and cerebral)
* Sessions shorter than 2 hours (can't make meaningful progress)
* Casual audience (far too complex)
* Mobile/on-the-go context (sessions too long, UI too complex)
* Limited replayability tolerance (needs massive content or procedural)
* Budget can't support complexity (extensive testing/balancing needed)
* Players want strong narrative (emergent stories, not authored plot)
