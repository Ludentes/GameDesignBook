# Archetype 5: One-Shot TTRPG

## Overview

Tabletop roleplaying games designed for single-session completion (3-5 hours). Emphasizes narrative arc, collaborative storytelling, and complete experience without ongoing campaign commitment. GM-facilitated with flexible structure to accommodate player choices while maintaining pacing toward conclusion.

## Primary Aesthetics

* **Narrative** (story arc with beginning, middle, end)
* **Fellowship** (collaborative creation, social bonding)
* **Discovery** (uncovering plot, world, or themes)
* Variable: Challenge, Horror, Expression depending on specific one-shot design

## Player Profile Match

**Best For:** Busy adults, TTRPG newcomers, convention/event play, rotating groups, thematic exploration
**Works Less Well For:** Long campaign seekers, mechanics-focused players, min-maxers, open-world explorers
**Cognitive Load:** Low to Moderate (3-7 elements - simple mechanics, limited options, GM handles complexity)

## Temporal Structure

**Architecture Type:** Three-Act Narrative Structure

* **Act 1:** 45-60min (setup, character creation, premise, initial decisions)
* **Act 2:** 90-120min (complications, escalation, multiple decision points, information reveals)
* **Act 3:** 45-60min (resolution, final confrontation, denouement)
* **Epilogue:** 15-30min (debrief, process themes, safety check-in)
  **Pacing:** Must complete in 3-5 hours, GM controls pacing, flexible structure adapts to player speed.

## Common Mechanics

1. **Simple Resolution System:** Easy to learn (2d6+mod, dice pools, etc.), handles most situations with one mechanic
2. **Minimal Character Complexity:** Pre-gens OR quick creation (5-10 min) OR playbooks/archetypes
3. **Structured Improvisation:** GM has scenarios, flexible responses, branching but converging paths
4. **Dramatic Pacing Tools:** Scene framing, flashbacks, montages, clocks/counters
5. **Safety Tools:** X-Card, Lines & Veils, check-ins (essential for serious themes)

## Resource Patterns

**Primary (Light):** Narrative currency (tokens to influence story), Character resources minimal (health, abilities), Time (implicit - session must end)
**Meta:** Dramatic tension (GM-tracked escalation), Information (revelation pacing)
Resources support narrative, not focus of gameplay.

## Content Needs

**Minimum GM Prep:** 1-page premise, 8-12 decision scenarios, 3-5 revelations, 5-10 NPCs, 1 final confrontation, optional pre-gens, safety tools
**Sustainable:** 2-3 page scenario, 12-15 scenarios with variations, detailed NPCs, maps/visual aids, handouts, 4-6 deep pre-gens
**Formula:** Decision points = (Session hours × 60) / 12min average = \~20 points. Prepare 12 core + 4-6 backup = 16-18 situations.

## Platform Considerations

**In-Person Traditional:** Face-to-face connection, physical props, body language, group energy
**Online Growing:** Virtual tabletop (Roll20, Foundry), video chat, digital tools, accessible across distances
**Requirements:** Session 0 (expectations, safety), reliable 3-5 hour block, comfortable space/good audio

## Monetization Patterns

**Published One-Shots:** Sell as PDF ($5-20), print-on-demand, bundle with rules, subscription services
**Convention Play:** Free to participants, builds community
**Commissioned:** Bespoke one-shots for groups ($50-200), corporate team-building, special occasions

## Social Features

**Core Social:** 3-6 players + GM (optimal 4-5), collaborative storytelling, shared decisions, group bonding
**Between Sessions:** Rotating one-shots with different GM/system, shared library, group chat

## Success Metrics

1. Completion rate: 80%+ finished in time
2. GM satisfaction: Easy to run, clear instructions
3. Player satisfaction: Memorable moments, would replay
4. Replayability: Different groups have different experiences
5. Pacing: Finished in time window (not rushed/dragging)
6. Engagement: All players participated
7. Safety: Everyone comfortable throughout

## Common Variations

* **Investigation:** Mystery solving, clue gathering (Gumshoe)
* **Action:** Heist, combat mission (Forged in the Dark)
* **Horror:** Survive or confront horror (Dread, Ten Candles)
* **Emotional:** Explore relationships/feelings (For the Queen)
* **Comedy:** Absurd situations, improv humor (Honey Heist)

## Design Pitfalls

1. Over-preparation (can't use 50 pages in 4 hours)
2. Under-preparation (no backup for player creativity)
3. Railroad (choices don't matter)
4. Too open (players lost, doesn't conclude)
5. Complex mechanics (bogs down narrative)
6. Too many NPCs (can't give each personality)
7. Slow start (boring first hour loses engagement)
8. Poor pacing (rushed ending or dragging middle)
9. Ignoring safety (serious themes without tools = harm)
10. No debrief (players leave confused or unprocessed)

## Example One-Shots

* The Quiet Year (map-drawing, community, impending doom)
* Dread (horror using Jenga tower for tension)
* For the Queen (card-driven character exploration)
* Honey Heist (comedy heist with bear criminals)
* Lady Blackbird (steampunk adventure, pre-gens)
* Ten Candles (tragic horror, diminishing light)
* Published one-shots for Call of Cthulhu, Monster of the Week, Fiasco

## When This Archetype Fails

* Players want ongoing character development (need campaign)
* Mechanics-focused players (need crunch, not narrative)
* Groups can't commit 3-5 hours in one block
* GM unprepared for improvisation
* Theme/content makes players uncomfortable (safety ignored)
* Scope too large (plot can't conclude in time)
* Too much combat (tactical play slows narrative)
* Complex character creation (eats session time)
* Players expect sandbox exploration (structure too tight)
