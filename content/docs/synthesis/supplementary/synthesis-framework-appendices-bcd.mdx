## Appendix B: Decision Matrices

### Matrix B1: Aesthetic + Player Profile → Architecture

This matrix suggests which scaffold architectures typically work best for different combinations of primary aesthetic and player profile. These are guidelines, not rules—your specific constraints may lead to different choices.

| Primary Aesthetic | Casual Players                                           | Midcore Players                                                | Hardcore Players                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Challenge**     | Compressed Loops (daily puzzles, short challenges)       | Compressed or Full Stack Loops (roguelikes, competitive games) | Full Stack Loops (deep challenge progression)           |
| **Discovery**     | Compressed Loops or Exploration (bite-sized discoveries) | Full Stack or Exploration (sustained discovery arcs)           | Full Stack or Exploration (complex systems to discover) |
| **Mastery**       | Compressed or Puzzle (simple skill ceiling)              | Full Stack Loops (skill progression)                           | Full Stack Loops (high skill ceiling, deep mechanics)   |
| **Completion**    | Compressed Loops (finish in one session)                 | Compressed or Full Stack (episodic or long-form)               | Full Stack (epic completion arcs)                       |
| **Narrative**     | Narrative Arc (short stories)                            | Narrative Arc or Full Stack (story-driven progression)         | Narrative Arc (complex branching)                       |
| **Horror**        | Narrative Arc (focused dread)                            | Narrative Arc (sustained tension)                              | Narrative Arc (psychological depth)                     |
| **Fellowship**    | Varies by social structure—see Matrix B2                 |                                                                |                                                         |
| **Expression**    | Compressed (simple creation tools)                       | Full Stack (elaborate creation)                                | Full Stack or Sandbox (complex systems)                 |
| **Competition**   | Compressed Loops (quick matches)                         | Compressed or Full Stack (ranked play)                         | Full Stack (competitive seasons)                        |
| **Power**         | Inverted or Compressed (quick power gains)               | Full Stack (power progression)                                 | Full Stack (deep progression curves)                    |

**Special Cases:**

**Busy Adult Profile (Casual with complexity tolerance):**

* Challenge: Compressed with depth (chess-like)
* Discovery: Compressed with rich content
* Mastery: Compressed with high skill ceiling
* Key: Session-complete but not simplistic

**Multiple Aesthetics:**

* If primary aesthetics require different architectures, choose architecture for primary aesthetic
* Use secondary aesthetics to inform content within that architecture
* Example: Challenge (primary) + Discovery (secondary) → Compressed Loops with variety

| **Sync Competitive**  | Compressed Loops (matches), Full Stack (seasons) | Must handle skill gaps, matchmaking      |
| **Drop-in/Drop-out**  | Compressed Loops only                            | Missing players can't break experience   |
| **Persistent World**  | Full Stack Loops, Exploration                    | Supports different play schedules        |

| **PC**         | Complex inputs, real-time, many systems, mod support           | Touch-only, motion controls                                          | Alt-tabbing common, streaming expected                              |
| **Console**    | Controller inputs, local multiplayer, real-time action         | Mouse-precise actions, many hotkeys                                  | TV/couch distance, shared device                                    |
| **Board Game** | Physical manipulation, social reading, simultaneous action     | Real-time timing, hidden information at scale, complex math          | Setup time matters, component count limited                         |
| **TTRPG**      | Infinite flexibility, moral complexity, improvisation          | Precise balance, complex math, perfect information tracking          | GM is system, social dynamics primary                               |
| **VR**         | Spatial interaction, embodiment, 3D movement                   | Long sessions, complex UI, reading text                              | Motion sickness, physical space, fatigue                            |
| **Browser**    | Quick load, no install, simple controls                        | Large downloads, complex graphics, persistent state                  | Work/school context common, tab-switching likely                    |

### Matrix B4: Architecture + Aesthetic → Content Needs

| Architecture         | Discovery-Heavy                                          | Mastery-Heavy                                                          | Challenge-Heavy                              | Narrative-Heavy                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Stack Loops** | High variety across all scales (100+ unique elements)    | Moderate variety with depth (20-50 core challenges, scaled difficulty) | Balanced variety (40-80 distinct challenges) | High authored content (hours of story)             |
| **Compressed Loops** | Moderate variety (30-100 elements for replayability)     | Low variety with refinement (10-30 core challenges)                    | Moderate variety (20-60 challenges)          | Low to moderate (episodic stories)                 |
| **Inverted Loops**   | Low variety with numerical progression (5-20 milestones) | Minimal variety (optimization is content)                              | Not typical pairing                          | Minimal (story through numbers)                    |
| **Narrative Arc**    | Moderate branches (12-24 scenarios)                      | Not typical pairing                                                    | Light variety (6-12 challenges)              | High authored content (complete story)             |
| **Puzzle**           | High puzzle count (50-365 unique puzzles)                | Moderate puzzles with difficulty tiers (30-100)                        | Moderate puzzle count (30-90)                | Not typical pairing                                |
| **Exploration**      | Very high spatial content (hours of explorable space)    | Moderate content with mastery gates                                    | Moderate content with challenge gates        | High authored content (environmental storytelling) |

**Reading this matrix:**

* Numbers represent unique content pieces needed for launch
* Add 20-30% for post-launch if live service
* Procedural generation can reduce authored content needs (see Appendix C)

### Matrix B5: Aesthetic → Resource Type Requirements

| Aesthetic      | Required Resource Types                                       | Optional Resources                   | Avoid                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Challenge**  | Limiters (create tension), Trackers (show progress)           | Currencies (enable choices)          | Too many meta-resources (distract from core challenge)     |
| **Discovery**  | Trackers (what's discovered), Currencies (unlock discoveries) | Limiters (gate discoveries)          | Resources that force repetition                            |
| **Mastery**    | Trackers (skill progress), Currencies (advancement)           | Limiters (challenge gates)           | Random-heavy resources (undermine skill)                   |
| **Horror**     | Limiters (vulnerability), Trackers (consequences)             | None                                 | Power resources (undermine horror)                         |
| **Fellowship** | Shared resources, Communication channels                      | Trackers (group progress)            | Competitive scarce resources (unless competition intended) |
| **Expression** | Currencies (creation), Trackers (creations made)              | Limiters (creation costs)            | Strict limiters (constrain expression)                     |
| **Completion** | Trackers (progress visible)                                   | Currencies (unlock completion paths) | Infinite grinds (never complete)                           |

## Appendix C: Content Formulas Reference

### The Base Formula

```
Required Content = (Target Hours × Novelty Rate) / Content Reuse Factor
```

Where:

* **Target Hours:** How long players should be engaged
* **Novelty Rate:** How fast aesthetic consumes fresh content (aesthetic-dependent)
* **Content Reuse Factor:** How many times content can be experienced (architecture-dependent)

### Novelty Rates by Aesthetic

#### Discovery: Highest Novelty Rate (3x baseline)

**Why:** Discovery aesthetic requires encountering new things. Repetition kills Discovery.

**Formula:**

```
Discovery Content = Target Hours × 3 × (1 / Session Length in Hours)

Example: 20 hours target, 0.5 hour sessions
= 20 × 3 × (1 / 0.5)
= 20 × 3 × 2
= 120 unique discovery moments needed
```

**Practical Application:**

* Open-world game: 120 unique locations or secrets
* Metroidvania: 120 rooms/areas (can be smaller with high density)
* Narrative game: 120 story beats or revelations

**Procedural Reduction:**

* With procedural generation: Divide by variation factor (typically 3-5x)
* Example: 120 discoveries ÷ 4 variations = 30 hand-crafted templates

#### Narrative: High Novelty Rate (2.5x baseline)

**Why:** Story beats are consumed linearly and rarely re-experienced the same way.

**Formula:**

```
Story Content (Linear) = Target Hours × Story Density
Story Content (Branching) = Linear Content × Branch Factor

Where Story Density:
- Light narrative: 2-3 beats per hour
- Medium narrative: 4-6 beats per hour  
- Heavy narrative: 8-12 beats per hour

Branch Factor:
- Minimal branching (illusion of choice): 1.2x
- Moderate branching (meaningful choices): 1.8x
- Heavy branching (multiple paths): 2.5-3x
```

**Example (Heavy Narrative with Moderate Branching):**

```
10 hours target × 10 beats per hour × 1.8 branch factor
= 180 story beats needed
```

**One-Shot TTRPG Special Case:**

```
Decision Points = (Session Hours × 60 minutes) / 15 min per point
4 hours × 60 / 15 = 16 decision points maximum
Prepare: 12 scenarios (3 per act) + 4-5 backup improvisation points
```

#### Challenge: Moderate Novelty Rate (1.5x baseline)

**Why:** Challenge aesthetic tolerates repetition (practicing to overcome), but needs variety to prevent solving.

**Formula:**

```
Challenge Content = (Target Hours / Hours per Challenge) × Variety Factor

Where:
- Hours per Challenge: How long to master one challenge (0.5-2 hours typical)
- Variety Factor: Enough to prevent pure memorization (1.5-2x typical)

Example: 20 hours target, 1 hour per challenge mastery
= (20 / 1) × 1.5
= 30 distinct challenges needed
```

**Difficulty Tiers:**

* Divide challenges into tiers: Easy (30%), Medium (40%), Hard (20%), Expert (10%)
* Example: 30 challenges = 9 easy, 12 medium, 6 hard, 3 expert

**Scaling vs. New Content:**

* Pure scaling (same challenge, harder numbers): Reduces content need by 50%
* Example: 15 base challenges, scaled across 2 difficulty modes = 30 challenge experiences

#### Mastery: Low Novelty Rate (0.8x baseline)

**Why:** Mastery aesthetic is about improving at existing content. New content can actually distract from mastery.

**Formula:**

```
Mastery Content = Base Challenges × Depth Factor

Where:
- Base Challenges: Core scenarios to master (5-20 typical)
- Depth Factor: How much depth each has (skill ceiling height)

Rule of Thumb:
- Casual Mastery: 15-30 base challenges (approx 1x baseline)
- Midcore Mastery: 10-20 base challenges with depth (0.8x baseline)
- Hardcore Mastery: 5-15 base challenges with extreme depth (0.5x baseline)

Example: Hardcore fighting game
= 8 characters × 15 matchups each × multiple skill tiers
= 120 matchup scenarios (but only 8+15=23 content pieces to create)
```

**Depth Indicators:**

* Frame-perfect timing (high depth)
* Positional complexity (high depth)
* Optimal strategy discovery (medium depth)
* Execution difficulty (medium depth)

#### Completion: Variable Rate (depends on goals)

**Why:** Completion aesthetic is about finishing things. Content need depends on what "complete" means.

**Formula:**

```
Completion Content = Completion Goals × Steps per Goal

For Collection-Based:
= Collectibles × Locations + Obstacles

Example: Collect 100 items across 20 locations
= 100 items + 20 locations + 10 collection challenges
= 130 content pieces

For Achievement-Based:
= Achievements × Setup Required

Example: 30 achievements × 2 pieces per achievement
= 60 content pieces
```

**Session-Complete Games (Special Case):**

```
Daily Content Needs = Target Active Days

Example: Daily puzzle game, want 90-day retention
= 90 unique puzzles minimum
OR 20 templates × 5 procedural variations = 100 puzzles
```

### Content Reuse Factors by Architecture

#### Full Stack Loops: High Reuse (3-5x)

**Why:** Players encounter same content multiple times across micro/meso/macro loops.

```
Effective Content = Base Content × Reuse Factor (3-5x)

Example: Roguelike with 30 enemy types
= 30 enemies × 4 (seen across multiple runs)
= 120 enemy encounters effective content
```

**Application:**

* Micro loop content: Reused most (5-10x)
* Meso loop content: Moderate reuse (3-5x)
* Macro loop content: Low reuse (1-2x)

#### Compressed Loops: Moderate Reuse (2-3x)

**Why:** Content reused within session, but session completes.

```
Effective Content = Base Content × 2.5 (average)

Example: Daily puzzle game with 60 unique puzzles
= 60 puzzles × 2.5 (players replay favorites, share with friends)
= 150 puzzle experiences
```

#### Narrative Arc: Low Reuse (1-1.2x)

**Why:** Stories are consumed once, rarely replayed.

```
Effective Content ≈ Base Content (no multiplication)

Exception: Branching paths enable replay
= Base Content × (1 + Branch Exploration Rate)

Example: 100 story beats, 40% see alternate path
= 100 × 1.4 = 140 effective beats
```

#### Inverted Loops: Very High Reuse (10-20x)

**Why:** Same systems engaged repeatedly, numerical progression is the content.

```
Effective Content = Minimal Base × Engagement Duration

Example: Idle game with 5 core mechanics
= 5 mechanics experienced thousands of times
= Content is progression curves, not unique pieces
```

### Procedural Generation Efficiency

**When Procedural Generation is Effective:**

```
Procedural Efficiency = Variation Quality × Coherence Maintenance

High Efficiency (4-5x reduction in authored content):
- Puzzle generation (rules-based, clear correct solutions)
- Dungeon layouts (spatial variation, known constraints)
- Loot generation (stat variations, defined boundaries)

Medium Efficiency (2-3x reduction):
- Enemy encounters (behavioral variation, balanced spawns)
- Level themes (visual variation, gameplay constants)
- Quest generation (template-based, Mad Libs style)

Low Efficiency (1.5-2x reduction):
- Narrative generation (coherence difficult)
- Complex spatial design (meaningful layouts hard to generate)
- Precise challenge tuning (difficulty curves need hand-tuning)

Not Recommended (<1.5x):
- Horror content (loses crafted dread)
- Tutorial content (requires precise sequencing)
- Boss encounters (need hand-crafted design)
- Story climaxes (emotional beats need authoring)
```

**Procedural Formula:**

```
Total Effective Content = (Hand-Crafted Templates × Variation Factor) + Hand-Crafted Unique Content

Example: Roguelike enemy design
= (20 enemy templates × 3 procedural variants) + 10 unique bosses
= 60 enemies + 10 bosses
= 70 total enemy types
```

### Special Case: TTRPGs

**GM Preparation Content:**

```
Required Scenarios = (Session Hours × 4) prepared decision points

Why 4x: Need contingencies for player choices, but GM improvises the rest

Example: 4-hour one-shot
= 4 × 4 = 16 decision points maximum
Prepare: 12 core scenarios + 4-5 backup situations
```

**Campaign Content:**

```
Campaign Preparation = Sessions × (4 scenarios per session) × (1 - Improvisation Factor)

Where Improvisation Factor:
- High improvisation GM: 0.6 (40% prepared, 60% improvised)
- Medium improvisation GM: 0.4 (60% prepared, 40% improvised)
- Low improvisation GM: 0.2 (80% prepared, 20% improvised)

Example: 10-session campaign, medium improvisation
= 10 × 4 × (1 - 0.4)
= 10 × 4 × 0.6
= 24 prepared scenarios (GM improvises ~16 more)
```

### Worked Example: Complete Content Calculation

**Scenario: Casual Mobile Puzzle Game**

**Specifications:**

* Primary Aesthetic: Challenge + Completion
* Player Profile: Casual (20-30 min sessions)
* Architecture: Compressed Loops (daily puzzle)
* Target Engagement: 90 days active play

**Step 1: Calculate Base Content Need**

```
Challenge aesthetic: Moderate novelty (1.5x baseline)
Target: 90 days × 1 puzzle per day = 90 base puzzles
Challenge variety factor: 1.5
Total needed: 90 × 1.5 = 135 puzzle experiences
```

**Step 2: Apply Reuse Factor**

```
Compressed loops: 2.5x reuse (players replay favorites)
Required unique puzzles: 135 / 2.5 = 54 unique puzzles minimum
```

**Step 3: Consider Procedural Generation**

```
Puzzle generation efficiency: High (4x) for rule-based puzzles
Hand-crafted templates needed: 54 / 4 = 14 templates
With procedural variation: 14 templates × 4 variants = 56 puzzles
```

**Step 4: Add Buffer**

```
Always add 20% buffer for:
- Playtesting cuts (some puzzles won't work)
- Difficulty curve tuning
- Special event content

Final count: 14 templates × 1.2 = 17 templates needed
OR: 56 unique puzzles × 1.2 = 67 unique puzzles if fully authored
```

**Step 5: Organize by Difficulty**

```
17 templates distributed:
- Tier 1 (Easy): 5 templates
- Tier 2 (Medium): 6 templates
- Tier 3 (Hard): 4 templates
- Tier 4 (Expert): 2 templates

Each template generates 4 procedural variants
= 68 total puzzles (exceeds 90-day target with buffer)
```

**Result:**

* 17 hand-crafted puzzle templates
* Procedural generation system for 4x variation per template
* Organized into 4 difficulty tiers
* Sufficient for 90+ days of daily content
* Budget: 17 puzzle designs + generation system development

## Appendix D: Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall Category: Aesthetic Misalignment

#### D1: "Space Coffee" (Theme Contradicts Mechanics)

**What it is:** When setting/theme implies one experience but mechanics create another. Named after the absurdity of "it's chess, but in space!"—adding space theme doesn't change the chess experience.

**Examples:**

* Horror-themed game with power fantasy mechanics (not scary if you're powerful)
* Stealth game with loud, flashy combat (undermines sneaking)
* Cooperation-focused game with competitive scoring (creates wrong incentives)
* "Zen meditation game" with time pressure mechanics

**Why it happens:**

* Theme chosen before understanding what mechanics create
* Assuming theme automatically creates aesthetic ("horror theme = horror aesthetic")
* Marketing/IP considerations override design coherence

**How to detect:**

* Ask: "If I removed all theme/art, what would mechanics make me feel?"
* If that feeling contradicts your theme, you have space coffee
* Playtest without theme elements—what emerges?

**How to fix:**

* **Option A:** Change theme to match mechanics (easier, faster)
* **Option B:** Change mechanics to match theme (harder, but preserves vision)
* **Option C:** Embrace the contradiction if it's intentional (comedy, parody, subversion)

**Example fix:**

```
Problem: "Cozy farming sim" with harsh failure states and time pressure
Detection: Mechanics create stress, contradicts "cozy"
Fix Option A: Keep mechanics, rebrand as "challenging farm management"
Fix Option B: Remove time pressure, make failure impossible, add "cozy" mechanics
```

#### D2: Mixed Aesthetic Conflict

**What it is:** Combining aesthetics that fight for the same cognitive resources or contradict each other.

**Conflicting Pairs:**

* **Horror + Power Fantasy:** Can't feel vulnerable if powerful
* **Mastery + Randomness (heavy):** Can't master what you can't predict
* **Narrative + Optimization:** Story pacing breaks if players optimize
* **Fellowship + Elimination (competitive):** Hard to feel friendly while eliminating friends
* **Challenge + Accessibility (extreme):** Removing all difficulty removes challenge aesthetic

**Compatible Pairs (by contrast):**

* Challenge + Mastery (mastery IS overcoming challenge)
* Discovery + Wonder (finding creates wonder)
* Horror + Discovery (discovering truth creates horror)
* Fellowship + Challenge (shared challenges bond)
* Narrative + Discovery (story unfolds through discovery)

**How to fix:**

* Choose primary aesthetic, make secondary truly secondary (not equal weight)
* Separate aesthetics by game phase (narrative in cutscenes, challenge in gameplay)
* Accept reduced effectiveness of secondary aesthetic
* Or: Cut one aesthetic entirely

#### D3: Aesthetic Without Support

**What it is:** Claiming an aesthetic but providing no mechanics to create it.

**Examples:**

* "It's a strategy game" but only one viable strategy
* "Meaningful choices" but choices don't affect outcomes
* "Horror game" but no vulnerability mechanics
* "Social game" but no communication tools
* "Mastery game" but no skill ceiling

**How to detect:**

* For each claimed aesthetic, ask: "Which specific mechanics create this?"
* If answer is vague or "the theme," aesthetic is unsupported
* Playtest with aesthetics as success criteria—does it happen?

**How to fix:**

* Add mechanics that directly create the aesthetic
* Or: Remove aesthetic from design goals
* Don't claim aesthetics you don't deliver

***

### Pitfall Category: Structural Problems

#### D4: The Missing Meso Loop

**What it is:** Game has engaging moment-to-moment play (micro loop) and long-term goals (macro loop), but no meaningful medium-term goals (meso loop). Players ask "why am I doing this right now?"

**Why it's deadly:**

* Micro loop alone gets repetitive quickly
* Macro loop alone feels too distant
* Without meso, players have no clear session goal
* Most likely cause of "good mechanics, boring game"

**Examples:**

* Anthem: Fun combat (micro), unlocking gear (macro), but no meaningful 30-minute goals (meso)
* Many live-service games: Daily quests (micro), season rewards (macro), but hollow mid-session goals
* Open-world games: Fun movement (micro), beat the game (macro), but unclear what to do in any session

**How to detect:**

* Play for 30 minutes and ask: "What did I just accomplish?"
* If answer is "nothing meaningful," meso loop is missing or weak
* Look for players who say "it's fun but I don't know what I'm working toward"

**How to fix:**

* Design clear 10-30 minute goals (complete a mission, solve a puzzle, win a match)
* Ensure micro loop success contributes to meso loop progress
* Ensure meso loop completion contributes to macro loop progress
* Make meso loop completions feel significant (rewards, celebration, story beats)

**Meso Loop Checklist:**

* [ ] Can players complete a meso loop in one session?
* [ ] Does meso completion feel accomplishing (not just "quest complete")?
* [ ] Does meso progress show macro advancement?
* [ ] Can players see their meso goal from micro actions?

#### D5: Dominant Strategy (Optimization Kills Challenge)

**What it is:** One strategy is so superior that discovering it trivializes all decisions. Once found, game becomes "execute dominant strategy repeatedly."

**Examples:**

* RPG where one build is 10x more powerful than others
* Strategy game where rushing always wins
* Card game where one deck dominates all matchups
* Resource game where optimal path is obvious

**Why it happens:**

* Insufficient playtesting of optimization
* Underestimating player creativity
* One system scales better than others
* Didn't test long-term play (only early game)

**How to detect:**

* Playtest with optimization-focused players
* Ask: "What's the best strategy?" If everyone agrees, problem exists
* Look at high-level play—if everyone does the same thing, dominant strategy exists
* Check community discussions—players find dominant strategies fast

**How to fix:**

* **Nerf the dominant strategy** (reduce its effectiveness)
* **Buff alternatives** (make other strategies competitive)
* **Rock-paper-scissors balance** (no universal best, context-dependent)
* **Diminishing returns** (best strategy gets worse as you use it)
* **Randomization** (make dominant strategy unreliable)

**When optimization is acceptable:**

* Mastery games where finding optimal strategy IS the content
* Puzzle games with correct solutions (optimization is the point)
* Games where optimization enables style/expression (speedrunning, combo creation)

#### D6: Cognitive Overload

**What it is:** Total cognitive load exceeds player profile capacity. Players can't track everything they need to track.

**Symptoms:**

* Players constantly forget game states
* Tutorial takes 30+ minutes
* Experienced players still make "stupid mistakes" (too much to track)
* Players need external tools (spreadsheets, wikis) to play
* "It's too complicated" feedback

**Common causes:**

* Too many resources (>5-7 for most players)
* Too many mechanics (each adds load)
* Hidden information that must be memorized
* Unclear UI/feedback (adds interpretation load)
* Simultaneous systems requiring attention

**How to detect:**

* Track total trackable elements—compare to player profile budget
* Casual: 3±2 elements max
* Midcore: 5-7 elements
* Hardcore: Can handle more, but still has limits
* Watch playtesters—where do they get confused/forget things?

**How to fix:**

* **Cut systems** (most effective, hardest emotionally)
* **Merge resources** (gold + gems → single currency)
* **Offload tracking to system** (auto-calculate, show clearly)
* **Sequential introduction** (don't teach everything at once)
* **Make systems intuitive** (reduce interpretation load)

**Budget allocation guide:**

* Primary aesthetic mechanic: 40% of cognitive budget
* Goal tracking: 20%
* Resource management: 20%
* Meta-progression: 10%
* Context/theme: 10%

#### D7: Content Drought

**What it is:** Running out of fresh content before players lose interest.

**Discovery-focused games are especially vulnerable:**

* Discovery aesthetic requires novelty
* Content consumed faster than created
* Players hit "seen everything" wall

**How to detect:**

* Calculate content consumption rate (Appendix C formulas)
* Compare to content production timeline
* Look for player complaints: "Not enough content," "Beaten it in X hours"
* Check player retention—sharp drop at content exhaustion point

**How to fix (by phase):**

**Design Phase:**

* Use content formulas to scope properly
* Consider procedural generation early
* Design for content reuse (mastery-focused)
* Reduce aesthetic's novelty needs

**Production Phase:**

* Prioritize content creation
* Cut other features to make content budget
* Use procedural generation where effective
* Plan post-launch content pipeline

**Post-Launch:**

* Add content regularly (live service model)
* Add meta-progression to extend engagement
* Add player-generated content tools
* Accept shorter playtime (not all games need 100+ hours)

### Pitfall Category: Validation Failures

#### D8: Playtesting Wrong Questions

**What it is:** Testing for fun/enjoyment instead of testing whether aesthetics are achieved.

**Wrong questions:**

* "Is it fun?" (too vague)
* "Do you like it?" (subjective, not actionable)
* "Would you play more?" (confounds multiple factors)

**Right questions:**

* "Did you feel \[primary aesthetic]?" (Challenge: clever? Discovery: curious?)
* "When did you feel \[aesthetic] most strongly?"
* "When did you NOT feel \[aesthetic] that you expected to?"
* "What did you think the game was trying to make you feel?"

**How to fix:**

* Design playtest protocols around aesthetic goals
* Use specific questions per aesthetic (from Measurables catalog)
* Watch players, don't just ask (behavior > opinions)
* Test specific mechanics/systems, not "whole game fun"

#### D9: Designing for Ideal Players (Not Real Humans)

**What it is:** Assuming players will engage perfectly with your systems—no interruptions, full attention, optimal mindset.

**Unrealistic assumptions:**

* "Players will read the tutorial carefully"
* "Players will remember rules from last session"
* "Players won't try to break the game"
* "Players will appreciate subtle design"
* "Players will explore thoroughly"

**Reality:**

* Players skim tutorials
* Players forget things between sessions
* Players will optimize/exploit if possible
* Players miss 70% of content unless guided
* Players want clear goals, not exploration homework

**How to detect:**

* Playtest with actual target audience (not other designers)
* Watch first-time players (no tutorial coaching)
* Test with interruptions (pause mid-session, return later)
* Test with distracted players (mobile context, for example)

**How to fix:**

* **Design for interruption** if context requires it
* **Aggressive recapping** of goals/state on resume
* **Assume players will optimize** and design around it
* **Make important things obvious** (subtle design is invisible design)
* **Guide exploration** instead of assuming curiosity

#### D10: Scope Creep (Feature Bloat)

**What it is:** Continuously adding features/mechanics without removing anything. Game becomes bloated, unfocused, over-budget.

**How it happens:**

* "Wouldn't it be cool if..." thinking
* Afraid to cut features (sunk cost fallacy)
* Trying to appeal to everyone
* Confusing "more features" with "better game"

**Warning signs:**

* Mechanic count keeps growing
* Each mechanic feels "necessary"
* Can't explain game in one sentence
* Tutorial length keeps increasing
* Team asks "Why are we adding this?"

**How to detect early:**

* Count mechanics—if >5-7 core mechanics, scrutinize
* Map each mechanic to aesthetic goal—does it serve?
* Calculate cognitive load—are you over budget?
* Ask: "If I cut this, would the game break?" If no, cut it.

**How to fix:**

* **Ruthless cutting** based on aesthetic goals
* **Merge similar mechanics** (reduce total count)
* **Make features optional** (don't force engagement)
* **Ship smaller, add later** (MVP approach)

**The cut test:**
"If this feature/mechanic disappeared, would players notice? Would they miss it? Does it serve the primary aesthetic?"

If answers are no, no, no—cut it.

### Pitfall Category: Context Problems

#### D11: Wrong Platform for Design

**What it is:** Designing for constraints that don't match your platform's reality.

**Examples:**

* Complex keyboard controls on mobile (no keyboard)
* Interruption-intolerant game on mobile (constant interruptions)
* Text-heavy game on TV/console (couch distance, low text readability)
* Real-time competitive game on unreliable connections
* Long-session game for commuters (session too long)

**How to detect:**

* Check platform constraints (Appendix B, Matrix B3)
* Playtest in actual platform context (not dev environment)
* Research platform norms (what do successful games do?)

**How to fix:**

* **Adapt design to platform** (simplify controls, shorten sessions, etc.)
* **Change platform** (if design is more important than platform)
* **Accept limitations** (design around what platform can't do)

#### D12: Wrong Monetization for Design

**What it is:** Monetization model contradicts aesthetic goals or player expectations.

**Problematic combinations:**

* **Horror + F2P energy systems** (breaks immersion with "out of screams")
* **Skill-based challenge + pay-to-win** (undermines achievement)
* **Narrative + gacha mechanics** (interrupts story pacing)
* **Premium price + aggressive MTX** (violates player trust)

**How to detect:**

* Ask: "Does monetization undermine aesthetics?"
* Check if monetization creates perverse incentives
* Research similar games' monetization approaches
* Consider player expectations for this aesthetic/genre

**How to fix:**

* **Align monetization with aesthetic:**
  * Challenge games: Cosmetics, convenience (not power)
  * Discovery games: Content DLC, expansions
  * Social games: Social items, customization
  * Narrative games: Premium or episodic
* **Test monetization early** (don't bolt on late)
* **Be ethical** (respect players' time and money)

## Using These Appendices

**Appendix B (Decision Matrices):** Use during Phase 2-3 when choosing architectures and mechanics. These are guidelines based on successful patterns, not rigid rules.

**Appendix C (Content Formulas):** Use during Phase 4 when calculating content needs. Start with formulas, adjust based on your specific constraints and aesthetic goals.

**Appendix D (Common Pitfalls):** Reference during Phase 5 validation or when playtesting reveals problems. Use the quick diagnostic to identify likely issues.

**These appendices are tools, not laws.** Your specific game may have good reasons to deviate from these patterns. The key is understanding WHY you're deviating and what trade-offs you're accepting.
