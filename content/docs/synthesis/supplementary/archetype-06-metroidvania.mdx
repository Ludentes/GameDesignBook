# Archetype 6: Metroidvania

## Overview

Exploration-focused action platformers where abilities unlock access to new areas. Players gradually expand accessible map through combat, platforming, and ability acquisition. Emphasizes spatial navigation, backtracking with new powers, and sense of growing capability. Sessions 1-3 hours, total 10-30 hours.

## Primary Aesthetics

* Discovery (exploring interconnected world, finding secrets)
* Mastery (improving at combat and platforming)
* Power (gaining abilities that open possibilities)
* Challenge (combat and platforming obstacles)

## Player Profile Match

**Best For:** Exploration-focused, completionists, skill-based players, patient (tolerate backtracking)
**Works Less Well For:** Linear story seekers, non-spatial thinkers, impatient, pure action fans
**Cognitive Load:** Moderate (5-8: map knowledge, ability inventory, item locations, enemy patterns, gating knowledge)

## Temporal Structure

**Architecture Type:** Exploration-Based with Full Stack Loops

* **Micro:** 2-5min (navigate room, defeat enemies, collect items)
* **Meso:** 30-90min (explore region, acquire ability, defeat area boss, backtrack)
* **Macro:** 10-30 hours (unlock entire map, collect all upgrades, master abilities, 100% completion)
  **Pacing:** Early linear (teach mechanics), mid game opens up (multiple paths), late game full access.

## Common Mechanics

1. Interconnected Map (continuous world, shortcuts unlock, save points/fast travel)
2. Ability Gating (5-12 major abilities: double-jump, dash, grapple - block progress until acquired)
3. Combat System (attacks, abilities, enemy patterns, boss fights)
4. Progression (health/energy upgrades, new abilities, equipment/charms)
5. Map System (in-game map essential, shows explored/unexplored, completion percentage)

## Resource Patterns

**Primary:** Health (scarce, attrition), Ability Energy (if separate), Currency (moderate)
**Meta:** Abilities (major progression, 5-12), Health/Energy Upgrades (100+ collectibles), Map Knowledge (player skill - most valuable)

## Content Needs

**MVP:** 10-15 regions, 300-500 rooms, 5-8 abilities, 30-50 enemies, 8-15 bosses, 50-100 upgrades, 10-15 hours
**Sustainable:** 15-25 regions, 500-800 rooms, 8-12 abilities, 50-80 enemies, 15-25 bosses, 100-200 upgrades, 25-35 hours 100%
**Formula:** Backtracking multiplies room value (see each 2-5 times with different abilities). 12-20 hours main, 20-35 hours complete.

## Platform Considerations

**Best:** PC/Console (precise controls), Switch (ideal portable+precision)
**Difficult:** Mobile (touch controls suboptimal for precision platforming)
**Tech Needs:** Responsive controls (\<50ms lag), 60fps preferred, fast load times (deaths common), reliable save

## Monetization Patterns

**Premium Standard:** $15-40 one-time, complete experience, DLC expansions (new areas/bosses/abilities), high value (20-35 hours)

## Social Features

**Mostly Solo:** Ghost data, hint systems, speedrun leaderboards, sequence break showcases
**Community:** Map completion sharing, speedrun community (strong), sequence break discoveries, challenge runs

## Success Metrics

1. Completion rate: 30-60% finish main story
2. 100% rate: 10-30% achieve full completion
3. Average playtime: 15-25 hours first playthrough
4. Replay rate: 20-40% replay
5. Backtracking tolerance: Should be willing, not resentful

## Common Variations

* Souls-like Metroidvania (Hollow Knight - difficult combat, death penalties)
* Sequence-Break Focused (Super Metroid - speedrun optimization)
* Story-Focused (Ori series - environmental narrative)
* Open Early (Axiom Verge - less gating, more agency)

## Design Pitfalls

Poor map design (players lost), tedious backtracking (too far without fast travel), unclear gating (don't know what opens what), weak combat (drags exploration), too linear (defeats exploration appeal), too open early (overwhelming), hidden pixel problem (critical item too obscure), bad save spacing (frustration on death)

## Example Games

* Super Metroid (original formula, sequence breaks)
* Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (RPG elements, gothic)
* Hollow Knight (souls difficulty, vast world)
* Ori and the Blind Forest/Will of the Wisps (story, fluid movement)
* Axiom Verge (indie, glitch mechanics)

## When This Archetype Fails

Players hate backtracking, poor spatial reasoning, want constant forward progress, mobile platform, budget can't support large world, team can't design spatial puzzles, players want strong narrative, very casual audience
