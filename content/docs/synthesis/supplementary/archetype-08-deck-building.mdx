# Archetype 8: Deck-Building Game

## Overview

Games where building and refining a deck of cards IS the gameplay. Players draft cards, construct synergistic combinations, and use the deck to overcome challenges. Emphasizes strategic planning, combo discovery, and optimization. Can be roguelike (Slay the Spire) or constructed (Hearthstone). Sessions 20-60 minutes.

## Primary Aesthetics

* Mastery (learning synergies, optimal builds)
* Challenge (overcoming opponents or scenarios)
* Discovery (finding new card combinations)
* Expression (building unique decks)

## Player Profile Match

**Best For:** Strategy enthusiasts, optimization-minded, replayability-focused, moderate sessions
**Works Less Well For:** Action-oriented, narrative-focused, simplicity-seekers, impatient
**Cognitive Load:** Moderate to High (7-12: card effects 10-100+ cards, mana curve, opponent threats, combo identification, deck composition)

## Temporal Structure

**For Roguelike:** Micro 2-5min (combat, card rewards), Meso 30-60min (full run, die or win), Macro 20-50hrs (unlock cards/characters, master archetypes)
**For Constructed:** Micro 5-15min (match), Meso 30-90min (ranked session, adjust deck), Macro weeks-months (build collection, master archetypes, climb ranks)

## Common Mechanics

1. Deck as Resource (cycles, discards shuffle back, size matters, exhaust/remove)
2. Card Economy (energy/mana per turn, hand size limits, draw effects, card costs)
3. Synergies (cards combo together, archetypes, building around synergies core)
4. Deck Construction (start basic, add through drafting/rewards, remove cards to streamline)
5. Resource Management (health, gold/currency, energy/mana)
6. Randomness (draw order, card offerings, encounters balances luck and skill)

## Resource Patterns

**Primary:** Energy/mana (renewable each turn, 3-10), Hand size (limited, draw 5 typical), Health (attrition, death = loss)
**Meta Roguelike:** Gold (moderate), Card removal (scarce), Relics/artifacts (cumulative)
**Meta Constructed:** Card collection (long-term), Crafting materials (create specific cards)

## Content Needs

**Roguelike MVP:** 75-150 cards, 3-5 characters, 20-40 relics, 30-50 enemies, 5-10 bosses, 3-5 Acts
**Roguelike Sustainable:** 200-400 cards, 8-12 characters, 60-100 relics, 60-100 enemies, 15-25 bosses, 5-7 Acts, ascension
**Constructed MVP:** 200-400 initial cards, 5-10 factions, ranked, deck editor
**Constructed Sustainable:** 500-1000+ cards with expansions, 10-15 factions, regular updates
**Formula:** Viable combinations 100-500 but meta narrows to 10-30 competitive.

## Platform Considerations

**Best:** PC (mouse perfect for cards, large screen), Mobile/Tablet (touch works well, portable)
**Workable:** Console (controller less optimal)
**Tech Needs:** Clear visual design, smooth animations, fast matches, collection management UI, reliable online (for constructed)

## Monetization Patterns

**Roguelike Premium:** $15-25 one-time, all content unlockable, cosmetic DLC, 50-200 hour value
**Constructed F2P:** Free, pay for cards (booster packs, crafting), season passes, careful balance (grindy but not impossible)

## Social Features

**Roguelike Minimal:** Leaderboards, daily challenges (same seed), sharing builds
**Constructed Core:** PvP matchmaking, draft modes, tournaments, spectating, friend matches, guilds

## Success Metrics

**Roguelike:** Runs to first win 5-15, replay rate 70-90%, total playtime 50-200hrs, challenge completion 20-40%
**Constructed:** DAU/MAU 0.4-0.6, sessions 1-5 matches/day, collection progress (F2P competitive deck in 2-4 weeks), ranked engagement 40-60%

## Common Variations

* Roguelike Deckbuilder (Slay the Spire, Monster Train - single-player, draft during run)
* Constructed PvP (Hearthstone, Magic Arena - pre-built decks, competitive)
* Autobattler Deckbuilder (fights resolve automatically)
* Hybrid (Inscryption - deckbuilding + other mechanics)

## Design Pitfalls

Too many cards fast (overwhelming), too few cards (shallow), dominant strategies (one deck best), random with no control (unfair), unclear card text (confusion), poor balance (some cards useless/mandatory), grindy collection (F2P impossible), no draft mode (collection barrier)

## Example Games

* Slay the Spire (roguelike, 4 characters, definitive)
* Monster Train (roguelike, multiplane, high synergy)
* Hearthstone (constructed PvP, accessible, massive pool)
* Magic: The Gathering Arena (constructed, deep complexity)
* Inscryption (roguelike hybrid, horror narrative)

## When This Archetype Fails

Players want action (too slow), hate randomness (draw RNG), need quick sessions (\<15min), can't balance 100+ cards, budget can't support constructed systems, narrative priority (deckbuilding undermines pacing), want spatial/movement mechanics
