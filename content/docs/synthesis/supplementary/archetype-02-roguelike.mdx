# Archetype 2: Roguelike

## Overview

Permanent death games with procedural content generation and meta-progression. Players attempt runs through randomized content, dying frequently but gradually unlocking new options and building mastery. The archetype balances harsh failure with meaningful progression and emergent variety.

## Primary Aesthetics

* **Challenge** (difficult, skill-based, failure is common)
* **Mastery** (getting better at systems and strategies)
* **Discovery** (procedural variation creates novelty)
* Optional: **Power** (building strong character before death)

## Player Profile Match

**Best For:**

* **Hardcore players:** Tolerate difficulty and repetition
* **Mastery-seekers:** Enjoy optimization and skill improvement
* **Replay-tolerant:** Don't need new content every run
* **Pattern-learners:** Get satisfaction from understanding systems

**Works Less Well For:**

* **Casual players:** Difficulty and time commitment too high
* **Story-focused players:** Narrative hard to maintain through death loops
* **Completion-focused players:** Never truly "finish," always more to do
* **Frustration-intolerant:** Death is constant and expected

**Cognitive Load:** High (7-12 trackable systems)

* Complex interlocking mechanics
* Build optimization knowledge
* Enemy pattern memorization
* Resource management across scales

## Temporal Structure (Loop Architecture)

**Architecture Type:** Full Stack (micro + meso + macro)

**Micro Loop (30 seconds - 2 minutes):**

* Single encounter or room
* Tactical combat or puzzle
* Immediate resource decisions
* Can result in damage or death

**Meso Loop (20-60 minutes):**

* Complete run attempt
* Die and lose current progress
* See what meta-progression was earned
* Start new run with permanent unlocks

**Macro Loop (20-50 hours):**

* Unlock all content
* Master all strategies
* Complete challenges/achievements
* Reach "true ending" or hardest difficulties

**Critical Pacing:**

* Early runs: 5-15 minutes before death (learning)
* Mid-skill runs: 30-60 minutes (building power)
* Expert runs: 1-2 hours (deep progression)
* Must feel progress even in failure

## When This Archetype Fails

* Players don't tolerate repeated failure
* Sessions too short for meaningful runs (mobile context)
* Complexity budget exceeded (too many systems)
* Core combat/mechanics aren't fun to repeat
* Procedural generation creates unfair situations
* Meta-progression makes early runs boring (know content but lack unlocks)
