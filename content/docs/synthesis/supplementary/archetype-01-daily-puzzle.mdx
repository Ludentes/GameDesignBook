# Archetype 1: Daily Puzzle Game

## Overview

Games designed for single-session completion with daily refresh. Players solve one challenge per day, often competing against friends or global leaderboards. The archetype prioritizes accessibility, ritual, and social sharing over depth or progression.

## Primary Aesthetics

* **Challenge** (skill-based problem solving within clear constraints)
* **Completion** (finish today's puzzle, feel accomplished)
* **Discovery** (light - new puzzle each day provides novelty)
* Optional: **Fellowship** (sharing results, comparing with friends)

## Player Profile Match

**Best For:**

* **Casual players:** 5-30 minute sessions, low cognitive load
* **Busy adults:** Fits between obligations, predictable time commitment
* **Ritual seekers:** Daily habit formation, morning coffee game

**Works Less Well For:**

* **Hardcore players:** Want deeper systems and longer engagement
* **Binge players:** Want to play multiple hours, not gated by daily refresh
* **Progression-focused players:** Minimal power growth frustrates them

**Cognitive Load:** Low (3-5 trackable elements maximum)

* Simple rules that become familiar
* No memory required between days
* Complete mental reset each session

## Temporal Structure (Loop Architecture)

**Architecture Type:** Compressed (micro + meso only, no macro required)

**Micro Loop (1-3 minutes):**

* Attempt one puzzle
* Immediate feedback on actions
* Clear success or failure state
* Can retry if failed (usually unlimited)

**Meso Loop (5-20 minutes):**

* Complete today's puzzle
* Achieve daily goal (win, maintain streak, beat personal best)
* Optional: Share results socially
* Return tomorrow for new content

**Macro Loop (optional, often absent):**

* Streak tracking (consecutive days played)
* Statistical history (win rate, average time)
* Cosmetic unlocks (themes, backgrounds)
* NO gameplay progression required

**Critical Pacing:**

* Must be completable in single sitting
* Difficulty should be consistent (or follow weekly pattern)
* No mid-puzzle save state needed (or auto-save trivial)
* Daily reset creates natural stopping point

## Common Mechanics

**Core Verbs:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Wordle (letter patterns), Connections (category grouping)
* **Spatial Arrangement:** Two Dots (path finding), Sudoku (number placement)
* **Word Formation:** Spelling Bee (letter combinations), Crosswords (definition solving)
* **Logic Deduction:** Logic puzzles (constraint satisfaction), Picross (number clues)

**Typical Mechanical Elements:**

* **Constrained Action Space:** Limited moves, limited time, or limited resources
* **Binary Success:** Clear win/loss state (no partial credit typically)
* **Retry-Friendly:** Failure costs nothing but time
* **No Hidden Information:** All rules and constraints visible
* **Deterministic:** Same puzzle gives same result (no randomness in solving)

**Input Requirements:**

* Simple inputs (tap, swipe, type)
* No timing precision needed (except in timed variants)
* One-handed play possible (important for mobile)
* Pauseable at any moment

## Resource Patterns

**Primary Resources:**

1. **Attempts/Moves (scarce within puzzle):**
   * Limited per puzzle (e.g., 6 guesses in Wordle, 20 swaps in match-3)
   * Creates planning requirement and tension
   * Can be unlimited with time/score penalty instead
   * Recovery: Complete reset each puzzle

2. **Time (optional pressure):**
   * Hard time limit (fail if exceeded), OR
   * Soft time limit (affects score/stars), OR
   * No time pressure (casual approach)
   * If used: 3-10 minutes typical range

3. **Daily Attempts (abundant):**
   * Unlimited retries within the day (most common)
   * OR limited (3-5 attempts per day with wait timer)
   * Recovery: Full refresh at midnight (local time)

**Secondary Resources:**

4. **Hints/Skips (very scarce):**
   * 1-3 per day (renewable)
   * Shows next move or eliminates wrong options
   * Monetization vector (premium currency)
   * Social sharing can earn more

5. **Streak Counter (meta-resource):**
   * Days played consecutively
   * Breaking streak feels bad (retention mechanism)
   * Often displayed socially
   * No gameplay impact (pure psychological)

**Resources to Avoid:**

* Energy systems (contradicts "complete in one sitting")
* Complex resource conversion (exceeds cognitive budget)
* Persistent upgrade systems (creates power creep)

## Content Needs

**Minimum Viable Product:**

* 30 unique puzzles (one month of daily content)
* Difficulty curve over first week (onboarding)
* Can repeat after 30 days if designed well
* Players tolerate repetition after long gaps

**Sustainable Launch:**

* 90-365 puzzles (3 months to 1 year)
* Enough variety that repeats aren't obvious
* Procedural generation if possible (extends runway)
* Clear difficulty tiering

**Content Formula:**

```
Days of Unique Content = Puzzles Created / Puzzles Per Day
Minimum: 30 days (monthly cycle acceptable)
Ideal: 90+ days (quarterly cycle)
Premium: 365+ days (annual cycle)

With Procedural: 20-50 templates × variations = infinite
```

**Content Consumption Rate:**

* 1 puzzle per player per day (hard capped by design)
* Discovery aesthetic satisfied by daily novelty, not volume
* Replayability comes from temporal gating, not systemic depth
* Old puzzles can be archived/replayed for practice

**Procedural vs. Authored:**

**Go Procedural When:**

* Puzzle type has clear generation rules (Sudoku, word searches)
* Can validate solvability algorithmically
* Need long-term content pipeline
* Examples: Sudoku generators, crossword builders

**Go Authored When:**

* Puzzle requires human creativity (Connections categories, clever wordplay)
* Quality threshold is high (every puzzle must be perfect)
* Smaller content needs (30-90 puzzles manageable)
* Examples: Wordle word list (curated), themed crosswords

**Hybrid Approach (Common):**

* Hand-craft templates/patterns
* Procedurally vary parameters
* Algorithmically validate difficulty
* Human QA pass on edge cases

## Platform Considerations

**Best Platforms:**

* **Mobile (Primary):** Fits lifestyle, always available, push notifications for daily reminder
* **Browser (Secondary):** At work/school context, no installation barrier
* **Desktop/Console:** Works but less natural fit for "quick daily ritual"

**Technical Requirements:**

* **Load time \<3 seconds** (players check quickly)
* **Offline capable** (download puzzle once, solve without connection)
* **Minimal data usage** (puzzle is just text/small JSON)
* **Battery efficient** (no heavy graphics/processing)
* **Cross-device sync** (start on phone, finish on desktop)

**Interface Needs:**

* Large touch targets (mobile-first)
* Clear visual hierarchy (goal state obvious)
* Immediate feedback (actions feel responsive)
* Progress indication (how close to solution)
* One-handed operation preferred

## Monetization Patterns

**Free-to-Play (Most Common):**

* Core puzzle always free and unlimited
* Interstitial ads between attempts (if player fails)
* Rewarded video for hints (watch ad = earn hint)
* Premium currency for hints/skips
* Cosmetic unlocks (themes, tile sets, celebrations)
* Remove ads subscription ($3-10/month)

**Premium (Less Common):**

* One-time purchase removes all friction ($1-5)
* All hints/features included
* Must differentiate from free competitors
* Often includes puzzle archives (play old puzzles)

**Hybrid:**

* Free version with ads and limited hints
* Premium unlock for full features
* Additional puzzle packs for sale

**Monetization Anti-Patterns:**

* Energy systems (breaks "complete daily puzzle" promise)
* Pay-to-win (undermines Challenge aesthetic)
* Aggressive ads (breaks calm ritual feeling)
* Required social sharing (annoying)

## Social Features

**Asynchronous Competition (Core):**

* Daily leaderboards (friends or global)
* Same puzzle for everyone (fair comparison)
* Share results without spoiling (Wordle's emoji grid innovation)
* Compare solve times or scores
* Streak comparisons and accountability

**Social Sharing Patterns:**

* Spoiler-free result sharing (emoji, colors, symbols)
* "I got it in X attempts!" (competitive but friendly)
* Challenge friends to beat your time
* Group challenges (office competition, family streaks)

**Community Features (Optional):**

* Discussion boards (after puzzle completion)
* User-generated puzzles (if system supports)
* Tournament modes (weekend special puzzles)
* Collaborative streaks (team achievements)

**What to Avoid:**

* Synchronous multiplayer (contradicts solo puzzle-solving)
* Spoiler-prone sharing (ruins puzzle for others)
* Required social features (alienates solo players)
* Toxic competition (negative comparisons)

## Success Metrics

**Core KPIs:**

1. **Daily Active Users (DAU) - Primary Metric:**
   * Most important for daily games
   * Target: Grow or maintain
   * Industry benchmark: 40-60% of installs become daily players

2. **Completion Rate:**
   * Percentage who complete daily puzzle
   * Target: 70-90% for casual, 50-70% for harder games
   * Too high = too easy, too low = too frustrating

3. **Streak Length:**
   * Average days played consecutively
   * 3+ days = habit forming
   * 7+ days = strong retention
   * 30+ days = core audience

4. **Next-Day Return Rate:**
   * Percentage who return tomorrow
   * Target: 60%+ is strong
   * First week: 70-80%
   * First month: 50-60%

**Secondary Metrics:**

5. **Time to Complete:**
   * Tracks difficulty appropriateness
   * Should match target player profile
   * Outliers indicate problems (too easy/hard)

6. **Hint Usage Rate:**
   * High usage = puzzles too hard or unclear
   * No usage = hints not discoverable or needed
   * Target: 10-30% of players use hints

7. **Social Share Rate:**
   * Percentage who share results
   * Organic growth indicator
   * Target: 20-40% for successful games

8. **Monetization Metrics:**
   * ARPDAU (average revenue per daily active user)
   * Ad revenue vs. IAP revenue split
   * Subscription conversion and retention

## Common Variations

**Competitive Variant:**

* Timed mode with leaderboards
* Rewards both speed AND accuracy
* Appeals to midcore players
* Example: Mini Crossword has casual and competitive modes

**Narrative Variant:**

* Puzzles unlock story snippets
* Adds Discovery aesthetic to Challenge
* Requires more content investment (story writing)
* Example: Murder mystery daily puzzles

**Collection Variant:**

* Completing puzzles unlocks collectibles
* Meta-game of completion/collection
* Extends engagement beyond pure puzzle-solving
* Example: Two Dots' treasure collection

**Streak Reward Variant:**

* Daily login bonuses
* Increasing rewards for longer streaks
* Risk: Feels manipulative if heavy-handed
* Use sparingly to avoid obligation feeling

**Weekly Challenge Variant:**

* Standard daily puzzles + harder weekend puzzle
* Ramps difficulty across week
* Monday = easiest, Saturday = hardest
* Accommodates different skill levels

**Archive Variant:**

* Play any previous day's puzzle
* Practice mode or completionist feature
* Often premium feature
* Good for new players catching up

## Design Pitfalls to Avoid

**Difficulty Pitfalls:**

**Too Hard:**

* Completion rate \<50% → players quit
* Must balance challenge with accessibility
* Provide hint system as safety net
* Consider difficulty tiers (easy/medium/hard mode)

**Too Easy:**

* Completion rate >95% → no satisfaction
* Challenge aesthetic not satisfied
* Players finish in 30 seconds, want more
* Need variance or progressive difficulty

**Inconsistent Difficulty:**

* Random spikes frustrate ritual players
* Monday hardest puzzle → players never return that day
* Prefer: Consistent difficulty OR predictable ramping (easy Monday → hard Saturday)

**Poor Difficulty Signaling:**

* Players don't know if puzzle is supposed to be easy or hard
* Causes confusion and frustration
* Solution: Difficulty indicators or tiered options

**Content Pitfalls:**

**Insufficient Variety:**

* Patterns become obvious after 10 puzzles
* Players solve mechanically, not thoughtfully
* Discovery aesthetic fails
* Solution: More templates or better procedural variation

**Overwhelming Volume:**

* "500 puzzles available" feels like homework
* Daily gate exists for a reason
* Don't let players binge then burn out
* Exception: Archive for practice is okay

**Poor Procedural Quality:**

* Generated puzzles feel random or unfair
* Unsolvable puzzles ship to players
* Solution: Heavy validation, human QA pass

**Pacing Pitfalls:**

**Too Long:**

* Sessions >30 minutes break casual promise
* Players start but can't finish
* Leads to frustration and abandonment
* Solution: Make puzzles smaller or provide save states

**Too Short:**

* Sessions \<3 minutes feel insubstantial
* Players want more, gating frustrates
* Solution: Add optional bonus challenges or variants

**Bad Save States:**

* Can't resume mid-puzzle after interruption
* Mobile context demands instant pause/resume
* Solution: Auto-save every action

**Monetization Pitfalls:**

**Too Aggressive:**

* Ads after every action
* Constant IAP prompts
* Breaks calm ritual feeling
* Players flee to competitors

**Pay-to-Win:**

* Premium hints too powerful
* Free players can't compete
* Undermines Challenge aesthetic
* Breeds resentment

**Forced Social:**

* Can't progress without sharing/inviting friends
* Ruins solo puzzle-solving aesthetic
* Players resist manipulation
* Keep social features optional

## Example Games

**Pure Daily Puzzle:**

* **Wordle** - Word guessing, 6 attempts, viral sharing mechanic
* **Connections** - Category grouping, clear difficulty
* **Mini Crossword** - Crossword solving, timed leaderboards
* **Spelling Bee** - Word formation, target score system

**Puzzle with Meta-Progression:**

* **Two Dots** - Dot connecting, level progression + daily challenges
* **Nonogram/Picross** - Logic puzzles, picture rewards

**Narrative Integration:**

* **Murder Mystery Daily Puzzles** - Story unlocks with completion
* **Detective Case Files** - Episodic story with daily clues

**Competitive Focus:**

* **Letterpress** - Asynchronous word game, turn-based competition
* **Trivia Crack** - Daily quiz with leaderboards

## When This Archetype Fails

**Wrong Player Profile:**

* **Hardcore players** want more depth, progression, and control
* **Very casual players** may not return daily (unpredictable schedules)
* **Binge players** frustrated by daily gating
* **Competitive players** want real-time competition, not async leaderboards

**Wrong Aesthetic Goals:**

* **Power Fantasy:** No progression to become stronger
* **Deep Narrative:** Limited story capacity in brief daily sessions
* **Mastery:** Resets daily, can't improve at same challenge (unless archive available)
* **Immersion:** Too brief for deep absorption
* **Horror:** Hard to sustain dread in 10-minute daily sessions

**Wrong Context:**

* **Unpredictable Schedules:** Daily commitment impossible (busy parents, shift workers)
* **Poor Internet:** Daily download required, offline not viable
* **No Push Notifications:** Players forget to return
* **Saturated Market:** Already playing 2-3 daily puzzle games

**Wrong Implementation:**

* **Technical Issues:** Load times >10 seconds kill the ritual
* **Unclear Rules:** Players can't figure out what to do
* **Bad Difficulty Curve:** Too hard too fast, or too easy throughout
* **Poor Feedback:** Players don't understand why they failed
* **Aggressive Monetization:** Breaks calm, ritual feeling

**Signs You Should Choose Different Archetype:**

* Players want to play for hours (choose Full Stack loops)
* Daily return is unrealistic for audience (choose on-demand content)
* Core mechanic requires long learning curve (choose progression-based)
* Story is central to experience (choose narrative arc)
* You can't create 30+ puzzles (choose replayable content)
