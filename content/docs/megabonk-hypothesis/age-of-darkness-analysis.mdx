# Age of Darkness: Final Stand - Proof or Disproof of Missing Aesthetics Theory?

## Quick Context

**Age of Darkness: Final Stand**

* Early Access: October 2021
* Full Release: January 15, 2025
* Developer: PlaySide Studios
* Genre: Wave-survival RTS with medieval fantasy setting
* Position: Direct competitor to They Are Billions

The critical question: Does Age of Darkness prove or disprove the "missing aesthetics" hypothesis that explains Megabonk and They Are Billions' success?

## Part 1: What Age of Darkness Is

### The Positioning

Age of Darkness is intentionally positioned as **"They Are Billions but with medieval fantasy setting and more RPG elements."**

**The Formula:**

* Wave-based survival (like They Are Billions)
* Build settlement, survive escalating enemy waves
* Economy management + defense building
* Hero units (added layer of complexity)
* Procedurally generated maps
* Multiple factions/difficulty levels

**Technical Achievements:**

* SwarmTech rendering 70,000+ enemies on screen
* Better graphics than They Are Billions (modern vs retro)
* More unit variety
* Random "malices" (debuffs) each wave for variety
* Skill trees for units

### The Critical Observation

**Age of Darkness spent 3+ years in Early Access (Oct 2021 - Jan 2025) with moderate success.**

Despite being objectively superior to They Are Billions in many technical ways, it never achieved comparable cultural impact or player base.

## Part 2: The Evidence - Does It Support or Contradict Missing Aesthetics Theory?

### Evidence Supporting the Theory (Proves It Works)

**Scenario:** Someone identified that They Are Billions dominated one market segment (slow-burn RTS mastery) and there was room for another configuration in the same space.

**Age of Darkness' attempted configuration:**

* Same core aesthetic (slow-burn mastery)
* Added refinements (better graphics, more factions, hero RPG elements, skill trees)
* Fantasy setting (vs Steampunk)
* More mechanical depth (vs They Are Billions' simpler economy)

**Result:** Moderate success, loyal player base, sustainable project.

**Interpretation:** This SUPPORTS the theory. They identified an underserved variant of the "slow-burn mastery" aesthetic and provided it. The market accepted it.

### Evidence Contradicting the Theory (Disproves It)

**The Real Observation:** Age of Darkness is objectively better than They Are Billions in nearly every measurable way:

* Better graphics
* More complex unit trees
* Hero RPG layer
* Better faction differentiation
* More enemy variety
* Smoother performance
* Modern polish

**Yet reviews consistently say:** "Just play They Are Billions instead. It's better."

**Why would they prefer the inferior game?**

Multiple sources cite the same reason: **They Are Billions has "nostalgic charm" and "timeless feel." Age of Darkness lacks this.**

One review states explicitly: "While Age of Darkness is objectively better from a technical standpoint, the game lacks a certain charm that reeked from its inspiration. I'm talking about the nostalgic look and feel of They Are Billions that gave it a timeless feel."

Another: "Having each faction play almost exactly the same leads to some disappointment from fans...despite having different factions, every playthrough simply feels monotonous."

**This is DAMNING for the missing aesthetics theory because:**

Age of Darkness identified a gap (refined slow-burn RTS with more options), added what was missing (better graphics, more complexity, faction variety), but **failed because it violated the original aesthetic.**

They Are Billions' success wasn't just about "slow-burn mastery." It was about **slow-burn mastery in a specific retro, timeless aesthetic.**

Adding better graphics and complexity didn't fill a missing aesthetic. It **corrupted the aesthetic that made They Are Billions work.**

## Part 3: What This Tells Us About Missing Aesthetics

### The Nuance

Your missing aesthetics hypothesis is **correct in principle but incomplete in practice.**

**It's not enough to identify that an aesthetic is missing.**

You must also understand:

1. **Why it's missing**
2. **What context made it work elsewhere**
3. **Whether adding it violates other aesthetics**

**Age of Darkness' mistake:**

They identified that "slow-burn mastery" was underserved. ✓

They tried to improve it with "technical polish + more complexity + more options." ✓

But they didn't understand that They Are Billions' slow-burn mastery **was inseparable from its retro aesthetic and nostalgic simplicity.**

Adding more complexity and modern polish didn't add missing aesthetics. It **subtracted from the core aesthetic that made the original appealing.**

### Comparison to Successful Missing Aesthetic Additions

**Megabonk ADDED competition to roguelikes AND:**

* Kept the same core loop (30-min auto-shooter runs)
* Added 3D novelty (configuration enhancement, not core change)
* Added absurdist tone (vs gothic, but still distinct personality)
* Leaderboards were infrastructure, not the main draw

**Megabonk did NOT:**

* Streamline the formula
* Remove core mechanics
* Soften the aesthetic

**Age of Darkness tried to ADD:**

* Complexity (vs They Are Billions' simplicity)
* Modern polish (vs retro charm)
* Mechanical depth (vs simple economy)

**This SUBTRACTED:**

* The nostalgic appeal
* The timeless feeling
* The elegant simplicity

## Part 4: Age of Darkness as Market Testing

### What It Actually Reveals

The failure of Age of Darkness (relative to they Are Billions' cultural impact) proves something different than the missing aesthetics theory:

**It proves: Aesthetic coherence matters more than mechanical superiority.**

They Are Billions succeeded because:

* Slow-burn mastery aesthetic ✓
* Retro visual style ✓
* Simple, elegant economy ✓
* Strategic depth emerges from constraints ✓
* Everything aligned toward one experience

Age of Darkness failed to replicate this because:

* Added slow-burn mastery aesthetic ✓
* But changed visual style ✗ (modern vs retro)
* Added complexity ✗ (violated simplicity aesthetic)
* Added more options ✗ (violated elegant constraint aesthetic)
* Created confusion about what experience it was targeting

**The reviews say it explicitly: "What was missing is why Age of Darkness hasn't taken over from They Are Billions—it's trying to be a more complex game in a more detailed world, but that's not what fans want. They want They Are Billions but with more variety."**

Fans wanted **They Are Billions plus competition** or **They Are Billions plus variety**, not **"Theyare Billions but rebuilt from the ground up with modern sensibilities."**

## Part 5: Does This Disprove the Missing Aesthetics Theory?

### The Honest Answer: Partially

**Where the theory STILL HOLDS:**

1. Megabonk proves identifying missing aesthetics works (competition in roguelikes)
2. They Are Billions proves identifying missing aesthetics works (slow-burn mastery in RTS)
3. Market gaps CAN be identified through aesthetic analysis

**Where Age of Darkness CHALLENGES the theory:**

1. Merely identifying a gap isn't enough
2. Adding the missing aesthetic can backfire if it violates the original aesthetic that made the gap valuable
3. Configuration mastery includes knowing WHAT NOT to add

### The Synthesis

The missing aesthetics theory is accurate but needs a critical addition:

**Identifying missing aesthetics works when:**

1. You ADD what's missing without SUBTRACTING what works
2. The new aesthetic enhances rather than complicates the core
3. You maintain aesthetic coherence (everything feels like it belongs together)

**It fails when:**

1. You mistake "complexity" for "missing refinement"
2. You violate the simplicity that made the original work
3. You change too many parameters simultaneously

Age of Darkness changed too many things at once:

* Graphics modernization
* Mechanical complexity
* Faction differentiation
* Unit variety

Any one of these alone might have worked. All together = unintended aesthetic shift that confused positioning.

## Part 6: The Broader Lesson

### What Age of Darkness Really Teaches

Age of Darkness is a perfect example of **Configuration Paradox:**

You can improve a system in every measurable way (graphics, complexity, balance) and make it WORSE.

Because improvement is measured against the wrong criteria.

**The mistake:** They Are Billions succeeded because of slow-burn mastery + retro aesthetic + elegant constraints. Age of Darkness measured success as "better graphics + more options + more complexity."

**The lesson:** Configuration isn't about "more." It's about **coherence toward a specific experience.**

They Are Billions achieved coherence through elegant constraint. Everything pointed toward "desperate survival with limited tools."

Age of Darkness tried to add sophistication, which **incoherently mixed "desperate survivor" (theme) with "sophisticated tactical options" (mechanics).**

These don't belong in the same system.

## Part 7: How This Affects the Framework

### Updating the Missing Aesthetics Model

Age of Darkness suggests we need to add to the framework:

**The process (revised):**

1. **Identify missing aesthetics** in saturated market ✓ (Megabonk, They Are Billions work)
2. **Verify the aesthetic has audience demand** elsewhere ✓ (Proven by those cases)
3. **Add the missing aesthetic WITHOUT violating core identity** ← Critical new step
4. **Maintain configuration coherence** ← Critical new step
5. **Execute with configuration mastery** ✓ (Still true)

**The Age of Darkness lesson:**

* They identified the market gap ✓
* They tried to fill it with improvement ✓
* But improvement violated core identity ✗

### Example: What They SHOULD Have Done

If Age of Darkness wanted to succeed, it could have:

**Option A: Fantasy They Are Billions**

* Keep everything identical to They Are Billions
* Change only visual theme (zombies → undead, steampunk → medieval)
* Add nothing else
* This would work (fantasy reskin of proven formula)

**Option B: Marginal Enhancement They Are Billions**

* Keep core simplicity
* Add ONE refinement (hero units) OR (better faction variety) OR (malice modifiers)
* Keep retro aesthetic intact
* Maintain elegant simplicity
* This would likely work

**Option C (what they did): Wholesale Reconstruction**

* New graphics
* More complexity
* More options
* More factions
* More unit variety
* Changed aesthetic entirely
* This created incoherence

## Part 8: Conclusion - Proof or Disproof?

### Age of Darkness Proves AND Disproves Aspects

**PROVES the theory:**

* Missing aesthetics CAN be identified through market analysis
* Games CAN be configured to fill specific aesthetic gaps
* The approach works (moderate success despite being second-to-market)

**DISPROVES or complicates the theory:**

* Mechanical improvement alone doesn't guarantee success
* Adding missing aesthetics can backfire if it violates the original aesthetic
* Coherence matters as much as gap-filling
* Sometimes "more options" is actually LESS appealing than "elegant constraint"

### The Real Insight

Age of Darkness teaches a crucial lesson: **Configuration mastery includes knowing what NOT to add.**

The missing aesthetics theory works, but it's not about adding anything you want. It's about:

1. Identifying what the market genuinely lacks
2. Adding it in a way that preserves what made the original work
3. Maintaining aesthetic coherence

They Are Billions works because it was austere and constrained.

Age of Darkness tried to make it sophisticated and expansive.

Players didn't want sophisticated They Are Billions. They wanted They Are Billions + competition or They Are Billions + fantasy setting, not They Are Billions + everything we can think of to add.

### Final Verdict

**Age of Darkness PARTIALLY PROVES and PARTIALLY DISPROVES the missing aesthetics theory:**

**Proves:** Market gaps exist and can be identified through aesthetic analysis. Configuration to fill gaps works.

**Disproves:** Simply improving a game doesn't fill a gap if the improvement violates the core aesthetic. Configuration coherence is critical.

**Adds crucial nuance:** Missing aesthetics strategy requires understanding not just WHAT works in the market, but WHY it works, and what configuration changes maintain or violate that core appeal.

Age of Darkness is successful enough to prove the principle, but unsuccessful enough (relative to They Are Billions and Megabonk) to prove that execution matters enormously.

The framework is correct. But it needs refinement:

**Configuration serves specific audiences through specific aesthetics.**

**Add what's missing correctly, maintain what works, and you succeed.**

**Add what's missing the wrong way, or add things that violate core identity, and you fail—even if you're technically superior.**
