# Your Thesis Topic and Next Steps

## The Preliminary Topic

**"Designing LLM-Mediated Game Systems: Purpose-Preserving Adaptation in Interactive Environments"**

This is your preliminary thesis topic. It will almost certainly evolve as you do research - that's normal and expected. This document explains what it means and what you should do next.

## What This Topic Means

### In Academic Language

You're researching how to design systems where LLMs mediate complex interactions while maintaining specific experiential or pedagogical goals. Using tabletop RPGs as a primary case study (because they combine complex rules, natural language, improvisation, and social dynamics), with applications to video games, educational systems, and interactive narratives broadly.

### In Plain English

You're figuring out: How do we build systems where LLMs handle complex game interactions, while making sure the experience achieves what it's supposed to achieve?

Using TTRPGs as your main test case, but showing the lessons apply more broadly.

### The Core Insight

This is about avoiding "space coffee" - understanding WHAT you're trying to create before adding LLM capabilities. Not "infinite random content" but "infinite content that serves a purpose."

## Why This Framing?

### The Strategic Reality

**You care about TTRPGs.** Your advisor cares about TTRPGs. Great - passion drives research.

**But:** Your thesis committee probably doesn't care about TTRPGs specifically. They need to see:

1. Technical challenges worth solving
2. Applications beyond one niche domain
3. Contributions that transfer to other problems

### The Defense Strategy

**Don't present as:** "I'm building AI tools for D\&D"

* Committee thinks: small market, niche hobby, not interesting

**Do present as:** "I'm researching LLM-mediated interactive systems using TTRPGs as an ideal testbed, with applications to games, education, and adaptive systems"

* Committee thinks: interesting technical problems, transferable insights

**TTRPGs become your laboratory, not your entire thesis.**

### Why TTRPGs Are Actually a Good Testbed

When someone asks "Why TTRPGs instead of video games?":

**Answer:** "TTRPGs combine challenges that make them ideal for studying this problem space:

* Complex rule systems (consistency testing)
* Natural language interaction (LLM strength)
* Improvisation (can't pre-program everything)
* Long-term state (memory and continuity)
* Social dynamics (multi-user emergent behavior)
* Clear goals (easy to evaluate success)

Video games have some of these but not all. TTRPGs let me study the full problem, then lessons transfer."

## How This Generalizes (Why Committee Should Care)

### Your Contribution Isn't Just Implementation

You're not just building "a D\&D chatbot."

**You're developing:**

1. **Design patterns** - When to use LLMs vs traditional systems
2. **Architectures** - How to structure LLM-mediated systems
3. **Evaluation frameworks** - How to measure if system achieves its purpose
4. **Comparative analysis** - How different mediums solve similar problems

These contributions transfer.

### Applications Beyond TTRPGs

**What you learn from TTRPG scenarios applies to:**

**Video games:**

* AI-driven NPCs with complex behavior
* Adaptive difficulty and pacing
* Procedural narratives that maintain quality

**Education:**

* Adaptive tutoring systems
* Interactive learning scenarios
* Exploratory simulations

**Training:**

* Medical simulations
* Corporate training scenarios
* Soft skills practice

**Interactive narrative:**

* Adaptive storytelling
* Branching narratives with coherence
* User-driven exploration

### How Scenarios Demonstrate This

Each scenario you study should:

1. **TTRPG implementation** (your depth and focus)
2. **Video game comparison** (shows generalization)
3. **Technical challenges** (what's hard and why)
4. **Transferable insights** (what applies broadly)

Example: "Alien Cognition" scenario

* **TTRPG:** GM describes world through alien perception, maintains consistency
* **Video game:** NPCs with genuinely different behavior patterns, visual representation of altered perception
* **Challenge (both):** Simulating and maintaining consistent non-human cognitive models
* **Transfers to:** Educational perspective-taking, accessibility (neurodivergent representation), simulation (modeling different decision-making)

This shows committee you understand both depth (TTRPGs) and breadth (applications).

## What Will Probably Change

**Right now you're committing to:**

* LLMs as core technology
* Interactive systems (games)
* Purpose-preservation as key concept
* TTRPGs as primary case study
* Showing generalization

**You're NOT locked into:**

* Specific scenarios (pick what interests you)
* Number of scenarios (might be 2-3, not 6)
* Implementation details
* Exact evaluation methods
* Final scope

**Expected evolution:**
Your topic will narrow and sharpen as you work. Maybe you'll focus on state management, or evaluation frameworks, or cross-medium design patterns. That's fine - research clarifies as you go.

## What You Need to Do Now

This isn't about planning the whole thesis. It's about understanding enough to make an informed decision about whether this interests you.

### Your immediate goals:

1. **Understand game systems** (why different mechanics for different purposes)
2. **Understand the scenarios** (what problems are we solving)
3. **Write 1-2 scenarios of your own** (what interests YOU)
4. **Decide if this direction excites you**

Then we can talk specifics.

See the companion document "Getting Started: What to Read and Do" for concrete next steps.

## The Meta-Point

You'll be doing research you care about (TTRPGs). But you're framing it so people who don't share that passion understand its value.

**This isn't dishonest.** The technical challenges are real. The applications are real. The contributions are real.

The framing just helps you communicate that effectively.

Do research that excites you. Frame it so others see why it matters. That's the game.
