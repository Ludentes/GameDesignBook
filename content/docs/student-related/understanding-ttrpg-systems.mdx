# Understanding TTRPG Systems: Why Mechanics Matter

## The Problem You Don't Know You Have

If D\&D is the only tabletop RPG system you know, you probably think "RPG system" means:

* Roll d20 + modifier to see if you succeed
* Track HP, AC, and spell slots
* Combat has detailed turn-by-turn rules
* Everything else is "just roleplay"

**Here's the insight you're missing:** D\&D is designed for ONE specific type of experience (tactical fantasy combat with powerful heroes), and its mechanics ONLY support that experience well. When you try to use D\&D for other stories (political intrigue, horror, heists, mysteries), you're fighting against the system.

Different systems are built for different experiences. The mechanics aren't just "how you resolve actions" - they're **what the game thinks is important** and **what kind of story emerges from play**.

This document will show you why this matters, especially when thinking about LLMs and games.

## Why This Matters More Than "AI Character Sheets"

Most people think "AI + TTRPGs" means:

* Generate character portraits with Stable Diffusion
* Auto-fill character sheets
* LLM describes scenes more vividly
* LLM plays NPCs with more personality

**This is "space coffee."** It's just putting "AI" in front of existing things without understanding what you're actually trying to achieve.

**The real opportunity:** LLMs let us build game systems that were IMPOSSIBLE before because they can:

* Maintain complex state and consequences across unlimited interactions
* Adapt to player creativity without breaking internal consistency
* Handle natural language instead of forcing everything into dice rolls
* Support experiential purposes that traditional systems couldn't handle

But to design these systems, you need to understand what makes a good system in the first place. You need to understand why different mechanics create different experiences.

## What D\&D Is Actually Good At

Let's start by understanding D\&D itself.

### What D\&D's Mechanics Tell You About Its Purpose

**Look at a D\&D 5e character sheet:**

* 60% of the space: Combat abilities (attack bonuses, AC, HP, spell damage)
* 20% of the space: Skills (mostly for non-combat situations)
* 20% of the space: Personality/background (bonds, flaws, ideals)

**The message:** Combat is complex and important. Everything else is simple.

**Look at D\&D's core resolution mechanic:**

* Roll d20 + modifier vs Difficulty Class (DC)
* Meet or beat the DC = success
* Below the DC = failure

**What this creates:**

* High variance (the d20 swing is huge - a +5 modifier matters less than luck)
* Uncertainty even for experts (the rogue with +11 to lockpicking can still roll a 1)
* Binary outcomes (you succeed or you don't, nothing in between)

**Look at what D\&D gives detailed rules for:**

* Combat: Initiative, actions, bonus actions, reactions, movement, attacks, saving throws, conditions, cover, advantage/disadvantage
* Magic: Hundreds of spells with specific effects
* Character building: Classes, subclasses, feats, multiclassing

**Look at what D\&D does NOT give rules for:**

* Persuading an NPC (just roll Persuasion, DM decides what happens)
* Political maneuvering (no mechanics at all)
* Investigation and clue-finding (roll Investigation, fail = no clue)
* Moral choices (no mechanical consequences for alignment)
* Relationships (no system for tracking NPC opinions)

### What D\&D Is Designed For

D\&D excels at:

* **Tactical fantasy combat** where positioning and resource management matter
* **Heroic power fantasy** where you play exceptional individuals
* **Party-based adventures** where a group cooperates against external threats
* **Dungeon crawling** where resource depletion creates pressure
* **Monster fighting** where different enemies have different tactical challenges

D\&D struggles with:

* **Political intrigue** (no mechanics to support it)
* **Mystery solving** (you can fail to find critical clues)
* **Realistic consequences** (heroes can take dozens of sword hits)
* **Moral complexity** (no mechanical weight to ethical choices)
* **Social-focused stories** (one skill check vs an entire combat system)

**The key insight:** D\&D's mechanics reveal its true purpose. The system provides mechanical support for what it thinks matters. Everything else is left to "just roleplay it."

## Systems Built for Different Purposes

Let's look at other systems to understand how mechanics shape experience.

### Example 1: Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA)

**Core Innovation:** "Moves" that trigger on fictional actions.

**How it works:**

```
When you [do something specific in the fiction], roll 2d6 + modifier:
- On 10+: You do it successfully
- On 7-9: You do it, but with a cost/complication
- On 6-: You fail, and the GM makes a hard move (something bad happens)
```

**Example move from Apocalypse World:**

```
When you go aggro on someone, roll+Hard.
On 10+: they have to choose: force your hand and suck it up, or cave and do what you want
On 7-9: they can choose to cave, or they can instead force your hand, and you'll have to make good on your threat or back down
On 6-: they call your bluff or turn the tables
```

**What this creates:**

* Something ALWAYS happens (even failure moves the story forward)
* Partial success is common (creates interesting choices)
* Failure isn't "you can't do this" but "something goes wrong"
* The moves encode the genre (different PbtA games have completely different moves)

**Why this matters:**

* In D\&D: Failed Persuasion check = "You don't convince them. Try something else."
* In PbtA: Failed persuasion = "They're convinced, but now they want something from you" or "You convince them, but someone else overhears"

**Different PbtA games have different moves because they create different experiences:**

**Monsterhearts (supernatural teen drama):**

* "Turn Someone On" (create attraction/desire)
* "Lash Out Physically" (violence has social consequences)
* "Run Away" (fleeing is mechanically supported)
* Built for teen supernatural romance/horror

**Dungeon World (fantasy adventure):**

* "Hack and Slash" (deal damage when fighting)
* "Spout Lore" (recall useful information)
* "Defy Danger" (act quickly under pressure)
* Built for D\&D-style adventure but with PbtA's momentum

**The Sprawl (cyberpunk heists):**

* "Research" (gather intel before the job)
* "Mix It Up" (fast-paced action)
* "Play Hardball" (negotiate with leverage)
* Built for cyberpunk mission-based play

**Key Insight:** The mechanics encode the genre. You can't play teen romance with Dungeon World's moves, and you can't play dungeon crawls with Monsterhearts' moves. The system IS the experience.

### Example 2: Blades in the Dark (Heist Stories)

**Core Innovation:** Position & Effect negotiation, Flashbacks, Stress economy

**How it works:**

**Before rolling, negotiate:**

* **Position:** Are you in a Controlled, Risky, or Desperate situation?
* **Effect:** Will success be Limited, Standard, or Great?

Example:

* Player: "I want to pick the lock"
* GM: "You're picking it while guards patrol. That's Risky position. The lock is complex, so Standard effect - you'll get through but it'll take time."
* Player: "What if I use my Wrench as a crowbar instead?"
* GM: "Louder, but faster. Still Risky, but Great effect if you succeed."

**Then roll dice based on your action rating:**

* **Critical (6,6):** You do it, and there's some extra benefit
* **Success (6):** You do it as negotiated
* **Partial (4-5):** You do it, but there's a consequence or complication
* **Failure (1-3):** You don't do it, and there's a consequence

**Flashback mechanic:**

* Instead of planning for hours, you plan DURING the heist
* Player: "Did I bring rope?"
* GM: "That's a flashback. It was obvious you'd need rope - no stress cost. What's the scene of you acquiring it?"
* Or: "Did I bribe the guard beforehand?"
* GM: "That's risky. Pay 2 stress and we'll roll to see if it worked."

**Stress and Consequences:**

* Take Stress to push yourself (extra dice, flashbacks, resisting consequences)
* Fill your Stress track → Trauma (permanent character change)
* Take Harm (physical consequences) or Heat (attract attention)

**What this creates:**

* Heist movie pacing (planning happens in moments, not hours)
* Escalating tension (stress builds, pushing characters to limits)
* Difficult choices (risk more or accept complications?)
* "The job never goes as planned" feel (complications are baked in)

**Why this matters for LLMs:**
Blades shows that you can create specific story structures (heists) through mechanics. An LLM could maintain the Position/Effect negotiation naturally:

* Player describes action
* LLM assesses situation and offers Position/Effect
* Player can negotiate or find creative alternatives
* System maintains heist story structure without forcing predetermined scenes

### Example 3: Dogs in the Vineyard (Moral Exploration)

**Core Innovation:** Escalation mechanics that force you to choose when to use violence.

**Setting:** You play "God's Watchdogs" in a supernatural Western - religious enforcers who travel from town to town dealing with sin and heresy.

**How conflict works:**

When you're in conflict, you:

1. State what you want from the conflict
2. Roll dice based on your traits, relationships, and belongings
3. Take turns:
   * **Raise:** Describe an action and choose dice to match it
   * **See:** Use dice to block their action, or take consequences

**The key mechanic - Escalation:**

* **Just Talking:** Use your base dice pool
* **Physical (pushing, grabbing):** Add more dice
* **Fighting (punches, wrestling):** Add even more dice
* **Gunfighting:** Add the most dice

**What this creates:**

* You get more dice when you escalate to violence
* But escalating has narrative weight (you crossed a line)
* You must constantly choose: "Is this worth resorting to violence?"
* The game mechanically asks: "When do YOU think violence is justified?"

**Example:**

* You're trying to convince a father to let you take his heretic son
* You're losing the argument (running out of dice)
* You can escalate to physical intimidation (get more dice)
* Or escalate to drawing your gun (get lots of dice)
* But then YOU'RE the person who pulled a gun on a grieving father

**Why this matters:**

* D\&D treats combat as a neutral tactical challenge
* Dogs makes violence a moral choice with mechanical weight
* The system explores "what is justified authority?" through play
* You don't discuss ethics in abstract - you face them in decisions

### Example 4: Burning Wheel (Long-term Character Development)

**Core Innovation:** "Let It Ride" rule and Belief-driven advancement.

**Let It Ride:**

* You roll once for an entire situation
* No re-rolling the same thing in the same scene
* One roll can determine days or weeks of activity
* Creates: Novel-like time scale, focus on important moments

**Beliefs, Instincts, Traits:**

* **Beliefs:** Your character's goals/motivations (mechanically enforced)
* **Instincts:** Automatic reactions ("Always draw my sword when threatened")
* **Traits:** Personality/background features that give dice

**Advancement through roleplaying:**

* You earn "Artha" (fate points) by:
  * Playing to your Beliefs (even when it's disadvantageous)
  * Embodying your Traits
  * Following your Instincts
* Your Beliefs can change during play when character growth happens
* Skills advance by using them in challenging situations

**Duel of Wits:**

* Social conflicts get the same mechanical attention as combat
* Structured argument with positioning and strategy
* Losing means you're convinced (mechanically, not just "failed persuasion")

**What this creates:**

* Character-driven stories (you're rewarded for pursuing your character's goals)
* Long-term arcs (beliefs change over time)
* Social conflicts matter (they're not just skill checks)
* Epic fantasy where character development is central

### Example 5: Gumshoe System (Mystery Investigation)

**Core Innovation:** Automatic clue finding.

**How it works:**

* If you have the relevant investigative ability, you find the clue automatically
* No rolling to find core clues (you're competent investigators)
* Rolls are only for actions with uncertain outcomes or costs

**Why this exists:**

* In D\&D: Failed Investigation check = "You don't find the clue"
* In a mystery story: Not finding clues = story stops, players stuck
* Gumshoe: Finding clues is guaranteed, the game is about what you DO with them

**What this creates:**

* Forward momentum in mystery stories
* Focus on interpretation and decision-making, not searching
* Characters feel competent (you're actual detectives, not lucky amateurs)

**Why this matters for game design:**
Different resolution mechanics serve different purposes:

* D\&D's "roll to find clue" works for dungeon crawls (finding secrets is optional)
* Gumshoe's automatic clues work for mysteries (finding clues IS the game)

## The Pattern: Mechanics Shape Experience

Let's map what we've learned:

| System            | Core Experience                 | Key Mechanic                        | What It Does                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **D\&D**          | Tactical combat, heroic fantasy | d20 + mod vs DC                     | High variance, binary outcomes, emphasis on combat |
| **PbtA**          | Genre emulation, momentum       | 2d6 + mod, tiered outcomes          | Always moves forward, encodes genre in moves       |
| **Blades**        | Heist stories                   | Position/Effect, Flashbacks, Stress | Heist pacing, escalating tension, hard choices     |
| **Dogs**          | Moral complexity                | Escalation mechanics                | Violence as choice with mechanical weight          |
| **Burning Wheel** | Character-driven epic fantasy   | Let It Ride, Beliefs                | Novel-like time scale, character growth central    |
| **Gumshoe**       | Mystery investigation           | Automatic clue finding              | Competent investigators, focus on interpretation   |

## What D\&D Can't Do (And What Would Work Instead)

### Game of Thrones Campaign

**Why D\&D fails:**

* Political maneuvering has no mechanical support
* Assumes party cooperation (GoT is about betrayal)
* Combat is too "heroic" (people die from one sword thrust in GoT)
* Magic breaks political realism

**What would work:**

* **Houses of the Blooded** (intrigue mechanics, betrayal is part of the system)
* **Burning Wheel** (Duel of Wits for political debates, social combat)
* **Custom system with LLM** (track faction relationships, political consequences)

### Sherlock Holmes Mystery

**Why D\&D fails:**

* Investigation is a skill check you can fail
* No mechanics for logical deduction
* Combat-focused character sheets (Holmes rarely fights)
* No support for "eureka" moments

**What would work:**

* **Gumshoe** (automatic clue finding, focus on interpretation)
* **Brindlewood Bay** (collaborative mystery solving)
* **Custom system with LLM** (track clue relationships, help players make connections)

### Horror Survival Campaign

**Why D\&D fails:**

* Characters are too powerful (hard to feel threatened)
* Death/injury is easy to heal (no lasting consequences)
* Combat-focused (horror should avoid direct confrontation)
* No mechanics for fear or psychological damage

**What would work:**

* **Call of Cthulhu** (sanity mechanics, fragile characters)
* **Warhammer Fantasy** (deadly combat, corruption mechanics)
* **Ten Candles** (tragic horror with guaranteed doom)

### Heist Campaign

**Why D\&D fails:**

* No planning mechanics (planning in D\&D = hours of strategizing)
* One failed roll can derail entire plan
* No mechanical support for "complications" vs "failure"
* Resource management for dungeons, not for heists

**What would work:**

* **Blades in the Dark** (built specifically for heists)
* **Leverage RPG** (based on the TV show about con artists)

## The Character Sheet Test

**A quick way to understand any system: Look at the character sheet.**

What takes up space reveals what the game thinks matters:

* D\&D: Combat abilities dominate
* Blades: Stress, trauma, crew, and connections get equal space to abilities
* Dogs in the Vineyard: Relationships and belongings are mechanically important
* Burning Wheel: Beliefs and Instincts are front and center

**Exercise:** Find character sheets for the systems mentioned here. Look at what gets mechanical attention. What does each system think is important?

## Why This Matters for LLMs

Now we get to the real question: Why does understanding systems matter when thinking about LLMs and games?

### Bad LLM Game Design (Space Coffee)

**"AI Dungeon Master":**

* Take D\&D
* Replace human DM with LLM
* LLM describes scenes more vividly
* LLM plays NPCs with more personality
* **Result:** Still has all of D\&D's limitations, just with fancier descriptions

**"AI-Generated Content":**

* LLM generates infinite dungeons
* LLM creates random NPCs on demand
* **Result:** Infinite shallow content, no coherent purpose

### Good LLM Game Design (Understanding Purpose)

**Question 1: What can LLMs do that traditional systems couldn't?**

* Maintain complex state across unlimited interactions
* Adapt to player creativity in natural language
* Track nuanced consequences and relationships
* Handle granular simulation without overwhelming players

**Question 2: What constraints can we remove?**

**Traditional TTRPG constraint:** Everything must be resolvable with 1-2 dice rolls

* Human GMs can't track complex subsystems in their head
* Players can't roll dice 100 times per turn
* Example: D\&D combat is "one attack roll" because doing more is tedious

**With LLM:** Could have complex resolution

* A sword fight could consider: skill, fatigue, terrain, morale, injuries, equipment quality
* LLM handles complexity, presents results simply
* But wait - is this better? Or is the drama of "one roll decides" part of the experience?

**Traditional TTRPG constraint:** Limited state tracking

* Human GMs forget details
* Players can't reference every past conversation
* Example: NPCs often forget what players told them 3 sessions ago

**With LLM:** Perfect memory

* Every NPC remembers every interaction
* Consequences ripple naturally
* But: Does perfect consistency remove emergent chaos/humor?

**Traditional TTRPG constraint:** Binary or simple outcomes

* D\&D: You succeed or fail
* PbtA: Success, partial success, or failure
* Keeps resolution fast

**With LLM:** Nuanced outcomes

* "You convince the guard, but he's suspicious now"
* "You pick the lock, but you notice someone watching from a window"
* "You cast the spell successfully, but the local mages' guild senses the magic"
* Natural language allows infinite shades of consequence

### Question 3: What purposes become possible?

**Example: Exploring Social Inequality**

**Traditional system challenges:**

* Hard to systemize privilege/disadvantage without being preachy
* Difficult to maintain consistency across many interactions
* Players might not notice subtle differences in treatment

**LLM-enabled system:**

* System tracks social status, race, gender, wealth for each character
* NPCs react differently based on these factors (naturally, not mechanically)
* Players experience systemic inequality through play
* LLM maintains consistency: the merchant who was respectful to the noble PC is dismissive to the poor PC

**Example: Detective Stories with Real Deduction**

**Traditional system challenges:**

* Hard to present clues that are discoverable but not obvious
* Difficult to track logical connections between clues
* Risk of players getting stuck (failed Investigation roll = no progress)

**LLM-enabled system:**

* Clues presented naturally in descriptions
* LLM tracks what players know and can hint at connections
* Can generate "aha" moments when players make correct logical leaps
* Maintains internal consistency (no contradictory clues)

**Example: Moral Weight of Choices**

**Traditional system challenges:**

* Alignment is often mechanical and simplistic
* Hard to track reputation/consequences across many NPCs
* Players may not see long-term consequences of actions

**LLM-enabled system:**

* Actions have rippling consequences naturally
* NPCs remember and react to past choices
* Moral complexity through narrative, not mechanics
* "You saved the village, but now they depend on you" type consequences

## What You Should Research

Now that you understand why different systems create different experiences, here are questions to explore:

### 1. System Analysis

Pick 2-3 systems beyond D\&D and analyze:

* What experience is this trying to create?
* What gets mechanical attention? (look at character sheets)
* What kinds of failure does this system have?
* How does time/pacing work?
* What would this system be terrible at?

**Suggested systems to compare:**

* **Blades in the Dark** (heists, stress economy, flashbacks)
* **Apocalypse World** (PbtA, genre emulation through moves)
* **Burning Wheel** (belief-driven, long-term character arcs)
* **Dogs in the Vineyard** (escalation, moral choices)
* **Gumshoe** (mystery investigation, automatic clues)

### 2. Purpose-to-Mechanics Mapping

Choose a specific experience you want to create, then:

* What are the key moments in this experience?
* What needs mechanical resolution vs narrative description?
* What kind of failure is interesting for this experience?
* What should the character sheet track?

**Example exercises:**

* Design a system for exploring colonialism and its consequences
* Design a system for romantic comedy stories
* Design a system for time travel paradoxes
* Design a system for building a business/organization

### 3. LLM Opportunities

For your chosen experience:

* What constraints did traditional systems have?
* What becomes possible with an LLM?
* What should you keep from traditional systems? (dice? mechanical structure?)
* How do you test if the experience works?

### 4. The "Space Coffee" Test

Look at existing "AI + TTRPG" projects:

* What are they actually doing?
* Are they just adding "AI" to existing concepts?
* Do they understand what experience they're creating?
* What would make them NOT space coffee?

## Reading and Playing List

### Essential Reading

**Systems to read (available as PDFs/SRDs):**

1. **Apocalypse World** - Read to understand Moves
2. **Blades in the Dark** - Read for Position/Effect and Flashbacks
3. **Dogs in the Vineyard** - Read for Escalation mechanics
4. **Dungeon World** - PbtA take on D\&D (shows contrast)

**Short Articles:**

1. **"System Does Matter" by Ron Edwards** - Classic essay on why system choice matters
2. **"The Impossible Thing Before Breakfast"** - About contradictions in traditional RPG design
3. Any game's "How to Play" or "Principles" section - These reveal design philosophy

### Essential Playing

**You must actually play systems to understand them. Reading isn't enough.**

**Start with:**

* **One-shot of Dungeon World** - Familiar fantasy, but PbtA mechanics
* **One-shot of Blades in the Dark** - Heist, stress, flashbacks
* **Watch actual play** if you can't get a group:
  * Friends at the Table (Blades in the Dark)
  * The Adventure Zone (various systems)
  * Critical Role (they've played different systems)

**The goal:** Experience how different mechanics create different feelings at the table.

### Questions to Ask While Playing

1. **What does the character sheet emphasize?**
2. **When do we roll dice? When do we not?**
3. **What happens when we fail? Does play stop or transform?**
4. **What gets detailed mechanical attention?**
5. **How does this feel different from D\&D?**
6. **What story does this system want to tell?**

## Conclusion: Why This Matters

Understanding TTRPG systems isn't about collecting game knowledge. It's about understanding:

1. **Mechanics shape experience** - The rules aren't neutral, they create specific types of stories
2. **Purpose determines design** - Good systems are built for specific experiences
3. **Constraints force creativity** - Traditional systems had limitations that shaped their design
4. **LLMs change what's possible** - But only if you understand what you're trying to achieve

When you think about "LLMs + TTRPGs," don't think:

* "How can AI make D\&D easier?"
* "How can AI generate more content?"

Instead think:

* "What experiences were impossible before?"
* "What systems can we build when old constraints are removed?"
* "What purposes can games serve with these new tools?"

The difference between good and bad LLM game design is the difference between understanding purpose and just adding "AI" to existing things.

Now go read some systems. Play some games. Come back with questions about what experiences you want to create.

## Discussion Questions for Your Advisor

After exploring some systems:

1. What experience do you find most interesting to create? (Why?)
2. Which system's approach resonated with you? (What clicked?)
3. What limitations of traditional systems seem most worth removing with LLMs?
4. What elements of traditional systems should we keep, even with LLMs?
5. Can you articulate a specific game concept that would be impossible without LLMs? (Not just "better with AI" but actually impossible before)
6. What's one example of "space coffee" thinking you've seen in AI + games? What would make it not space coffee?
