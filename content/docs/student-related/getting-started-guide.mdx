# Getting Started: Your First Steps

## Overview

You have several documents to read. This guide tells you:

1. What to read and in what order
2. What to google first for context
3. What to do in the next few days
4. What to do in the next few weeks

**Goal:** Understand enough to decide if this research direction interests you and to write 1-2 scenarios of your own.

## The Documents You Have

1. **games-as-experiential-scaffolds.md** - Core concept: games as purpose-built experiences
2. **understanding-ttrpg-systems.md** - Why different game systems create different experiences
3. **game-design-scenarios.md** - Six real scenarios showing what problems we're solving
4. **thesis-topic-explanation.md** - Why the topic is framed the way it is

## What to Do in the Next Few Days

### Day 1: Get Basic Context

**Before reading anything, google and read briefly:**

1. **"What is a TTRPG"** or **"How do tabletop RPGs work"**
   * Just get the basics if you're not familiar
   * You need to understand: GM, players, dice, character sheets, campaigns
   * 15-20 minutes

2. **"D\&D 5e vs other RPG systems"** or **"RPG systems comparison"**
   * Understand that D\&D isn't the only system
   * Skim articles comparing different systems
   * 10-15 minutes

3. **"Powered by the Apocalypse"** or **"PbtA games"**
   * This will come up a lot in the documents
   * Just understand the basics: moves, 2d6, tiered outcomes
   * 10 minutes

**Total: \~45 minutes of background research**

**Then read:**

**Document 1: games-as-experiential-scaffolds.md**

* Start here - this explains the core insight
* Time: 45-60 minutes
* Focus on: The examples (inequality, inhabiting stories, ethics, detective)
* Key question: Does the "purpose-built scaffold" idea make sense to you?

**After reading, ask yourself:**

* Do I understand why "space coffee" is bad?
* Can I explain the difference between "what is a game" and "what experience do we want to create"?
* Does this framing interest me?

If you're confused or bored, stop and talk to your advisor. If you're intrigued, continue.

### Day 2: Understand Why Systems Matter

**Document 2: understanding-ttrpg-systems.md**

* This is long - budget 2-3 hours
* You don't need to memorize everything
* Focus on: The pattern (different mechanics create different experiences)

**How to read this:**

1. Read the introduction and "The Problem You Don't Know You Have"
2. Read the D\&D section carefully (understand what it's good at and bad at)
3. Pick TWO of the example systems (Blades in the Dark and one PbtA game) and read those sections carefully
4. Skim the rest - you can come back later
5. Read "The Pattern: Mechanics Shape Experience" table
6. Read the conclusion

**After reading, ask yourself:**

* Do I understand why D\&D is bad for political intrigue or mysteries?
* Can I explain how Blades in the Dark creates heist story pacing?
* Does it make sense that mechanics encode purpose?

**Optional homework:** Find character sheets online for D\&D 5e and Blades in the Dark. Look at them side by side. What takes up space on each? What does that tell you?

### Day 3-4: Understand the Scenarios

**Document 3: game-design-scenarios.md**

* This is very long - don't try to read it all at once
* Read strategically

**Day 3 - Read these three scenarios:**

1. Scenario 1 (Busy Adults) - Most straightforward
2. Scenario 3 (Mystery Investigation) - Shows technical challenge clearly
3. Scenario 4 (Subtle Powers) - Shows unconstrained design thinking

**For each scenario, focus on:**

* WHO ASKS FOR THIS: Is this a real request?
* SUCCESS CRITERIA: What does "working" look like?
* IDEAL VS PRACTICAL (if present): Why does system choice matter?

**Day 4 - Read these two scenarios:**
4\. Scenario 2 (Alien Cognition) - Most technically interesting
5\. Scenario 6 (Designer Ethics) - Understand boundaries

**Skip Scenario 5 (Solo Play) for now unless it particularly interests you.**

**After reading scenarios, ask yourself:**

* Which scenario is most interesting to me?
* Can I see the pattern: purpose → system design → technical challenges?
* Do I understand how TTRPGs differ from video games for these scenarios?

### Day 5: Understand the Thesis Strategy

**Document 4: thesis-topic-explanation.md**

* Short, read the whole thing
* Time: 30 minutes

**Focus on:**

* Why the topic is framed broadly (committee doesn't care about D\&D specifically)
* How TTRPGs serve as testbed for broader problems
* What will probably change (and what won't)

**After reading, ask yourself:**

* Do I understand the defense strategy?
* Does it make sense to do TTRPG research but frame it more broadly?
* Am I comfortable with this framing?

### End of Week 1: Decision Point

**At this point, you should know:**

1. Do I understand the core concepts?
2. Does this research direction interest me?
3. Which scenarios seem most interesting?

**Talk to your advisor:**

* If confused: Get clarification before proceeding
* If interested: Move to Week 2 activities
* If not interested: Discuss alternative directions

## What to Do in the Next Few Weeks

### Week 2: Deep Dive on Systems

**Goal:** Actually understand what makes different game systems work.

**Activity 1: Read System Rules (pick 2)**

Choose TWO of these systems to actually read (not just read about):

* **Blades in the Dark** (heist game, stress/flashbacks)
* **Apocalypse World** or **Dungeon World** (PbtA examples)
* **Dogs in the Vineyard** (escalation, moral choices)
* **Gumshoe** (mystery investigation)

**Where to find them:**

* Many have free "SRD" (System Reference Document) versions online
* Google "\[system name] SRD" or "\[system name] quick start"
* Budget $10-20 if you need to buy PDFs

**What to do:**

1. Read the rules (2-4 hours per system)
2. Look at the character sheet - what's emphasized?
3. Read through a sample scenario if included
4. Write notes: What experience is this trying to create? How do mechanics serve that?

**Activity 2: Watch Actual Play (Optional but Helpful)**

Find actual play videos/podcasts of the systems you read:

* Search YouTube for "\[system name] actual play"
* Watch 1-2 hours to see how it actually plays
* Notice: When do dice roll? What gets mechanical attention? What's just narrative?

**End of Week 2 Deliverable:**
Write 2-3 paragraphs per system answering:

* What experience is this system trying to create?
* What mechanics serve that purpose?
* What would this system be BAD at?

### Week 3: Analyze Scenarios

**Goal:** Deeply understand 2-3 scenarios and how they demonstrate the research.

**Activity: Pick 2-3 scenarios and answer these questions for each:**

1. **What's the experiential goal?** (What should players feel/learn/experience?)
2. **What's the TTRPG implementation challenge?** (What's technically hard?)
3. **How would this differ in a video game?** (What changes? What stays the same?)
4. **What's the general technical challenge?** (What problem applies broadly?)
5. **How would you evaluate success?** (How do you know if it worked?)

**Write 1-2 pages per scenario answering these questions.**

**End of Week 3 Deliverable:**
2-3 scenario analyses showing you understand the pattern:
Purpose → System Design → Technical Challenge → General Application

### Week 4: Write Your Own Scenarios

**Goal:** Create 1-2 scenarios based on your own interests.

**Activity: Use the scenario template to write your own**

Think about:

* What game experiences interest you?
* What problems do you see in current games?
* What would you want to build?

**Scenario Template (simplified):**

```
SCENARIO NAME: [Clear, specific]

WHO ASKS FOR THIS:
- Who is this person?
- What do they actually say?
- Why do they want this?

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
- What should players experience?
- How do you know it worked?

CURRENT SOLUTIONS & GAPS:
- What do people do now?
- Why isn't that enough?

DESIGN QUESTIONS:
- What setting/system best serves this?
- What are the technical challenges?
- How does this generalize beyond TTRPGs?
```

**Examples to inspire you:**

* "I want a game about \[topic you care about]"
* "I'm frustrated that games don't handle \[thing] well"
* "What if you could \[interesting idea]?"

**End of Week 4 Deliverable:**
1-2 scenarios you created, using the template

### Week 5: Synthesis and Decision

**Goal:** Figure out what you want to focus on.

**Activity 1: Review everything you've learned**

Look back at:

* Your system analyses (Week 2)
* Your scenario analyses (Week 3)
* Your original scenarios (Week 4)

**Questions to answer:**

1. Which scenarios (existing or yours) interest you most?
2. Why do those interest you?
3. What technical challenges seem most important/interesting?
4. What do you want to learn more about?

**Activity 2: Write a reflection (2-3 pages)**

Answer:

* What have I learned about game systems and why they matter?
* Which scenarios are most interesting to me and why?
* What would I want to focus on for thesis research?
* What questions do I still have?

**Activity 3: Meeting with advisor**

Bring your:

* System analyses
* Scenario analyses
* Original scenarios
* Reflection

Discuss:

* Is this research direction right for you?
* Which scenarios to focus on?
* What should happen next?

## Quick Reference: Reading Order

**Fastest path (if short on time):**

1. Google background (45 min)
2. games-as-experiential-scaffolds.md (1 hour)
3. understanding-ttrpg-systems.md - intro + D\&D section + one example (1 hour)
4. game-design-scenarios.md - 2 scenarios (1 hour)
5. thesis-topic-explanation.md (30 min)

**Total: \~4 hours to get basic understanding**

**Full path (recommended):**

* All of the above, plus
* Finish understanding-ttrpg-systems.md (2 more hours)
* All scenarios in game-design-scenarios.md (3 hours)
* Read actual system rules (4-8 hours)
* Watch actual play (2-4 hours)

**Total: \~15-20 hours over 1-2 weeks for solid foundation**

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to have played D\&D?**
A: No, but it helps. If you haven't, watch a few YouTube videos of people playing to get the idea.

**Q: Do I need to memorize all these systems?**
A: No. You need to understand the PATTERN (different mechanics for different purposes), not memorize every system.

**Q: What if I'm more interested in video games than TTRPGs?**
A: That's fine. The research uses TTRPGs as testbed but applies to video games. Talk to your advisor about balance.

**Q: What if none of the scenarios interest me?**
A: That's why you're writing your own! The existing scenarios are examples, not requirements.

**Q: How much of this is about programming vs game design?**
A: Both. You need to understand game design (purpose → mechanics) to build good LLM systems. The programming comes later.

**Q: What if I get stuck or confused?**
A: Stop and ask your advisor. Better to clarify early than spin your wheels.

## Success Criteria for This Phase

**You're ready to move forward if you can:**

1. **Explain the core insight:** "Purpose-built experiential scaffolds" - games designed for specific experiences
2. **Give examples:** Explain why D\&D is bad for mysteries and what system would be better
3. **Understand scenarios:** Pick one scenario and explain: who wants it, what success looks like, what's technically hard
4. **See generalization:** Explain how TTRPG scenario applies to video games or education
5. **Have opinions:** Know which scenarios interest you and why
6. **Written deliverables:** System analyses, scenario analyses, your own scenarios

**If you can do those things, you understand enough to make informed decisions about thesis direction.**

## What Comes After

Once you've completed these first weeks:

* **Narrow focus:** Pick 2-3 scenarios to concentrate on
* **Deeper research:** Literature review, technical analysis
* **Prototyping:** Start building something
* **Iteration:** Test, learn, revise

But that's future planning. For now: learn, explore, and figure out what interests you.

## Final Note

**This is exploration, not commitment.**

You're learning enough to make an informed decision. If you discover this isn't interesting to you, that's valuable information. If you discover it's fascinating, great - you've got a foundation to build on.

Take your time. Ask questions. Write things down. Talk to your advisor.

The goal isn't to rush through - it's to understand enough to know what you want to do.

Good luck!
