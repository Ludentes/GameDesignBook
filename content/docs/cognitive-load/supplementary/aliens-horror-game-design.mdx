# Aliens Horror Game: Design Document

## Overview

**Genre:** Survival horror one-shot with philosophical themes\
**Inspiration:** Blindsight (Peter Watts), Reynolds short story, Deep Rock Galactic\
**Duration:** 3-4 hours (one session, potentially two)\
**Players:** 3-4 players\
**Core Hook:** Mining operation in alien hive with magnetic fields that induce cognitive impairments

***

## Design Philosophy

### Experiential Goals

**What Players Should FEEL:**

* Dread and unease (something is very wrong here)
* Confusion and disorientation (can't trust own perceptions)
* Vulnerability (usual capabilities compromised)
* Awe at wrongness (encountering truly alien intelligence)
* Dark humor (gallows humor about horrifying situations)

**What Players Should UNDERSTAND:**

* Intelligence without consciousness exists (alien is smart but not aware)
* Consciousness is a liability (human self-awareness makes them vulnerable)
* Cognitive functions are separable (losing one function ≠ losing all)
* Adaptation under constraint (humans can compensate for impairments)
* Some things are incomprehensible (and that's okay/terrifying)

**What Players Should DO:**

* Mine resources from alien hive
* Survive encounters with alien entities
* Adapt to cognitive impairments
* Coordinate with impaired teammates
* Make tactical decisions under novel constraints

### Cognitive Load Profile

**HIGH Load (intentional):**

* **Decision Load:** Creative problem-solving under disability constraints
* **Social/Communication Load:** Coordination essential, communication challenged
* **Pattern Recognition:** Learn alien behaviors, adapt to impairments
* **Simultaneity:** Track own impairment, teammates, environment, threats, mission

**LOW Load (by design):**

* **Calculation:** Simple 2d6 resolution, no modifiers
* **Memory:** One-shot friendly, no setting lore required
* **Rules Complexity:** Learn by playing, reference cards for impairments

**MEDIUM Load (supported):**

* **Tracking:** Visual aids (map, cards) reduce burden
* **Knowledge:** Impairments are consistent and documented

**Justification:** High total load is acceptable for one-shot with engaged players. Intensity serves horror aesthetic. Turn-based play allows processing time.

***

## Core Systems

### Resolution Mechanics

**System: 2d6 + Approach**

**Approaches:**

* **Instinctive** (+2): Reflexes, autopilot, muscle memory
  * Advantage for: Blindsight, alien hand (when it helps), reflexive actions
  * Best when: Acting without thinking, split-second decisions

* **Analytical** (+1): Deliberate reasoning, careful planning
  * Advantage for: Unimpaired conscious thought
  * Disadvantage with: Most impairments (overthinking is liability)
  * Best when: Time to think, complex problem-solving

* **Coordinated** (+1 or +2 if well-coordinated): Team action
  * Requires: Communication with teammates
  * Challenged by: Aphasia, separated teammates
  * Best when: Complementary abilities combine

* **Desperate** (+0): Risky, high stakes
  * No bonus, but: Can attempt things usually impossible
  * Consequence: Success OR failure both have dramatic results
  * Best when: No other option

**Resolution:**

* **6 or less:** Failure with complication
* **7-9:** Partial success with cost
* **10+:** Success

**Key Design Choice:** No numerical modifiers for impairments. They change WHAT you can attempt and HOW (fictional positioning), not your dice pool.

### Impairment System

**Magnetic Field Effects:** Strong magnetic fields in the hive induce various cognitive impairments. Players draw 1-2 impairment cards at start or when entering high-field zones.

**Impairment Cards Include:**

#### Blindsight

**What You Can't Do:**

* Can't consciously see or describe what's in front of you
* Can't read, recognize faces, identify objects visually
* Must rely on others to tell you what you're "looking at"

**What You CAN Do:**

* Point at things instinctively (your motor system "sees")
* Make reflex saves and attacks without penalties
* Dodge without conscious awareness
* Navigate obstacles you can't describe

**How to Roleplay:**

* Say "I point at... something" not "I see the alien"
* Ask teammates "What am I pointing at?"
* Act on instinct without explanation

**Mechanical Advantage:**

* Use Instinctive approach freely
* Alien has harder time predicting your actions (you don't know what you're doing either)
* Reduced visual information overload

#### Left Visual Field Loss (or Hemispatial Neglect)

**What You Can't Do:**

* Perceive anything to your left until you physically turn
* Remember to check your left side
* Notice left-side threats without prompting

**What You CAN Do:**

* Function normally on your right side
* Turn to face left (when you remember)
* Be explicitly reminded by teammates

**How to Roleplay:**

* Never mention your left side unless you turn
* If GM says "something to your left," respond "what? I don't see anything"
* Teammates must say "look left!" to make you aware

**Mechanical Advantage:**

* Reduced information load from your right side (hyperfocus)
* Position strategically (put wall on left, threat on right)
* Alien can't flank you if you don't perceive flanking

#### Aphasia (Wernicke's Type)

**What You Can't Do:**

* Speak coherently (words come out wrong, nonsense, or substituted)
* Realize your speech is garbled (you think you're making sense)

**What You CAN Do:**

* Understand everything others say perfectly
* Communicate through drawings, gestures, pointing
* Eventually find workarounds

**How to Roleplay:**

* Speak in word salad ("The gribble is flonking the upper sideways!")
* Get frustrated when others don't understand
* Draw pictures, use gestures
* Table helps interpret what you meant

**Mechanical Advantage:**

* Can still coordinate actions (teammates learn to interpret)
* Adds dark humor to tense situations
* Alien doesn't rely on verbal communication anyway

#### Aphasia (Broca's Type)

**What You Can't Do:**

* Speak in sentences (only 2-3 words at a time)
* Express complex thoughts verbally

**What You CAN Do:**

* Understand everything perfectly
* Communicate in short phrases: "Alien! Left! Run!"
* Use gestures, drawings, actions

**How to Roleplay:**

* Limit yourself to 2-3 word phrases
* "Bad thing!" "Go now!" "Shoot there!"
* Point, gesture dramatically
* Frustrated grunts when you can't express something

**Mechanical Advantage:**

* Communication is urgent and clear (no overthinking)
* Forces concise tactical calls
* Less cognitive load in crisis (can't deliberate verbally)

#### Prosopagnosia (Face Blindness)

**What You Can't Do:**

* Recognize faces (everyone looks like a generic human)
* Identify teammates by appearance unless they have distinctive non-facial features
* Distinguish between alien entities (they all look the same)

**What You CAN Do:**

* Recognize people by voice, gait, gear, behavior
* Identify objects and non-face patterns normally
* Navigate and fight effectively

**How to Roleplay:**

* "Which one are you again?"
* Rely on voices: "Oh, you're the one with the deep voice"
* Give teammates nicknames based on gear/behavior

**Mechanical Advantage:**

* Reduced pattern-processing load (faces are cognitively expensive)
* Can focus on tactical patterns alien uses
* Not distracted by alien's disturbing appearance

#### Alien Hand Syndrome

**What You Can't Do:**

* Fully control one hand (it acts independently)
* Predict when your hand will rebel
* Prevent your hand from doing things

**What You CAN Do:**

* Use your other hand normally
* Eventually anticipate some rebellions
* Fight your own hand (awkwardly)

**How to Roleplay:**

* GM/LLM occasionally takes control of one hand
* Hand might: grab things, throw objects, flip switches, wave at alien
* React with surprise/frustration to your own hand

**Mechanical Advantage:**

* Unpredictable even to yourself (alien can't predict)
* Sometimes hand does helpful things by accident
* Dark comedy moments relieve horror tension

#### Additional Impairments (Optional/for longer campaigns)

* **Anosognosia:** Unaware you have an impairment (deny anything is wrong)
* **Capgras Delusion:** Believe teammate has been replaced by identical impostor
* **Synesthesia:** Senses cross (see sounds, hear colors)
* **Time Perception Distortion:** Time feels faster or slower than it is
* **Proprioception Loss:** Can't feel where your body parts are without looking

***

## The Alien

### Design Philosophy: Intelligence Without Consciousness

**Core Concept:** The alien/hive is an example of intelligence that doesn't require consciousness, self-awareness, or subjective experience. It's a sophisticated pattern-matching and optimization system—like a very advanced immune system or insect colony—but with no "inner life."

**Thematic Point:** This demonstrates that:

1. Intelligence ≠ consciousness
2. Consciousness makes humans predictable (we reason, hesitate, fear)
3. Pattern-based intelligence can be highly effective

### Alien Behavior Rules (LLM Guidelines)

**The alien operates on stimulus-response patterns with NO conscious deliberation:**

**Rule 1: Electromagnetic Response**

* Detects and tracks electromagnetic signatures, not visual appearance
* Mining gear, weapons, electronic devices all emit EM signatures
* Powered-down equipment is "invisible" to alien
* Can "see" through walls via EM detection

**Rule 2: Hive Optimization**

* Responds to threats to hive resource distribution
* Doesn't value individual alien units (expendable)
* Prioritizes: Hive integrity > resource protection > threat elimination
* No self-preservation instinct in individual units

**Rule 3: Learned Patterns**

* Alien defense behaviors are learned responses (IF X THEN Y)
* Highly effective but stereotyped (same pattern each time)
* Can't improvise or reason about novel situations
* Can't model what conscious beings will do (no theory of mind)

**Rule 4: Predictability Targeting**

* Targets most "normal" acting human first (predictable behavior patterns)
* Confused by impaired humans (behavior doesn't follow rational patterns)
* Can't anticipate creative/irrational solutions
* Most dangerous to unimpaired, rational, conscious humans

### What Players Observe

**Patterns They CAN Learn:**

* "It always attacks the same way when we do X"
* "It doesn't notice us when we power down equipment"
* "It ignores stealth if no EM signature"
* "It targets whoever is acting most 'normal' first"
* "It responds to hive damage immediately"

**What They CAN'T Understand:**

* WHY it does these things (no conscious motivation)
* What its ultimate "goal" is (optimization function is alien)
* How it's so effective without "thinking"
* Why it sometimes does things that seem counterproductive

**Key Mechanical Demonstration:**

* **Impaired characters** = Less predictable to alien = Harder to target effectively
* **Conscious, deliberate actions** = More predictable = Easier to counter
* **Instinctive/reflexive actions** = No conscious pattern = Alien confused

### Alien Descriptions (LLM Guidance)

**Avoid anthropomorphism:**

* ❌ "It looks angry" "It's hunting you" "It wants to kill you"
* ✅ "It orients toward EM signatures" "Its movements are purposeful but inhuman" "It doesn't register as alive in the usual way"

**Emphasize wrongness:**

* Not scary like a predator (intentional threat)
* Scary like a industrial accident (implacable, inhuman process)
* "It moves like something that doesn't need to consider its own survival"
* "Its behavior is efficient but makes no emotional sense"

**Maintain inscrutability:**

* Describe what it DOES, not what it WANTS
* "It's moving toward the mining equipment" not "It's protecting the hive"
* Leave motivation ambiguous (players project meaning)

***

## Mission Structure

### Session Opening (5-10 minutes)

**Setup:**

* Players are freelance miners/mercenaries (like Deep Rock Galactic)
* Hired to extract valuable resources from alien hive structure
* Magnetic fields in hive are known to cause "neurological anomalies"
* High pay because it's dangerous work

**Character Introduction:**

* Quick character selection (or random assignment)
* Draw impairment cards (1-2 per player)
* 30 seconds per player: "Who are you? Why are you here?"
* No backstory needed—this is a job

**Mission Briefing:**

* "Get in, mine the resources, get out"
* "Magnetic fields will mess with your head—stay alert"
* "If you encounter hostile entities, you're cleared to use lethal force"
* "Company isn't responsible for neurological damage or death"

**First Scene: Arrival**

* Dropship leaves you at hive entrance
* Immediately weird (describe magnetic field effects, hive architecture)
* First impairments manifest
* Equipment check, gear up, enter the hive

### Act 1: Exploration (30-45 minutes)

**Objective:** Reach the resource-rich area, establish mining operation

**Scenes:**

* Navigate hive tunnels (weird biology, non-Euclidean geometry)
* Impairments create coordination challenges (minor at first)
* Environmental hazards (unstable surfaces, EM interference)
* First signs of alien presence (movement, sounds, traces)
* Establish mining equipment

**Tone:** Unsettling but manageable. Players learn their impairments, start coordinating.

**End of Act 1:** First alien encounter (brief, terrifying, barely survive)

### Act 2: Complications (60-90 minutes)

**Objective:** Continue mining while dealing with alien presence and worsening impairments

**Complications (introduce gradually):**

* Hive is responding (alien activity increases)
* Magnetic fields strengthen (new/worse impairments)
* Equipment malfunctions (EM interference)
* Communications with surface are garbled
* Time pressure (storm coming, orbit window closing, something)

**Encounters:**

* Alien attacks (learn patterns through repetition)
* Environmental dangers (cave-ins, toxic spores, magnetic surges)
* Moral dilemmas (leave wounded? destroy hive sections? take more risks?)

**Player Activity:**

* Coordinate under pressure
* Adapt to impairments creatively
* Learn alien behavior (maybe)
* Make tough decisions

**Tone:** Escalating wrongness. What started weird is now dangerous. Dark humor keeps tension from being unbearable.

**End of Act 2:** Major complication (hive is collapsing, alien swarm, rescue window closing, etc.)

### Act 3: Climax (30-45 minutes)

**Objective:** Extract with resources OR just survive and escape

**Final Challenge:**

* Everything at once (alien attack + environmental crisis + time limit)
* Use everything learned (impairments, alien patterns, teamwork)
* Desperate choices (what to abandon? who goes first?)

**Possible Endings:**

* **Success:** Extract with resources, survive, get paid (but changed)
* **Pyrrhic Victory:** Escape alive but lost resources/teammates
* **Failure:** TPK or trapped in hive (horror ending)
* **Transcendence:** Weird ending (merge with hive? understand alien? become something else?)

**Resolution:**

* Immediate aftermath (who survived? what happened?)
* Debrief (discuss themes: consciousness, intelligence, disability)
* Reflection (what did we learn? how do we feel about it?)

### If Session 2 Needed

**Session 1 ends:** Cliffhanger or exhaustion (4 hours is a lot)

**Session 2 begins:**

* Quick recap (5 minutes: "You're in the hive, impairments are X/Y/Z, alien does...")
* Resume at heightened tension (already in trouble)
* Compress Act 3 (faster pacing, higher stakes)
* Satisfying conclusion (one way or another)

***

## LLM Integration

### Primary LLM Responsibilities

**1. Alien Behavior Generation**

* Follow hidden alien logic rules strictly
* Generate novel behaviors within pattern constraints
* Describe alien in non-anthropomorphic terms
* Make alien feel smart but wrong
* **Prompt guidance:** "The alien is a pattern-matching system, not a conscious being. It responds to EM signatures and learned patterns. It has no emotions, desires, or self-awareness. Describe its behavior as purposeful but inhuman."

**2. Horror Atmosphere**

* Describe wrongness (hive biology, magnetic effects, alien geometry)
* Escalate dread gradually (starts weird, gets worse)
* Narrate impairment experiences immersively
* Maintain unsettling tone without desensitizing
* **Prompt guidance:** "Emphasize the wrongness. Not jump-scares, but pervasive unease. The hive feels alive but not in a way that makes sense. Magnetic fields make reality feel untethered."

**3. Impairment Adjudication**

* Interpret how impairments affect specific actions
* Provide sensory descriptions appropriate to impairments
* Suggest creative compensations players can attempt
* Keep impairments consistent but interesting
* **Prompt guidance:** "Each impairment has specific effects (refer to cards). Describe what the character experiences, not just mechanical effects. Make impairments feel real but not purely punishing."

**4. Mission Pacing**

* Introduce complications at appropriate times
* Escalate threat as mission progresses
* Provide clues about alien behavior (but not explanations)
* Read table energy (when to push, when to ease off)
* **Prompt guidance:** "Monitor pacing. If players are stuck, introduce a complication that forces action. If players are overwhelmed, give them a moment to breathe and strategize."

### Supporting LLM Roles

**1. NPC Team Members** (if fewer than 4 players)

* Can run NPC miners with their own impairments
* Provides coordination opportunities
* Can die dramatically to raise stakes (if needed)
* **Guidance:** NPCs are competent but not spotlight-stealing

**2. Quick Reference**

* Answer rules questions in context
* Clarify impairment effects for specific situations
* Remind players of alien patterns they've observed
* **Guidance:** Be helpful without breaking immersion

### Explicit System (NOT LLM)

**1. Dice Resolution**

* 2d6 + Approach is mechanical, not LLM interpretation
* Clear thresholds: 6-, 7-9, 10+
* Players roll, LLM narrates outcome

**2. Alien Behavior Rules**

* Hidden from players but explicit for LLM
* Structured: IF (condition) THEN (response)
* Not improvised inconsistently
* **Use rule-based system underneath LLM narration**

**3. Impairment Effects**

* Each impairment has defined mechanical effects
* LLM narrates creatively but doesn't invent new rules mid-session
* Reference impairment cards as truth

**4. Map and Positioning**

* Spatial relationships are explicit (use grid or zones)
* Line of sight is deterministic
* Players can see map, make informed tactical decisions

### Hybrid (LLM + System)

**1. Alien Descriptions**

* LLM generates creative, unsettling descriptions
* System ensures they follow alien logic (non-conscious, pattern-based)
* Check: Does this description anthropomorphize? If yes, revise.

**2. Complications**

* LLM generates specific, interesting complications
* System determines WHEN complications occur (mission clock, failed rolls, act structure)
* Complications should escalate tension without feeling arbitrary

**3. Horror Escalation**

* LLM describes increasing wrongness creatively
* System structures pacing (gradual escalation, not random)
* Three-act structure guides intensity curve

***

## Playtesting Focus

### What to Observe

**Onboarding (First 15 minutes):**

* Can players start playing quickly?
* Do impairment cards communicate clearly?
* Do players understand resolution after first roll?
* Are players engaged or confused?

**Tactical Challenge (Throughout):**

* Do impairments create interesting decisions or just frustration?
* Do players coordinate creatively or give up?
* Does positioning matter or is it ignored?
* Are players finding advantages in their impairments?

**Horror Atmosphere (Throughout):**

* Do players report feeling dread/unease?
* Does alien feel intelligent but wrong?
* Does wrongness escalate appropriately or plateau?
* Is dark humor emerging naturally?

**Philosophical Emergence (End):**

* Do players notice impaired actions work better?
* Do themes come up in discussion (during or after)?
* Do players leave thinking about consciousness/intelligence?
* Did the mechanics demonstrate the philosophical point?

**Social Dynamics:**

* Is aphasia roleplay fun or frustrating?
* Do players help each other problem-solve?
* Is there balance between horror and levity?
* Does anyone feel left out or overwhelmed?

**LLM Performance:**

* Does alien behavior feel consistent?
* Does LLM maintain atmosphere without desensitizing?
* Does impairment adjudication work smoothly?
* Are descriptions evocative or generic?

### Iteration Points

**If Load Too High:**

* Reduce simultaneity (fewer threats at once)
* Simplify resources (even more abstract)
* Extend session time or split into two
* Provide more explicit guidance/prompts

**If Impairments Not Mattering:**

* Make advantages more explicit
* Demonstrate alien targeting conscious characters first
* Add mechanical bonuses for impaired actions
* Coach players on creative uses

**If Alien Feels Random:**

* Tighten LLM prompt with explicit rules
* Make patterns more obvious/learnable
* Add "what have we learned?" recap moments
* Ensure alien responses are consistent

**If Horror Not Landing:**

* Adjust LLM prompting for atmosphere
* Escalate wrongness earlier
* Add more visceral/sensory descriptions
* Use environmental horror (not just alien)

**If Themes Not Emerging:**

* Add explicit moments highlighting theme (impaired character succeeds where conscious one fails)
* Prompt post-session discussion more actively
* Make alien's non-consciousness more obvious
* Show consequences of overthinking vs. instinct

**If Coordination Not Happening:**

* Increase mechanical bonuses for teamwork
* Create situations requiring coordination
* Coach players on communication despite aphasia
* Celebrate creative coordination attempts

***

## Post-Session Debrief

### Immediate Reflection (5-10 minutes)

**Guided Questions:**

1. "What moment stood out to you?" (emotional high points)
2. "When did you feel most vulnerable?" (horror beats)
3. "What surprised you about your impairment?" (discovery)
4. "Did you notice anything weird about how the alien behaved?" (pattern recognition)

**Purpose:** Decompress, share experiences, validate feelings

### Thematic Discussion (10-15 minutes)

**Guided Questions:**

1. "Do you think the alien was conscious? Why or why not?"
2. "Did your impairment make you more or less effective? How?"
3. "What does this say about consciousness as a survival strategy?"
4. "Could intelligence exist without self-awareness?"
5. "How did it feel to roleplay cognitive impairment?"

**Purpose:** Surface philosophical themes, connect experience to ideas

### Design Reflection (5 minutes, if group is interested)

**Meta Questions:**

1. "What worked about the system?"
2. "What was frustrating or confusing?"
3. "Did the mechanics serve the experience?"
4. "Would you play this again? What would you change?"

**Purpose:** Gather feedback for iteration

***

## Design Insights

### What This System Demonstrates

**Cognitive Load as Design Tool:**

* High load is acceptable for one-shot with engaged players
* Load serves experience (challenge + horror + coordination)
* Visual aids and simple math support high complexity elsewhere

**Mechanics as Philosophy:**

* Alien behavior rules demonstrate intelligence without consciousness
* Impairments show cognitive functions are separable
* Success of impaired actions shows consciousness as liability
* **The system IS the argument**

**Constraints as Content:**

* Impairments aren't just penalties—they're asymmetric abilities
* Novel constraints create novel tactics
* Players must think creatively, not optimally
* Limitation becomes interesting through context

**LLM Role Clarity:**

* LLM handles atmosphere, adaptation, creative description
* Explicit systems handle rules, positioning, consistency
* Hybrid approach (LLM generates within constraints) works best
* Clear division prevents inconsistency and confusion

**Thematic Emergence:**

* Don't lecture themes—let them emerge from play
* Mechanics demonstrate ideas more powerfully than narration
* Post-session discussion makes implicit explicit
* Experience first, analysis second

### What Makes This Different from Existing Games

**Not Fate:**

* Higher load, tactical spatial reasoning matters
* Impairments are mechanical and roleplay simultaneously
* Alien behavior has hidden logic (not GM whim)
* Approaches weighted differently (Instinctive is often best)

**Not D\&D/traditional RPGs:**

* No combat grid tactics (different kind of spatial reasoning)
* No character builds or progression (one-shot)
* Impairments replace class abilities (asymmetric coordination)
* Horror atmosphere is mechanical, not just narrative

**Not Call of Cthulhu:**

* Alien is understandable (partially), not cosmic horror
* Sanity isn't health pool—impairments are tactical
* Players can succeed through adaptation, not just survive
* Intelligence is theme, not incomprehensibility

**Novel Synthesis:**

* Tactical challenge through cognitive constraints
* Philosophical themes through mechanical demonstration
* Horror from wrongness (not from powerlessness)
* LLM maintains alien intelligence without anthropomorphism

***

## Future Development

### Potential Expansions

**Campaign Mode:**

* Track long-term consequences of impairments
* Character development (learning to live with disabilities)
* Escalating alien intelligence (hive learns from encounters)
* Corporate conspiracy (why are they really mining?)

**Additional Scenarios:**

* Different alien types (each with different non-conscious intelligence)
* Varied environments (underwater hive, asteroid colony, alien megastructure)
* Different impairments (sensory, motor, emotional, temporal)
* Mixed teams (some impaired, some not—explore dynamics)

**Deeper Systems:**

* Impairment combinations (multiple disabilities interact)
* Equipment that compensates (but adds different constraints)
* Hive ecosystem (other creatures, symbiosis, complexity)
* Magnetic field manipulation (turn environment to advantage)

### Open Questions

**The "Smarter Than Author" Problem:**

* How to write alien intelligence that feels genuinely superior?
* LLM can generate novel behaviors, but are they truly "smarter"?
* Is inscrutability necessary, or can we show alien reasoning?
* How to balance learnable patterns with genuine otherness?

**The Magic Problem Parallel:**

* Keep alien part of system (consistent rules) but incomprehensible?
* King's magic (unknowable) vs. WoW magic (mechanical)
* Can we have both? Consistent logic that feels fundamentally alien?
* Resolution: Alien follows rules players can't fully understand (like physics for ants)

**Accessibility Considerations:**

* Is roleplay of cognitive impairments offensive or educational?
* How to handle players with actual cognitive disabilities?
* Could this increase empathy or trivialize real impairments?
* Need to be respectful, get feedback from disability community

**Replayability:**

* Does one-shot work with same players twice?
* Different impairments change experience significantly
* Could procedurally generate different hives/aliens
* Or embrace one-shot as complete experience

***

## Conclusion

This system demonstrates that **cognitive load analysis can generate novel game systems** tailored to specific experiential goals. By starting with "what should players feel/understand/do" and mapping cognitive load requirements, we arrived at mechanics that:

1. **Serve the horror aesthetic** (confusion, vulnerability, wrongness)
2. **Demonstrate philosophical themes** (intelligence ≠ consciousness, consciousness = liability)
3. **Create tactical challenge** (coordination under novel constraints)
4. **Enable meaningful roleplay** (impairments are interesting, not just penalties)
5. **Utilize LLM strengths** (alien behavior, atmosphere) while avoiding weaknesses (calculation, consistency)

The framework validated: when you design **purpose-built experiential scaffolds**, the mechanics emerge naturally from your goals.

**Document Status:** Ready for playtesting and iteration\
**Next Steps:** Run session, observe players, refine based on feedback\
**Key Success Metric:** Do players leave thinking about consciousness and intelligence? Did they have fun despite/because of the horror?
