# Chapter 4: Cognitive Load and Game System Design

Consider two beloved strategy games with completely different cognitive demands:

**StarCraft** (1998): Rules fit on two pages. Units have 3-4 abilities maximum. A competent player can explain the entire game in 10 minutes.

But you're managing three bases simultaneously while your opponent attacks. You know you should scout, expand, build units, and harass—but you can't do all of it. Every second, you're choosing what deserves your attention and what you'll sacrifice. Skill comes from **prioritizing under time pressure**—you know what to do, you just can't do it all.

**Warhammer 40,000**: Hundreds of pages of rules. Units have layers of special abilities, stratagems, faction bonuses, and interaction effects. It takes months to memorize your own army, let alone understand all opponents.

But it's turn-based. You have all the time you need. Skill comes from **deep knowledge and preparation**—remembering that obscure rule that counters your opponent's strategy, building lists that exploit synergies, understanding interactions three steps deep.

Same constraint (human cognitive limits), different manifestations: **simultaneity load** (StarCraft) versus **complexity load** (Warhammer). Both create skill expression. Both reward investment. But they demand fundamentally different mental capacities.

This is cognitive load—the mental effort required to play your game. It's not good or bad inherently. It's **investment that must match both your aesthetic requirements and your audience's capacity**.

Mastery aesthetic *requires* high cognitive investment. Players can't develop deep system understanding without sustained mental effort. If you reduce load too much, you remove the very complexity that Mastery players seek.

Submission aesthetic *requires* low cognitive investment. Players seeking relaxation and flow can't achieve that state if tracking, decision-making, and execution demands overwhelm them. If you increase load too much, you destroy the calm they're seeking.

**Your job as a designer:** Create the cognitive load profile that serves your aesthetic goals and respects your audience's investment capacity. This chapter shows you how.

## The Cognitive Budget

### Cognitive Load as Constraint

From Chapter 3, we established the critical distinction: **Resources are in-game entities players manage strategically. Constraints are external factors that limit design possibilities.**

Cognitive load is a constraint, not a resource:

* You can't "spend" attention and "recover" it like hit points
* You can't "trade" focus for other capacities
* It's not tracked by the game system
* It's a fundamental limitation on what players can handle

**Why this matters:**

* **Resources**: Design through scarcity, recovery patterns, spending mechanics (Chapter 3)
* **Constraints**: Design through simplification, support systems, strategic allocation (this chapter)

Treating cognitive load as a resource leads to confused design. You can't create "attention recovery mechanics" or "focus points to spend." You CAN create support systems that reduce unnecessary load and optimize necessary load.

**The practical implication:** You have a fixed cognitive budget determined by your target audience. Every design decision either respects that budget or exceeds it. Exceed it too much, and players become overwhelmed, frustrated, or disengaged.

**Cross-reference:** Chapter 1 established cognitive investment profiles (Casual, Midcore, Hardcore). These profiles determine your available cognitive budget—what follows shows how to allocate it.

### The Investment-Payoff Principle

From Chapter 1: "Aesthetic payoff must match cognitive investment capacity."

This is the central organizing principle for cognitive load design. Let's make it operational.

**The three-way relationship:**

```
AESTHETIC GOAL (what experience do you want to create?)
    ↓
REQUIRED LOAD PROFILE (what cognitive investment does this aesthetic need?)
    ↓
AUDIENCE CAPACITY (what investment can your target audience provide?)
    ↓
DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (what's actually possible?)
    ↓
LOAD MANAGEMENT (how to optimize within constraints)
```

**Success means matching all three elements.**

### Success Case: Vampire Survivors

**Aesthetic:** Submission (flow state, relaxation, "brain off" satisfaction)

**Required Load Profile:** Very low across all dimensions

* Tracking: Minimal (health, experience, time—that's it)
* Decision: Almost none (movement only, everything else automatic)
* Execution: Very low (simple WASD movement, no timing requirements)

**Audience:** Casual to Midcore (10-30 minute sessions, often playing while doing other things)

**Design Decisions:**

* Combat fully automated (weapons fire themselves)
* No resource management beyond XP
* Upgrades presented as clear 3-option choices every level
* No timing-critical mechanics
* Visual clarity prioritized (always know where danger is)

**Result:** Perfect match. The aesthetic requires low load, audience has limited capacity, design respects both constraints. Players achieve flow state within 30 seconds. Game became massive success despite—or because of—its simplicity.

**Investment-to-payoff ratio:** Minimal investment, pure aesthetic payoff.

### Success Case: Path of Exile

**Aesthetic:** Mastery (deep system understanding, endless optimization)

**Required Load Profile:** Very high across multiple dimensions

* Tracking: Hundreds of mechanics interactions, damage calculations, gear affixes, build-enabling items
* Decision: Massive (skill tree with 1000+ nodes, 200+ support gems, countless build variations)
* Execution: Moderate (needs reasonable reflexes but not esports-level)

**Audience:** Hardcore (100+ hour investment expected, players want this complexity)

**Design Decisions:**

* Intentionally complex passive tree (overwhelming at first, mastery-rewarding long-term)
* Deep crafting systems with dozens of currencies
* Hidden mechanics that reward research (breakpoints, effective HP calculations)
* Regular expansions adding more systems (complexity as feature, not bug)
* Community wikis and tools accepted as necessary (offloading complexity)

**Result:** Perfect match. The aesthetic *requires* this load—you can't create "endless optimization" without actual complexity to optimize. Hardcore audience has capacity and *desires* this investment. Design deliberately maximizes depth.

**Investment-to-payoff ratio:** Massive investment, massive aesthetic payoff for target audience.

### Success Case: Hades

**Aesthetic:** Challenge + Progression + Narrative (multiple aesthetics for midcore audience)

**Required Load Profile:** Medium (must balance multiple demands)

* Tracking: Moderate (boon effects, enemy patterns, room rewards)
* Decision: Moderate (build composition, path choices, upgrade priorities)
* Execution: Moderate to high (requires skill but has forgiving timing windows)

**Audience:** Midcore (30-60 minute sessions, wants depth but has time constraints)

**Design Decisions:**

* 20-30 minute runs (complete macro loop per session)
* Permanent meta-progression (respects that players won't master mechanics instantly)
* Session recaps when returning (reduces memory load between sessions)
* Gradual unlocks (progressive disclosure, not overwhelming at start)
* Narrative delivered in digestible chunks (no massive exposition dumps)

**Result:** Perfect match. Multiple aesthetics accessible because load carefully distributed. Midcore audience can engage meaningfully in limited sessions. Design respects time constraints while delivering depth.

**Investment-to-payoff ratio:** Moderate investment per session, strong aesthetic payoff across all target aesthetics.

### Failure Case: Destiny 2 (2017 Launch)

**Aesthetic:** Power Fantasy + Fellowship (MMO-lite shooter)

**Intended Audience:** Hardcore (Bungie expected 100+ hour engagement)

**Actual Load Profile:** Low

* Tracking: Minimal (few stats, simple gear)
* Decision: Very low (obvious best gear, limited build variety)
* Execution: Moderate (shooter mechanics)

**The Problem:** Load too LOW for intended audience.

Hardcore players wanted systems to master. The game gave them simple mechanics with no depth. Power Fantasy aesthetic satisfied initially, but nothing to optimize long-term. Players completed content in weeks, found no reason to continue.

**Result:** Massive player exodus after first month. "There's nothing to do" became community refrain. Not because of insufficient content—because of insufficient complexity to engage hardcore audience.

**Fix:** Later expansions (Forsaken, Beyond Light) added:

* Complex mod systems (build optimization)
* Champion mechanics (tactical requirements)
* Deeper stat interactions (cooldown reduction builds, ability loops)
* Seasonal artifact with choices (planning depth)

Investment increased, hardcore audience returned. The game found its load profile.

**Investment-to-payoff ratio (launch):** Low investment matched to high-investment audience = boredom.

**Investment-to-payoff ratio (fixed):** Medium-high investment, now appropriate for audience.

### Failure Case: Tutorial Hell

**The Pattern:** Many AAA games frontload 20+ mechanics in first 2 hours.

**The Problem:** Even hardcore players can't absorb information this fast.

**Examples:**

* Final Fantasy XIII: 20+ hours of tutorial systems
* Metal Gear Solid V: 30 minute prologue overwhelming with mechanics
* Many Assassin's Creed entries: Tutorial sections exceeding actual playtime

**Why It Fails:**

* Cognitive budget exceeded before play begins
* Players forget mechanics before using them
* Creates impression of complexity even if underlying systems simple
* Violates progressive disclosure principle

**Result:** Players bounce off despite being target audience. Load *timing* wrong, not just amount.

### Failure Case: Mobile Puzzle Games with F2P Economies

**Aesthetic:** Submission or Challenge (puzzle-solving)

**Audience:** Casual (short sessions, seeking simple engagement)

**Design Load:** Meta-game far exceeds puzzle load

* Multiple currencies (soft, hard, premium, event-specific)
* Energy systems (time-gated, purchasable)
* Social features (guilds, gifting, competitions)
* Events (limited-time, multiple concurrent)
* Daily bonuses, login rewards, milestone tracks

**The Problem:** Came for puzzles, drowning in economy.

Tracking load of meta-systems exceeds tracking load of actual puzzles. Decision fatigue from constant "spend this currency now?" prompts. Casual audience seeking relaxation instead faces complex resource optimization.

**Result:** Many players either disengage or ignore meta-game entirely (leaving money on table from design perspective, but showing the mismatch).

**Investment-to-payoff ratio:** High investment in meta-game, minimal aesthetic payoff (puzzles could be engaging without economy).

### The Design Test

For every system, mechanic, or feature you add, ask:

1. **What cognitive investment does this require?** (tracking, decisions, execution)
2. **What aesthetic payoff does it create?** (serves which experience?)
3. **Does the payoff justify the investment for my target audience?**

If the answer to #3 is no, you have three options:

* **Reduce investment** (simplify, automate, offload)
* **Increase payoff** (make the feature serve aesthetic more directly)
* **Cut it** (investment never justified, remove entirely)

**The most common mistake:** Adding features that seem cool individually but create investment without proportional payoff. Death by a thousand cuts—each feature acceptable alone, together they exceed budget.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Investment-payoff principle validated across thousands of games. Success and failure patterns consistently match load-aesthetic-audience alignment or misalignment.

## The Three Load Types

Cognitive load manifests in three distinct ways. Understanding these types lets you diagnose where load comes from and how to manage it appropriately.

### Tracking Load: Monitoring State

**What it is:** Mental effort required to remember and monitor current game state.

**What players track:**

* Resource values (health, mana, ammunition, gold)
* Status effects (buffs, debuffs, timers, cooldowns)
* Positions (unit locations, enemy positions, waypoints)
* Progress states (quest objectives, collectibles found, areas explored)
* Relationships (faction standings, NPC opinions, unlocked content)

**Observable behaviors:**

**Low tracking load:**

* Players glance at UI briefly, understand state instantly
* Can resume play after interruption without confusion
* Rarely ask "wait, what was I doing?"
* Make decisions confidently based on visible information

**High tracking load:**

* Players constantly check UI elements
* Take notes or use external trackers
* Pause frequently to remember state
* Lost after interruptions (need to rebuild mental model)

**Medium tracking load:**

* Occasional UI checking, mostly internalized
* Brief moment needed to re-orient after breaks
* Can usually remember important state

### Examples Across Load Levels

**Very Low Tracking Load:**

**Untitled Goose Game** (2019):

* Track: Your position, current objective, items in area
* That's it. No resources, no stats, no complex state.
* Can stop mid-task, return hours later, instantly understand situation.
* Tracking load intentionally minimized to serve comedic Discovery aesthetic.

**Low Tracking Load:**

**DOOM (2016)**:

* Track: Health, armor, ammunition (3 numbers, always visible)
* Enemy positions (clearly telegraphed, color-coded)
* Objective marker (always shows direction)
* No complex interactions, no status effects, no resource dependencies.
* Allows focus on execution (shooting, moving) not state monitoring.

**Medium Tracking Load:**

**Slay the Spire** (2017):

* Track: Current HP, deck composition (\~20 cards), relics (\~10), potions (\~3)
* Enemy intents (shown explicitly each turn)
* Card effects and interactions (limited set per run)
* Block value, energy, draw pile state
* Manageable because turn-based (no simultaneity) and information always visible.

**High Tracking Load:**

**Crusader Kings 3** (2020):

* Track: Dozens of characters with relationships, claims, traits
* Multiple resource pools, building construction, army compositions
* Diplomatic states, religious authority, cultural innovations
* Succession laws, vassal opinions, scheme progress
* Hundreds of variables across multiple time scales.
* Requires note-taking, spreadsheets, or exceptional memory.
* *This serves the Mastery aesthetic*—complexity is the point.

**Very High Tracking Load:**

**Dwarf Fortress**:

* Track: Hundreds of dwarves with individual needs, skills, relationships
* Complex material interactions (metal types, rock layers, aquifer mechanics)
* Multi-level fortress layouts (z-axis spatial reasoning)
* Trading relationships, military threats, production chains
* Literally impossible to hold entire state in working memory.
* Requires external tools, note-taking, specialized UI mods.
* *Intentionally extreme*—serves niche Mastery audience that wants exactly this.

### When High Tracking Load Works

**Investigation archetype** (Chapter 2): Evidence gathering requires tracking clues, connections, theories. High tracking load serves Discovery/Mastery aesthetics.

**Example: Return of the Obra Dinn** (2018)

* Track: 60 crew members, cause of death, relationships, timeline
* Intentionally overwhelming—deduction IS the challenge
* Provides journal (external support) but requires mental model
* High tracking load directly creates intended aesthetic (figuring out the mystery)

**4X Strategy archetype**: Empire management requires tracking many interconnected systems. High tracking load serves Mastery aesthetic.

**Example: Civilization VI**

* Track: Multiple cities, resources, diplomatic relationships, tech progress, military positioning
* Complexity creates strategic depth—this is what players want
* Turn-based structure allows time to process tracking load
* Target audience (hardcore strategy players) has capacity and desire for this load

**When it doesn't work:** High tracking load for aesthetics that don't require it.

**Anti-example: Early MMORPGs with 40+ ability rotations**

* Track: Complex cooldowns, buff durations, resource cycles
* Aesthetic: Power Fantasy, Fellowship (raiding together)
* Problem: Tracking load exceeded aesthetic requirements
* Fix: Modern MMOs simplified rotations (fewer abilities, clearer priorities)

### Decision Load: Evaluating Options

**What it is:** Mental effort required to evaluate options and choose actions.

**What creates decision load:**

* Number of options available (action space)
* Complexity of evaluating each option (calculation required)
* Interdependencies between choices (combo effects, synergies)
* Hidden information (uncertainty about outcomes)
* Irreversibility (permanent consequences, must choose carefully)

**Observable behaviors:**

**Low decision load:**

* Players choose quickly and confidently
* Obvious right/wrong answers (or all choices roughly equivalent)
* Little analysis paralysis
* Can explain reasoning in seconds

**High decision load:**

* Players pause frequently to think
* Analyze trade-offs carefully
* May discuss options with others or use calculators
* Satisfaction from making good choices

**Medium decision load:**

* Brief consideration before choosing
* Clear priorities but meaningful differences
* Occasional challenging decisions

### Examples Across Load Levels

**Very Low Decision Load:**

**Vampire Survivors**:

* Decisions: Move left/right/up/down
* Level-up: Choose 1 of 3 options (with clear stat descriptions)
* That's it. No complex choices, no long-term planning.
* Serves Submission aesthetic perfectly.

**Low Decision Load:**

**Animal Crossing: New Horizons** (2020):

* Decisions: What to catch, what to craft, where to place furniture
* All options positive (no wrong choices)
* No scarcity pressure (unlimited time)
* Serves Submission aesthetic—choices are expression, not optimization.

**Medium Decision Load:**

**Into the Breach** (2018):

* Decisions: 3 units, 3-4 actions each, 8-12 enemies
* Must evaluate: Attack order, positioning, which buildings to save
* Math is straightforward (damage values visible)
* Manageable because small action space (not 100 options)
* Serves tactical Challenge aesthetic without overwhelming.

**High Decision Load:**

**Gloomhaven** (2017):

* Decisions: Card combos, initiative order, positioning, long-term hand management
* Must evaluate: Current turn value vs. future turn setup
* Hidden information (other players' cards, enemy AI decks)
* Complex interdependencies (combo with teammates)
* Serves tactical Challenge + cooperative Fellowship aesthetics.
* Target audience (hardcore board gamers) has capacity for this.

**Very High Decision Load:**

**Chess**:

* Decisions: Theoretically 30-40 legal moves per turn
* Must evaluate: Material value, positional advantages, tactics, strategy
* Consequences cascade (single move can determine game)
* Infinite depth (people study for lifetimes)
* Serves pure Challenge/Mastery aesthetic.
* High decision load IS the game.

### When High Decision Load Works

**Puzzle archetype**: Decision-making is the entire aesthetic. High load serves Challenge/Mastery.

**Example: The Witness** (2016)

* Decisions: How to draw line through puzzle grid
* Must evaluate: Rules, patterns, environmental clues
* Aesthetic payoff directly from decision complexity
* Each puzzle is pure decision load—that's what players want

**Tactical combat archetype**: Meaningful choices under constraints. High decision load serves Challenge aesthetic.

**Example: XCOM 2**

* Decisions: Squad positioning, ability usage, target priority, risk management
* Must evaluate: Hit chances, cover positions, enemy abilities, mission timer
* Consequences severe (permadeath, mission failure)
* High decision load creates tension and satisfaction from good choices

**When it doesn't work:** High decision load for aesthetics that don't require it.

**Anti-example: Games with false choices**

* Many options, but optimal choice obvious (illusion of depth)
* Players quickly learn dominant strategy, ignore other options
* Decision load creates friction without aesthetic payoff
* Example: RPGs with 30 skills, 3 viable builds (27 skills are trap options)

### Execution Load: Performing Actions

**What it is:** Mental effort required to physically perform actions correctly.

**What creates execution load:**

* Timing requirements (precision windows, rhythm)
* Coordination demands (multiple inputs simultaneously)
* Reaction speed (responding to stimuli quickly)
* Physical skill (muscle memory, APM—actions per minute)
* Spatial reasoning (3D positioning, aiming)

**Observable behaviors:**

**Low execution load:**

* Actions succeed reliably when intended
* No timing precision required
* Works with any input speed
* Accessible across skill levels

**High execution load:**

* Actions fail frequently until mastered
* Requires practice and muscle memory
* Fast reactions necessary
* Skill gap between novice and expert visible

**Medium execution load:**

* Some precision helpful but forgiving
* Can succeed with moderate skill
* Practice improves performance but not required

### Examples Across Load Levels

**Very Low Execution Load:**

**Disco Elysium** (2019):

* Actions: Click dialogue options, click to move
* Zero timing requirements, zero coordination
* Turn-based (effectively), no reflexes needed
* Serves Narrative aesthetic—execution can't interfere.

**Low Execution Load:**

**Peggle** (2007):

* Actions: Aim, click to shoot
* No timing pressure (unlimited thinking time)
* Physics handles complexity (not player execution)
* Serves Submission aesthetic—accessible to all skill levels.

**Medium Execution Load:**

**Hades**:

* Actions: Dash, attack, special, cast (4 buttons)
* Timing matters but windows generous
* Can succeed through positioning not just reflexes
* Serves Challenge aesthetic but accessible to midcore audience.

**High Execution Load:**

**Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** (2019):

* Actions: Precise parry timing (frame-perfect), dodge timing, attack patterns
* Must react quickly to enemy attacks
* Requires muscle memory and pattern recognition
* Serves Challenge aesthetic specifically through execution mastery.
* Target audience (hardcore action players) wants this difficulty.

**Very High Execution Load:**

**StarCraft II** (professional play):

* Actions: 300+ APM (actions per minute), 5 actions per second
* Simultaneous management across multiple locations
* Build order memorization, hotkey precision, micro and macro simultaneously
* Serves Competition + Mastery aesthetics at highest level
* Most demanding execution load in mainstream gaming

### When High Execution Load Works

**Real-time action archetype**: Physical skill expression. High execution load serves Challenge aesthetic.

**Example: Celeste** (2018)

* Execution: Precise platforming, tight timing windows
* Aesthetic payoff from mastering difficult movement
* Provides assist mode (load reduction for those who want story not execution challenge)
* Design explicitly acknowledges execution load serves specific aesthetic

**Fighting game archetype**: Execution mastery as core skill expression.

**Example: Street Fighter V**

* Execution: Frame-perfect combos, consistent inputs under pressure
* Target audience wants execution barrier (part of competitive depth)
* High execution load creates skill-based Competition aesthetic
* Some players specifically enjoy execution challenge (separate from strategy)

**When it doesn't work:** High execution load for aesthetics that don't require it.

**Anti-example: Mystery games with twitch sections**

* Aesthetic: Discovery, solving puzzles through deduction
* Suddenly requires fast reflexes for QTE or chase sequence
* Execution load unrelated to aesthetic goal
* Blocks progress for players with the cognitive capacity for mystery but not execution speed

### How Load Types Combine

**Total cognitive burden = Tracking + Decision + Execution** (simultaneously)

Real-time games have high simultaneity pressure:

* StarCraft: Medium tracking + High decision + High execution = Very High total (but serves aesthetic)
* Dark Souls: Medium tracking + Medium decision + High execution = High total (appropriate for hardcore audience)

Turn-based games can support higher tracking/decision because execution minimal:

* Civilization: Very High tracking + High decision + Low execution = Very High total (appropriate because turn-based)
* Into the Breach: Low tracking + High decision + Low execution = Medium total (intentional accessibility)

**The designer's challenge:** Total load must match aesthetic requirements AND audience capacity. You can trade off between types, but you can't exceed total budget.

**From Chapter 1:** Player investment profiles determine total budget:

* **Casual:** 3-5 load units total
* **Midcore:** 5-8 load units total
* **Hardcore:** 8-15+ load units total

(These are qualitative, not exact numbers—but the principle holds.)

**Confidence Level:** HIGH - Three load types framework validated across game analysis and player research. Observable behaviors consistently map to load levels.

## Load Sources and Budget Allocation

The three load types describe HOW cognitive load manifests. But WHERE does it come from? Understanding load sources lets you allocate your budget strategically.

### The Four Primary Sources

From synthesis framework (Chapter 1 reference), cognitive load budget allocation:

1. **Core mechanic** (largest portion—this is what players came for)
2. **Resource management** (Chapter 3 creates this)
3. **Goal/progress tracking** (where am I in loops?)
4. **Context/meta-progression** (understanding the game world and long-term systems)

Plus for multiplayer:
5\. **Social/communication** (coordination, deception, reputation management)

**The allocation principle:** Core mechanic should consume most of your budget. Everything else should justify its cognitive cost by serving the aesthetic.

### Source 1: Core Mechanic

**What it is:** The primary interaction players perform repeatedly.

**Why it's largest:** This is where aesthetic payoff happens. Tracking load, decision load, or execution load from core mechanic directly creates intended experience.

**Casual games: 60-80% of budget to core mechanic**

* Example: Vampire Survivors—movement is core, everything else automated
* Example: Wordle—word deduction is core, no other systems

**Midcore games: 40-60% of budget to core mechanic**

* Example: Hades—combat is core, build decisions and narrative support but don't overwhelm
* Example: Slay the Spire—deckbuilding + combat is core, meta-progression minimal

**Hardcore games: 30-50% of budget to core mechanic**

* Example: Path of Exile—combat is core but build optimization equally important
* Example: Crusader Kings 3—character interactions core but many supporting systems

**Why hardcore allocates less to core:** Because they have larger total budget. Absolute load on core mechanic can be higher even though percentage lower.

**Design test:** Can players engage with core mechanic immediately, or do supporting systems block access? If supporting systems dominate cognitive budget, you've misallocated.

### Source 2: Resource Management

**What it creates:** Tracking load (monitoring resource values) + Decision load (spending choices)

**From Chapter 3:** Resources are Parameters (Component 2) that create strategic decisions.

**Resource types and their cognitive costs:**

**Consumables** (potions, ammunition): Medium tracking load

* Must monitor current quantity
* Must decide when to use vs. save
* Psychological pressure from scarcity (hoarding)

**Buffers** (health, mana): Low tracking load

* Single value, clearly displayed
* Current state always visible
* Decisions mostly "keep this high"

**Accumulations** (gold, XP): Low tracking load

* Usually increasing, not decreasing (less pressure)
* Decisions deferred to spending moments
* Can ignore until needed

**Composition resources** (gear sets, skill builds): Very high tracking load

* Must understand interactions between pieces
* Interdependencies multiply complexity
* Requires system mastery

**Trackers** (quest progress, collections): Low tracking load

* Usually passive (game tells you what's left)
* Decision-free (just completion goals)

**The 3-5 resource guideline from Chapter 3 is fundamentally a cognitive load constraint.**

**Casual games: 1-3 significant resources**

* Example: Monument Valley—only resource is "progress through level"
* Example: Unpacking—no resources, just task completion

**Midcore games: 3-5 significant resources**

* Example: Hades—health, gold, darkness, keys, nectar (5, but some passive)
* Example: Dead Cells—health, gold, cells (3 primary)

**Hardcore games: 5-15+ resources, often with interdependencies**

* Example: Path of Exile—health, mana, dozens of currencies, gear affixes, map modifications
* Example: Factorio—iron, copper, coal, oil, dozens of intermediate products

**Design test:** Can players track all resources without external tools? If they need spreadsheets for resource management, you've exceeded budget (unless targeting hardcore Mastery aesthetic that expects this).

**Integration with Chapter 3:**

* Limiter resources (health, ammunition): Create tracking pressure, serve Challenge/Tension
* Currency resources (gold, XP): Create decision load, serve Mastery/Progression
* Tracker resources (collectibles): Create completion goals, serve Collection aesthetic
* Meta-resources (unlocks): Create long-term load across sessions

### Source 3: Goal/Progress Tracking

**What it creates:** Tracking load (what am I doing?) + minimal decision load (what next?)

**Why it matters:** Players need to know current objective, progress toward it, and what's next. Confusion here kills engagement.

**From synthesis framework:** Different loop scales need different goal clarity.

**Micro loops (seconds to minutes):**

* Goal must be instantly clear
* "Kill enemies" "Reach checkpoint" "Solve puzzle"
* Zero cognitive load—should be obvious

**Meso loops (minutes to half hour):**

* Goal must be trackable
* "Complete dungeon" "Finish quest" "Win match"
* Low cognitive load—visible progress bar or objective marker

**Macro loops (session to run):**

* Goal should provide direction
* "Reach next boss" "Complete chapter" "Advance campaign"
* Medium cognitive load—may need journal or quest log

**Meta loops (between sessions):**

* Goal provides long-term purpose
* "Unlock all characters" "Master all builds" "Complete collection"
* High cognitive load—requires remembering across weeks/months

**Casual games: Only micro and meso goals**

* Example: Peggle—clear current board (meso), current shot (micro)
* No macro or meta—each session complete

**Midcore games: Micro, meso, and macro goals**

* Example: Hades—current room (micro), current run (meso), story progress (macro)
* Meta optional (unlocks, relationships)

**Hardcore games: All four scales**

* Example: Destiny 2—current fight (micro), current mission (meso), current campaign (macro), seasonal objectives (meta)

**Design test:** If players frequently ask "what should I do now?" your goal tracking creates too much load or is too unclear.

**Goal clarity reduces load:** Objective markers, quest logs, visual progress indicators all externalize goal tracking. Without these, players must hold goals in memory (high load).

### Source 4: Context/Meta-Progression

**What it creates:** Tracking load (understanding world state) + Decision load (meta-level choices)

**From Chapter 2:** Context includes archetype, setting, medium. Here we're concerned with how much contextual knowledge players must maintain.

**Minimal context load:**

* Abstract games (Tetris, Chess—no world to understand)
* Self-contained scenarios (Portal—this test chamber, that's all)

**Low context load:**

* Simple settings (Mario—rescue princess, that's the lore)
* Clear good/evil (no moral complexity to track)

**Medium context load:**

* Moderate world complexity (Hades—mythology references, relationships to track)
* Some hidden information (mystery elements)

**High context load:**

* Complex narratives (Disco Elysium—political factions, relationships, backstory)
* Rich lore (Dark Souls—environmental storytelling, item descriptions, timeline puzzles)

**Very high context load:**

* Multiple interconnected systems (Crusader Kings—dynasties, religions, cultures, histories)
* Emergent narratives (Dwarf Fortress—generated world with centuries of history)

**Meta-progression adds persistent load:**

* Permanent unlocks (must remember what's available)
* Account-level systems (seasonal passes, battle passes, currencies)
* Long-term goals (achievements, collections)

**Casual games: Minimal context, no meta-progression**

* Each session self-contained
* No need to remember anything between plays

**Midcore games: Moderate context, optional meta-progression**

* Can follow story without mastering lore
* Meta-progression provides goals but not required

**Hardcore games: High context, extensive meta-progression**

* Lore mastery expected and rewarded
* Meta-systems are significant part of engagement

**Design test:** Can players jump in after a week and remember what matters? If not, you need better resumption support or are targeting wrong audience.

### Source 5: Social/Communication (Multiplayer)

**What it creates:** All three load types simultaneously

* Tracking: Other players' states, team composition, roles
* Decision: Coordination, deception, social strategy
* Execution: Communication under time pressure

**Synchronous multiplayer adds load:**

* Must coordinate in real-time
* Social pressure (others waiting)
* Communication bandwidth limitations

**Asynchronous multiplayer reduces load:**

* Can think at own pace
* No coordination pressure
* Social interaction deferred

**Cooperative games: Coordination load**

* Example: Deep Rock Galactic—must track teammates' ammo, health, positions
* Example: Overcooked—must coordinate tasks, communication under time pressure

**Competitive games: Deception and prediction load**

* Example: Among Us—must track social information, detect lies, manage reputation
* Example: Poker—must read opponents, hide information, evaluate bluffs

**The social multiplier:** Social features typically add 20-40% to total cognitive load.

* If your core game already uses 80% of casual budget, you can't add synchronous multiplayer
* If targeting Fellowship aesthetic, must budget for social load from the start

**Design test:** Can players coordinate without voice chat? If communication requirements exceed what text/pings allow, you're demanding too much from social source.

### Budget Allocation by Aesthetic

Different aesthetics require different allocations:

**Challenge aesthetic: Heavy on core mechanic execution**

* 60% core mechanic (execution or decision)
* 20% resource management (scarcity creates challenge)
* 10% goal tracking
* 10% context

**Mastery aesthetic: Heavy on core mechanic complexity + meta-systems**

* 40% core mechanic (deep interactions)
* 30% resource management (optimization space)
* 10% goal tracking
* 20% context/meta-progression (long-term mastery)

**Discovery aesthetic: Heavy on context + goal tracking**

* 40% core mechanic (exploration mechanics)
* 10% resource management (not the point)
* 20% goal tracking (what's left to find?)
* 30% context (world richness)

**Submission aesthetic: Heavy on core mechanic, minimal everything else**

* 70% core mechanic (the relaxing activity itself)
* 10% resource management (abundance, not scarcity)
* 10% goal tracking (clear, simple objectives)
* 10% context (simple framing)

**Fellowship aesthetic: Balanced, with social load**

* 40% core mechanic
* 10% resource management
* 10% goal tracking
* 10% context
* 30% social/communication

**These are guidelines, not rules.** But they show how aesthetic goals determine where you should allocate cognitive budget.

**Design process:**

1. Identify total budget (casual/midcore/hardcore)
2. Allocate by aesthetic priorities
3. If allocation exceeds budget, cut or simplify lowest-priority sources
4. Validate through playtesting (do players feel overwhelmed or bored?)

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Budget allocation framework is working hypothesis based on game analysis. Specific percentages require validation, but principle of strategic allocation is sound.

## Archetype-Specific Load Profiles

From Chapter 2: Archetypes are structural patterns that determine game mechanics. Different archetypes create different cognitive load profiles—and serve different aesthetics naturally.

**The critical insight:** Some archetype-aesthetic combinations create load mismatches. You can't force Investigation archetype to work for Submission aesthetic—the archetype structurally requires tracking load that contradicts Submission's needs.

### The Load Profile Matrix

| Archetype             | Tracking  | Decision  | Execution | Total     | Primary Aesthetics Served       | Notes                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Investigation**     | High      | Medium    | Low       | High      | Discovery, Mastery              | Evidence tracking heavy, execution not required            |
| **Tactical Combat**   | Medium    | High      | Low       | High      | Challenge, Mastery              | Position/option evaluation, turn-based so execution low    |
| **Real-time Action**  | Low       | Low       | High      | Medium    | Challenge, Tension              | Reflex-focused, no time for complex tracking               |
| **4X Strategy**       | Very High | Very High | Low       | Very High | Mastery, Progression            | Many interconnected systems, turn-based                    |
| **Puzzle**            | Low       | Very High | Low       | Medium    | Challenge                       | Pure problem-solving, minimal state                        |
| **Cozy Simulation**   | Low       | Low       | Low       | Low       | Submission, Expression          | Minimal stress across all dimensions                       |
| **Roguelike**         | Medium    | High      | Medium    | High      | Challenge, Mastery, Progression | Build decisions + execution, meta-progression              |
| **Horror Survival**   | Medium    | Medium    | Medium    | Medium    | Tension, Challenge              | Balanced load creates sustained dread                      |
| **Walking Simulator** | Low       | Low       | Low       | Low       | Narrative, Discovery            | Environmental storytelling, no mechanical load             |
| **Social Deduction**  | Medium    | Very High | Low       | High      | Fellowship, Competition         | Social information tracking, deception detection           |
| **MOBA**              | High      | High      | Very High | Very High | Competition, Mastery            | Simultaneous tracking + decision + execution               |
| **Metroidvania**      | Medium    | Medium    | Medium    | Medium    | Discovery, Progression          | Spatial memory, combat skill, ability-gating               |
| **Survival**          | High      | Medium    | Medium    | High      | Challenge, Tension              | Resource scarcity, crafting complexity                     |
| **Heist Planning**    | Medium    | Very High | Low       | High      | Challenge, Fellowship           | Planning phase high decision, execution phase high tension |

**How to use this matrix:**

1. Choose archetype (Chapter 2) based on aesthetic goals
2. Check load profile—does it match your target audience capacity?
3. If mismatch: Either choose different archetype or different audience
4. Design within archetype's natural load profile

### Investigation Archetype: High Tracking, Medium Decision

**Why high tracking:** Core mechanic is gathering and connecting evidence. Must remember clues, suspects, timeline, relationships.

**Why medium decision:** Deduction requires evaluation but often has clear logic once you have information.

**Why low execution:** Turn-based or pauseable, no reflex requirements.

**Total load: High**—appropriate for midcore to hardcore audiences seeking Discovery or Mastery.

**Example: Return of the Obra Dinn**

* Tracking: 60 crew members, causes of death, relationships, timeline
* Decision: Deduction logic—"this person must be X because Y"
* Execution: None—point and click, unlimited time
* Perfect example of Investigation profile serving Discovery aesthetic

**Example: Disco Elysium**

* Tracking: Political factions, relationship states, case details, internal voices
* Decision: Dialogue choices, skill checks, investigation paths
* Execution: None—pure narrative and investigation
* Investigation + Narrative aesthetics, high tracking serves worldbuilding

**Can't reduce tracking without breaking archetype:**

* If you externalize all clues, deduction becomes trivial
* Tracking load IS the challenge—removing it removes the game

**Design implications:**

* Must provide support (journals, clue boards, notes)
* Can't serve casual audience (tracking load too high)
* Can't serve Submission aesthetic (mental effort contradicts relaxation)

### Tactical Combat Archetype: Medium Tracking, High Decision

**Why medium tracking:** Must monitor unit positions, abilities, cooldowns, terrain. But turn-based allows checking between decisions.

**Why high decision:** Core mechanic is evaluating tactical options. Action economy, positioning, ability synergies create complex decision space.

**Why low execution:** Turn-based, unlimited time to execute choices.

**Total load: High**—appropriate for midcore to hardcore audiences seeking Challenge or Mastery.

**Example: XCOM 2**

* Tracking: Squad positions, enemy types, mission timer, cover positions
* Decision: Move or shoot? Which target? Use ability? Position for next turn?
* Execution: None—turn-based
* Tactical profile serving Challenge aesthetic perfectly

**Example: Into the Breach**

* Tracking: Minimal (3 units, small grid, clear threat indicators)
* Decision: Very high (puzzle-like evaluation of moves)
* Execution: None
* Intentionally reduced tracking to increase decision load accessibility

**Can increase or decrease decision load:**

* More abilities, larger maps → higher decision load
* Fewer abilities, smaller maps → lower decision load
* But maintaining "tactical" requires meaningful positioning decisions

**Design implications:**

* Decision load is the aesthetic payoff
* Can scale to audience by adjusting action space size
* Can't reduce decision load too much without losing tactical nature

### Real-time Action Archetype: Low Tracking, Low Decision, High Execution

**Why low tracking:** Real-time pressure means you can't monitor complex state. Information must be instantly readable.

**Why low decision:** Must decide quickly—complex evaluation impossible under time pressure.

**Why high execution:** Core mechanic is performing actions correctly under pressure. Timing, precision, reflexes.

**Total load: Medium**—execution load is cognitively distinct from tracking/decision, allows some audience accessibility despite challenge.

**Example: DOOM (2016)**

* Tracking: Health, armor, ammo (3 values, huge UI elements)
* Decision: Shoot demons, dodge attacks, pick up resources (simple priorities)
* Execution: Aiming, movement, target prioritization under time pressure
* Real-time profile serving Challenge aesthetic through execution not complexity

**Example: Celeste**

* Tracking: Your position, next platform (minimal)
* Decision: Which movement technique? (limited set)
* Execution: Precise platforming timing
* Pure execution challenge, intentionally minimal tracking/decision

**Cannot add complexity without breaking archetype:**

* Complex resources → tracking load exceeds real-time capacity
* Complex decision trees → analysis paralysis under pressure
* The speed IS the point—adding complexity removes speed

**Design implications:**

* Must minimize tracking (clear UI, simple resources)
* Must minimize decisions (obvious priorities, muscle memory)
* Execution load serves Challenge aesthetic directly
* Accessible to players with good reflexes regardless of system mastery capacity

### 4X Strategy Archetype: Very High Tracking, Very High Decision

**Why very high tracking:** Empire management across multiple cities/planets/systems. Tech trees, diplomatic relationships, military compositions, resource economies.

**Why very high decision:** Every action has opportunity cost. Build A or B? Expand or consolidate? War or peace? Decisions cascade across turns.

**Why low execution:** Turn-based, unlimited time. Some real-time variants exist but slower-paced.

**Total load: Very High**—only appropriate for hardcore audiences seeking Mastery aesthetic.

**Example: Civilization VI**

* Tracking: 10+ cities, 20+ resources, diplomatic states, tech progress, unit positions
* Decision: Every build, every policy, every war—hundreds per session
* Execution: None—turn-based
* Very high load justified for hardcore strategy audience

**Example: Stellaris**

* Tracking: Dozens of planets, species, factions, technologies, fleets
* Decision: Empire strategy, diplomacy, wars, resource allocation
* Execution: Pauseable real-time (effectively turn-based thinking)
* Mastery aesthetic requires this complexity—simplifying would remove the game

**Cannot serve casual audience:**

* Too many systems to track
* Too many decisions to evaluate
* Requires sustained sessions (3+ hours)

**Design implications:**

* Target hardcore only
* Provide extensive UI support (tooltips, graphs, filters)
* Accept that complexity is feature not bug
* Meta-progression often minimal (game itself is the depth)

### Cozy Simulation Archetype: Low Everything

**Why low tracking:** Abundance, not scarcity. Minimal resources, simple state.

**Why low decision:** No wrong choices, forgiving consequences, self-expression focus.

**Why low execution:** Gentle pacing, no time pressure, accessible controls.

**Total load: Low**—serves casual audience seeking Submission or Expression.

**Example: Animal Crossing: New Horizons**

* Tracking: Some resources (bells, miles) but abundant
* Decision: What to catch, what to craft (all positive, no wrong answers)
* Execution: Simple button presses, gentle timing
* Minimal load serves relaxation perfectly

**Example: Unpacking**

* Tracking: None (just items to place)
* Decision: Where to put things (aesthetic choice, no optimization)
* Execution: Click and drag
* Pure Expression aesthetic with minimal load

**Example: Stardew Valley**

* Tracking: Energy, time of day, relationships (moderate for cozy genre)
* Decision: What to plant, who to befriend (forgiving, self-paced)
* Execution: Simple controls
* Slightly higher load but still serves Submission through gentle rhythms

**Must maintain low load to serve aesthetic:**

* Adding scarcity creates stress (contradicts Submission)
* Adding complex decisions creates pressure (contradicts relaxation)
* Adding execution requirements creates tension (contradicts calm)

**Design implications:**

* Abundance over scarcity
* Positive choices (not optimization under constraints)
* Gentle pacing with player control
* Self-expression valued over efficiency

### Roguelike Archetype: Medium Tracking, High Decision, Medium Execution

**Why medium tracking:** Must monitor build composition, current resources, enemy patterns. But each run is fresh start—no persistent state overwhelm.

**Why high decision:** Build choices, risk/reward paths, resource allocation. Optimization under uncertainty.

**Why medium execution:** Often requires mechanical skill but not esports-level reflexes.

**Total load: High**—serves midcore to hardcore seeking Challenge + Mastery + Progression.

**Example: Slay the Spire**

* Tracking: Deck composition (\~20 cards), relics (\~10), enemy intents, HP, energy
* Decision: Card draft, path choice, card play order (high optimization space)
* Execution: None (turn-based)
* High decision load creates Mastery, meta-progression creates Progression

**Example: Hades**

* Tracking: Boon build, enemy patterns, room rewards
* Decision: Boon choices, path selection, upgrade priorities
* Execution: Combat requires skill but forgiving timing
* Balanced load serves midcore audience

**Example: The Binding of Isaac**

* Tracking: Item effects (\~700 items with interactions)
* Decision: Item synergies, room priority, resource management
* Execution: Twin-stick shooting (moderate skill)
* Very high total load serves hardcore audience

**Archetype allows load scaling:**

* Simpler roguelikes (less items, clearer effects) serve midcore
* Complex roguelikes (hundreds of items, obscure interactions) serve hardcore
* Meta-progression can offset run difficulty (investment over time reduces per-run load)

**Design implications:**

* Meta-progression essential (provides long-term goals, load reduction over time)
* Short runs respect session time (20-60 minutes)
* Fresh start each run reduces persistent tracking load
* Build variety creates replayability

### Horror Survival Archetype: Medium Everything

**Why medium tracking:** Must monitor scarce resources, environment state, threat positions. Not overwhelming, but present pressure.

**Why medium decision:** Resource management under scarcity, risk/reward choices, but pressure limits analysis time.

**Why medium execution:** Some combat or evasion skill required, but not action-game precision.

**Total load: Medium**—balanced load creates sustained tension. Serves Tension aesthetic for midcore audience.

**Example: Resident Evil 2 Remake**

* Tracking: Ammunition, healing items, key items, enemy positions, save ribbons
* Decision: Fight or flee? Use resources now or save? Explore or progress?
* Execution: Aiming, dodging, but forgiving (not punishing precision)
* Balanced load creates sustained dread

**Example: Alien: Isolation**

* Tracking: Resources, tools, Alien position (approximate), objective locations
* Decision: When to hide, when to move, when to use items
* Execution: Stealth movement, timed interactions
* Medium load serves Tension without overwhelming

**Cannot reduce load too much:**

* Abundant resources remove dread (becomes action game)
* Too-simple decisions remove tension
* Too-easy execution removes fear of failure

**Cannot increase load too much:**

* Too-scarce resources create frustration
* Too-complex systems distract from horror
* Too-difficult execution becomes action challenge not horror

**Design implications:**

* Balanced load creates sustained tension
* Resources scarce enough for pressure, not so scarce as to block progress
* Execution challenging enough to create fear, forgiving enough to be fair
* Serves midcore audience (casual lacks capacity, hardcore wants more challenge)

### When Archetype and Aesthetic Mismatch

**Some combinations don't work:**

**Investigation + Submission:**

* Investigation requires high tracking → mental effort
* Submission requires low load → relaxation
* CONFLICT: Cannot reduce tracking without losing investigation nature
* Solution: Choose different archetype or different aesthetic

**4X Strategy + Casual audience:**

* 4X requires very high tracking/decision → sustained sessions, system mastery
* Casual has low capacity → short sessions, minimal complexity
* CONFLICT: Cannot simplify 4X enough without removing the strategy
* Solution: Don't target casual with 4X (serve midcore/hardcore instead)

**Real-time Action + High tracking load:**

* Action requires focus on execution → no capacity for complex state monitoring
* If you add complex resources, players can't track them while executing
* CONFLICT: Simultaneity prevents tracking complex state
* Solution: Minimize resources, automate tracking, or slow down execution

**The test:** Does your archetype's natural load profile match:

1. Your aesthetic goals? (Does the load create the intended experience?)
2. Your target audience capacity? (Can they handle this load?)

If no to either, reconsider archetype choice.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH for established archetypes (Investigation, Tactical, Action, 4X, Cozy). MEDIUM for emerging archetypes (may require refinement as genre evolves).

## Load Reduction Strategies

You've identified appropriate load for your aesthetic and audience. Now: how do you manage that load so players can actually engage with your game?

**The goal:** Maintain necessary load (serves aesthetic) while removing unnecessary load (pure friction).

**Five primary strategies:**

### Strategy 1: Automation

**What it is:** System handles calculations, tracking, or execution automatically.

**Reduces:** Primarily tracking load and execution load. Sometimes decision load (removes choice, which may or may not be desirable).

**When to use:**

* Bookkeeping that doesn't create decisions (automatically calculate attack damage, don't make players do math)
* State tracking that's always the same (auto-save, auto-track quest progress)
* Execution tasks that aren't part of aesthetic (auto-reload in shooter if reloading isn't strategic)

**Examples:**

**Video games excel at automation:**

* Health bars update automatically (don't manually track HP)
* Resources auto-count (don't manually add gold)
* Map reveals as explored (don't draw your own map)
* Calculations happen instantly (damage, probabilities, resource costs)

**This is why video games can support more complexity:**

* XCOM: Game calculates hit %, flanking bonuses, cover values instantly
* Without automation, players would need calculators and spreadsheets
* Automation doesn't remove strategic depth—removes mathematical busywork

**TTRPGs can automate less but still some:**

* Character sheet tracks totals (don't recalculate HP max every session)
* Initiative order written down (don't remember ordering)
* Spell cards list effects (don't memorize every spell)

**Board games limited but possible:**

* Apps for setup, scoring, state tracking
* Reference cards reduce memorization
* Player aids automate lookups

**Trade-offs:**

* **Pros:** Reduces load, increases speed, prevents errors
* **Cons:** Can remove strategic depth if automating meaningful choices, reduces player agency
* **Example of too much:** Vampire Survivors automates combat entirely—works for Submission aesthetic, would ruin Challenge aesthetic

**Design test:** Is this automation removing busywork (good) or removing meaningful engagement (bad)?

**LLM integration opportunity:**

* LLMs can automate narrative generation, NPC dialogue, quest generation
* Reduces GM/designer load for content creation
* But can't reliably automate rules adjudication or balance calculations (hallucination risk)
* Best for: Creative content that doesn't require mathematical precision
* Worst for: Rules enforcement, numerical balance, strategic calculations
* Confidence: MEDIUM—LLM capabilities evolving rapidly

### Strategy 2: Chunking

**What it is:** Group related information together so players treat it as single unit rather than many separate pieces.

**Reduces:** Primarily tracking load. Leverages human working memory's natural chunking ability.

**When to use:**

* Multiple related resources that always move together
* Status effects that share category
* Information that logically groups

**Examples:**

**Resource chunking:**

* Instead of: Iron ore, copper ore, tin ore, gold ore, silver ore (5 trackables)
* Use: Metal (1 trackable, varieties are subcategories)
* Example: Many survival games—"Food" instead of apple, bread, meat, fish

**UI chunking:**

* Group related information visually
* Hades: Boons grouped by god (Zeus, Athena, Ares)
* Without chunking: Random mixed list of 20+ boon effects
* With chunking: 5 god categories, 4 boons each = easier to scan

**Status effect chunking:**

* Instead of: Burning, Freezing, Shocking, Bleeding, Poisoned (5 separate DoTs)
* Use: Elemental Status (fire/ice/lightning) and Physical Status (bleed/poison)
* Reduces cognitive categories from 5 to 2

**Mechanical chunking:**

* Fighting games: Combo notation (quarter-circle-forward + punch = one chunk)
* Without chunking: Down, down-forward, forward, weak punch (4 separate inputs)
* With chunking: "QCF-P" (1 mental unit after learning)

**Trade-offs:**

* **Pros:** Reduces trackables without removing depth
* **Cons:** Can oversimplify if chunks hide important differences
* **Example of too much:** All damage types feel the same (fire/ice/lightning are cosmetic not mechanical)

**Design test:** Do players naturally treat these items as related, or are you forcing artificial grouping?

### Strategy 3: Progressive Disclosure

**What it is:** Reveal complexity gradually as players develop capacity to handle it.

**Reduces:** Initial load. Total load stays same but spread across time.

**When to use:**

* Complex systems that can be learned incrementally
* Games with long learning curves
* When targeting mixed skill audiences (optional depth for experts)

**Examples:**

**Tutorial progression:**

* Portal: Introduces one mechanic per test chamber
* Chamber 1: Portal gun (blue only)
* Chamber 2: Orange portal
* Chamber 3: Momentum conservation
* Chamber 10: Combining everything
* Never overwhelming, always building on previous learning

**System gating:**

* Hades: Unlocks weapons, boons, NPCs, meta-systems gradually
* First run: Basic attack, dash, cast (3 abilities)
* Later runs: More boons, weapon aspects, keepsakes, relationships
* Complexity revealed as players develop capacity

**Optional depth:**

* Celeste: Core game accessible, B-sides for experts
* Casual players: Complete main story (moderate challenge)
* Hardcore players: Optional ultra-hard content (extreme challenge)
* Same game serves multiple audiences through optional complexity

**Ability unlocks:**

* Metroidvanias: New abilities reveal new areas
* Early game: Limited moveset (low execution load)
* Late game: Many movement options (high execution load)
* Players have developed skill gradually

**Trade-offs:**

* **Pros:** Reduces initial overwhelming, natural learning curve
* **Cons:** Can hide depth (players don't know what they're missing), slow burn doesn't work for all audiences
* **Example of too much:** Final Fantasy XIII—20+ hour tutorial

**Design test:** Are players ready for the next complexity reveal, or are you dumping it too fast?

### Strategy 4: Offloading

**What it is:** Allow external tools to handle tracking or calculation.

**Reduces:** Tracking load and decision load (by externalizing state).

**When to use:**

* Complex games targeting hardcore audience that expects tools
* Information too detailed to track in-game UI
* Calculations too complex for mental math

**Examples:**

**Community tools:**

* Path of Exile: Trade sites, build planners, damage calculators
* Game intentionally complex—community tools handle overflow
* Not ideal design, but pragmatic for Mastery aesthetic requiring extreme depth

**Official tools:**

* D\&D Beyond: Digital character sheets, spell lookup, rules reference
* Offloads memorization and calculation from players and GMs
* Enables more complex gameplay without overwhelming

**Note-taking:**

* Outer Wilds: Players keep notes on mysteries
* Game doesn't track all details—players externalize
* This is intentional—deduction is the aesthetic, external notes are tool

**Physical aids:**

* Board games: Reference cards, player aids, apps
* Gloomhaven: Campaign tracker app (remembers state between sessions)
* Offloads persistent state tracking

**Trade-offs:**

* **Pros:** Allows more complexity than pure in-game UI supports
* **Cons:** Breaks immersion, creates dependency, not all players will use tools (creates skill gap)
* **Example of too much:** Game requiring spreadsheets for basic play (too complex even for hardcore)

**Design test:** Are you requiring tools because you failed to simplify, or because your target audience expects and wants this depth?

**Acceptable offloading:**

* Hardcore Mastery games (Path of Exile, Dwarf Fortress)
* Complex RPGs (D\&D, Pathfinder)
* Long campaigns (note-taking between sessions)

**Unacceptable offloading:**

* Casual games requiring external tools (wrong audience)
* Core gameplay broken without tools (design failure)
* Tools needed because UI bad (fix UI instead)

### Strategy 5: Simplification

**What it is:** Remove complexity entirely. Fewer resources, fewer mechanics, fewer choices.

**Reduces:** All load types. Also reduces depth.

**When to use:**

* Feature doesn't serve aesthetic (cut it)
* Cognitive budget exceeded (must reduce somewhere)
* Targeting casual audience (need low total load)

**This is the hardest strategy:** Requires killing your darlings.

**Examples:**

**Ruthless feature cutting:**

* Into the Breach: 3 units, \~8 enemy types, small grids
* Could have been: 10 units, 30 enemy types, huge maps (like Fire Emblem)
* Chose simplicity to maximize decision quality per unit complexity
* Result: Perfect information puzzle-tactics, not overwhelming

**Resource reduction:**

* Many indie games: Health only (no mana, stamina, hunger, thirst)
* Could have been: Survival game with 12 resources
* Chose simplicity to focus on core aesthetic (combat or exploration)
* Result: Players engage with core, not resource juggling

**Mechanic consolidation:**

* Hades: Each weapon has \~4 abilities (attack, special, cast, dash)
* Could have been: 20 abilities per weapon
* Chose simplicity for accessibility
* Result: Easy to learn, hard to master through execution not memorization

**Choice reduction:**

* Slay the Spire: Choose 1 of 3 cards per reward
* Could have been: Choose from 10+ cards
* Chose simplicity to keep decision quality high
* Result: Every choice meaningful, not overwhelming

**Trade-offs:**

* **Pros:** Reduces load, increases accessibility, forces focus on what matters
* **Cons:** Reduces depth, may disappoint hardcore players expecting complexity
* **Example of too much:** Over-simplification removes strategic depth (all choices equivalent = no meaningful choices)

**Design test:** Does removing this feature reduce aesthetic payoff? If yes, keep it. If no, cut it.

**The test for simplification:**

Before cutting, ask:

1. **Does this serve my primary aesthetic?** If no → cut
2. **Does this create proportional payoff for its load cost?** If no → cut or simplify
3. **Would casual players use this feature?** If targeting casual and answer is no → cut
4. **Is this creating depth or just complexity?** Depth = meaningful choices. Complexity = choices without impact → cut complexity, keep depth

**Example: The 3-5 resource guideline from Chapter 3**

Why this limit? Cognitive load constraint.

* Casual players: Can track 3 resources comfortably
* Midcore players: Can track 5 resources
* Hardcore players: Can track 7+ resources
* Beyond this, need external tools or accept some players will ignore some resources

**If you have 8 resources and target midcore:**

* Option A: Simplify—combine resources (chunking)
* Option B: Offload—provide tools to track (offloading)
* Option C: Cut—remove least important 3 resources (simplification)
* Option D: Accept—some players will ignore some resources (intentional overwhelming for Mastery aesthetic)

**Choose based on aesthetic and audience.**

### Combining Strategies

**Real games use multiple strategies simultaneously:**

**Hades example:**

* **Automation:** Damage calculated instantly, builds tracked automatically
* **Chunking:** Boons grouped by god, similar effects clustered
* **Progressive disclosure:** Weapons, aspects, keepsakes unlocked gradually
* **Simplification:** 4 core abilities, limited boon slots, focused design
* Result: Medium complexity game accessible to midcore audience

**XCOM 2 example:**

* **Automation:** Hit chances calculated and displayed instantly, line of sight shown
* **Chunking:** Soldiers grouped by class, abilities organized by tier
* **Progressive disclosure:** New enemies introduced gradually, abilities unlock over campaign
* **Offloading:** Community tools for build planning (optional)
* Result: High complexity tactical game for midcore to hardcore

**Path of Exile example:**

* **Automation:** Damage calculated by game engine (players don't do math)
* **Chunking:** Skills grouped by type, items by slot
* **Offloading:** Community tools REQUIRED (trade, builds, calculators)
* **Simplification:** None—intentionally maximizes complexity
* Result: Very high complexity for hardcore Mastery audience

**Design process:**

1. Identify cognitive budget (audience capacity)
2. Allocate by sources (core mechanic, resources, goals, context)
3. For each source exceeding budget:
   * Can we automate busywork? (removes friction)
   * Can we chunk information? (reduces trackables)
   * Can we reveal gradually? (spreads load across time)
   * Can we offload to tools? (enables more depth for hardcore)
   * Can we cut features? (reduces total load)
4. Validate through playtesting

**The goal:** Optimize investment-to-payoff ratio. Maximum aesthetic payoff for available cognitive investment.

**Confidence Level:** HIGH for individual strategies (all validated across game design history). MEDIUM for combining strategies optimally (requires case-by-case design judgment).

## Load Across Loop Scales

From Chapter 1: Games operate at multiple loop scales (micro, meso, macro, meta). From Chapter 6 (forward reference): Temporal architecture structures these loops. Here: How cognitive load changes across scales.

**The key insight:** Different loop scales demand different load types and create different challenges for players.

### Micro Loops: Execution Load Primary

**Duration:** Seconds to minutes (1 action to \~5 minutes)

**Load profile:**

* **Execution load dominant** (timing, precision, coordination)
* **Tracking load minimal** (instant state visibility required)
* **Decision load low** (must decide quickly, pattern recognition not analysis)

**Why:** Micro loops repeat hundreds of times per session. High tracking or decision load would slow flow to unplayable.

**Examples:**

**Vampire Survivors—micro loop only:**

* Duration: Continuous (no discrete loops)
* Execution: Movement (WASD)
* Tracking: Health, XP bar (both huge UI elements)
* Decision: Where to move (pure spatial)
* Total load: Very low, all execution/spatial

**DOOM (2016)—micro loop emphasized:**

* Duration: 5-30 seconds per encounter
* Execution: Aiming, movement, glory kills
* Tracking: Health, armor, ammo (3 values, always visible)
* Decision: Which demon to shoot (priority obvious)
* Total load: Medium, mostly execution

**Design implications for micro loops:**

* **Instant feedback required** (did my action work?)
* **Clear state visibility** (health/resources big and obvious)
* **Minimize decision complexity** (pattern recognition, not analysis)
* **Fast adjudication** (can't wait 2 seconds for resolution)

**Micro loop failures:**

**Red Dead Redemption 2 looting:**

* Micro action: Pick up item
* Execution: Hold button for 3 seconds watching animation
* Problem: Adjudication too slow (hundreds of looting actions = minutes of watching)
* Result: Micro loop frustration

**Complex status effects in action games:**

* Problem: Can't read 5 debuff descriptions while dodging attacks
* Solution: Simple status effects (on fire = taking damage, that's it)

### Meso Loops: Decision Load Primary

**Duration:** Minutes to half hour (one task to one session segment)

**Load profile:**

* **Decision load dominant** (evaluating tactical/strategic choices)
* **Tracking load moderate** (can check UI between decisions)
* **Execution load varies** (depends on micro loop demands)

**Why:** Meso loops are where goals exist and progress happens. "Complete this dungeon" "Win this match" "Finish this quest." Decisions here determine success.

**Examples:**

**Slay the Spire—meso loop is the run:**

* Duration: 20-45 minutes per run
* Decision: Card draft, path choice, shop purchases, card play tactics
* Tracking: Deck composition, relics, current HP, gold
* Execution: None (turn-based)
* Total load: Medium-high, mostly decision

**Hades—meso loop is the escape attempt:**

* Duration: 20-35 minutes per run
* Decision: Boon choices, path selection, chamber rewards
* Tracking: Build composition, enemy patterns, resources
* Execution: Combat (moderate)
* Total load: Medium, balanced decision + execution

**Design implications for meso loops:**

* **Goal clarity essential** ("what am I trying to accomplish this run/quest/match?")
* **Progress visibility** (10/15 rooms cleared, 3/5 objectives)
* **Stopping points optional** (can pause mid-meso if needed)
* **Completion satisfying** (clear win/loss, achievement feeling)

**Meso loop failures:**

**Early No Man's Sky:**

* Problem: No clear meso goal beyond "survive"
* Players landed on planet → gathered resources → ??? → next planet
* No sense of progress or completion
* Fix: Added clear meso goals (specific missions, base building objectives)

**Battle royale without mid-game:**

* Problem: Looting phase (first 10 min) then nothing until final circle
* Meso goal unclear between early and late game
* Some games fix with objective markers, circle timers, loot quality tiers

### Macro Loops: Tracking Load Primary

**Duration:** Session to run (30 minutes to multiple hours, may span sessions)

**Load profile:**

* **Tracking load dominant** (long-term state, campaign progress, persistent world)
* **Decision load moderate** (strategic planning, but decisions spaced out)
* **Execution load varies** (depends on micro loops)

**Why:** Macro loops persist across time. Players must remember what they're doing, where they are in campaign, what long-term goals matter.

**Examples:**

**XCOM 2—macro loop is the campaign:**

* Duration: 20-40 hours across multiple sessions
* Tracking: Squad roster, research progress, facility building, Avatar Project timer, regional coverage
* Decision: Strategic layer (what to research, where to expand, resource allocation)
* Execution: Tactical missions (micro + meso loops)
* Total load: High, tracking complicated by session gaps

**Civilization VI—macro loop is the game:**

* Duration: 6-20 hours, usually multiple sessions
* Tracking: Empire state (cities, units, diplomacy, tech, culture), victory progress
* Decision: Every turn has strategic implications
* Execution: None (turn-based)
* Total load: Very high, mostly tracking + decision

**Design implications for macro loops:**

* **State persistence critical** (save systems, cloud saves)
* **Resumption support** (journals, recaps, "what was I doing?")
* **Long-term goals visible** (campaign progress, victory conditions)
* **Stopping points designed** (natural session boundaries)

**Macro loop failures:**

**No session recaps:**

* Problem: Players return after 1 week, forget complex state
* Must spend 10 minutes re-orienting (high resumption load)
* Solution: "Previously on..." recaps, journals with context

**Poor save systems:**

* Anthem: Lost progress on disconnects
* Problem: Players afraid to invest time (macro progress at risk)
* Trust destroyed by state persistence failures

**Unclear long-term goals:**

* Problem: Players complete meso loops but don't know why
* "I finished this dungeon, but why? What's the campaign goal?"
* Solution: Visible progress toward macro objective

### Meta Loops: Memory Load Between Sessions

**Duration:** Between sessions, weeks to months, potentially infinite

**Load profile:**

* **Memory load dominant** (what unlocks do I have? what was I working toward?)
* **Tracking load moderate** (persistent account state)
* **Decision load low** (meta decisions infrequent)
* **Execution load none** (meta happens outside play)

**Why:** Meta loops persist across time gaps. Players must remember meta systems, what they're working toward, what's changed since last play.

**Examples:**

**Hades—meta loop is the full narrative:**

* Duration: 50-100 runs, 30-60 hours, multiple weeks/months
* Memory: Which NPCs have story progress, which weapons/aspects unlocked, mirror talents, keepsakes
* Tracking: Relationship levels, prophecy progress, codex completion
* Decision: Keepsake choice, mirror talent allocation, weapon aspect unlocks
* Total load: Medium, but spread across time

**Destiny 2—meta loop is seasonal:**

* Duration: 3 months per season
* Memory: Seasonal mods, artifact unlocks, quest progress, power level
* Tracking: Multiple currencies, seasonal challenges, triumphs
* Decision: Build crafting, mod selection, activity priorities
* Total load: High, complicated by FOMO (time-limited content)

**Design implications for meta loops:**

* **Persistence required** (cloud saves, account systems)
* **Return clarity** ("what's new? what was I working on?")
* **Optional depth** (can ignore meta and still play, or engage deeply)
* **No FOMO** (can return after months without punishment)

**Meta loop failures:**

**Live service FOMO:**

* Problem: Daily quests, limited-time events, battle passes
* Players feel *obligated* to play (extrinsic motivation)
* Taking break means falling behind (punishment for absence)
* Solution: Permanent content, intrinsic motivation, no time gates

**Over-complex meta systems:**

* Problem: 5+ currencies, 3+ progression systems, seasonal resets
* Returning players overwhelmed (too much changed)
* Solution: Consolidate currencies, permanent core progression

**No resumption support:**

* Problem: Return after 2 months, forget everything
* Meta systems opaque (what do these currencies do?)
* Solution: Tutorial refreshers, clear goal reminders, simplified UI

### Investment Trajectories: Load Changes Over Time

**From Chapter 1 reference:** Players develop capacity as they play. Cognitive load that's overwhelming initially becomes manageable with practice.

**The pattern:**

**Novice phase (first hours):**

* High cognitive load (learning mechanics, building mental model)
* Low capacity (no automation through practice)
* Need: Clear tutorials, progressive disclosure, low initial complexity

**Intermediate phase (first weeks):**

* Medium cognitive load (core mechanics internalized)
* Growing capacity (pattern recognition developing)
* Need: New challenges, skill progression, optional complexity reveals

**Expert phase (50+ hours):**

* Low cognitive load from familiar systems (automation through mastery)
* High capacity (can handle complex interactions)
* Need: Deep optimization, meta-systems, high-skill challenges

**Mastery phase (hundreds of hours):**

* Very low cognitive load from core mechanics (fully automated)
* Very high capacity (seeking new complexity)
* Need: Endless depth, community challenges, self-imposed difficulty

**Design implications:**

**For Challenge aesthetic:**

* Early game teaches mechanics
* Mid game provides mastery curve
* Late game challenges expert execution
* Endgame provides extreme optional challenges

**For Mastery aesthetic:**

* Early game introduces systems gradually
* Mid game reveals complexity (progressive disclosure)
* Late game optimization space opens up
* Endgame is endless depth (theorycrafting, build variety)

**For Submission aesthetic:**

* Early game immediately accessible
* Complexity stays flat (no overwhelming later)
* Mastery reduces load further (automation through practice)
* Endgame is zen-like flow (minimal conscious thought)

**Examples:**

**Celeste trajectory (Challenge):**

* Chapter 1: Learn basic movement (low execution load)
* Chapter 3: Combine techniques (medium execution load)
* Chapter 7-8: Complex sequences (high execution load)
* B-sides: Expert challenges (very high execution load)
* C-sides: Frame-perfect platforming (extreme execution load)
* Players develop execution capacity across trajectory

**Path of Exile trajectory (Mastery):**

* Acts 1-3: Basic skills and links (low decision load)
* Acts 4-10: Build foundation (medium decision load)
* Maps: Build optimization (high decision load)
* Endgame: Min-maxing, theorycrafting (very high decision load)
* Players develop system mastery across trajectory

**Animal Crossing trajectory (Submission):**

* Day 1: Learn mechanics (low load)
* Week 1: Daily routine (very low load, automated)
* Month 1: Zen daily ritual (minimal conscious load)
* Year 1: Pure flow state (muscle memory)
* Load *decreases* over time as routines automate

**The stopping point challenge:**

**Macro loops must account for memory decay:**

* Player stops mid-campaign, returns 1 week later
* Has forgotten complex state
* Needs: Journals, recaps, clear markers of where they were

**Meta loops must account for long gaps:**

* Player returns after 3 months
* Has forgotten meta systems
* Needs: Tutorial refreshers, goal clarity, systems explanations

**From Chapter 6 (forward reference):** Stopping point design provides session boundaries where players can safely stop without losing context. Good stopping points reduce resumption load.

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH for loop-scale load patterns (validated through game analysis), MEDIUM for investment trajectories (pattern observed but individual variation high).

## Integration and Validation

Cognitive load doesn't exist in isolation. It connects to every other design decision.

### How Cognitive Load Integrates With Other Chapters

**Chapter 1: System Components and Aesthetics**

Cognitive load is the **constraint within which you design components**.

* Mechanics create execution load (timing, coordination) and decision load (action selection)
* Parameters create tracking load (resource values) and decision load (spending choices)
* Context creates tracking load (world state, relationships) and memory load (returning after gaps)
* Pacing distributes load across time (recovery periods reduce sustained load)
* Configuration coherence requires all components respect same cognitive budget

**Investment profiles determine budget:**

* Casual: 3-5 load units → compressed architecture, simple mechanics
* Midcore: 5-8 load units → standard architecture, moderate complexity
* Hardcore: 8-15+ load units → expansive architecture, deep systems

**Aesthetics determine appropriate load:**

* Challenge → high execution or decision load acceptable
* Mastery → high tracking and decision load required
* Submission → low load across all dimensions required

**Chapter 2: Context (Archetype, Setting, Medium)**

Archetype determines natural load profile (Investigation = high tracking, Tactical = high decision, Action = high execution).

**You cannot violate archetype's load profile without breaking it:**

* Can't make Investigation low-tracking (removes evidence-gathering challenge)
* Can't make Tactical high-execution (turn-based nature contradicts this)
* Can't make Action high-tracking (real-time pressure prevents complex monitoring)

**Medium constrains load management strategies:**

* Video games: Can automate heavily, provide clear UI, real-time feedback
* TTRPGs: Limited automation, rely on GM, offload to character sheets
* Board games: Minimal automation, must simplify or accept calculation load
* Mobile: Screen size constrains UI, requires minimal tracking

**Setting creates contextual load:**

* Complex settings (Disco Elysium) require tracking relationships, factions, lore
* Simple settings (Mario) create minimal contextual load
* Choice of setting must match available cognitive budget after allocating to core mechanics

**Chapter 3: Resources**

Resources are **the primary source of tracking load**.

**From Chapter 3:**

* Consumables create medium tracking load (monitor quantity, decide when to use)
* Buffers create low tracking load (single value, passive monitoring)
* Accumulations create low tracking load (usually increasing)
* Composition resources create very high tracking load (interactions multiply complexity)
* Trackers create low tracking load (passive, game-tracked)

**The 3-5 resource guideline is cognitive load constraint:**

* Casual players: 3 resources maximum
* Midcore players: 5 resources comfortable
* Hardcore players: 7+ resources with tools/chunking

**Resource recovery patterns affect sustained load:**

* Fast recovery → episodic pacing, load spikes then recovers
* Slow recovery → sustained load, constant monitoring pressure
* No recovery → maximum load, every decision critical

**Chapter 5: Balance (Forward Reference)**

Balance must be **perceivable within cognitive budget**.

**If players can't evaluate balance, it doesn't matter if it's mathematically perfect.**

**Examples:**

* XCOM 2: Hit percentages displayed explicitly (balance perceivable, low decision load)
* Path of Exile: Damage calculations hidden, requires tools (balance hidden, but hardcore audience expects this)
* Fighting games: Frame data hidden, requires research (intentional complexity for competitive depth)

**Balance paradigms and cognitive load:**

* Framework balance (asymmetric): Higher tracking load (must understand different factions/classes)
* Consistency balance (symmetric): Lower tracking load (mirror matchups, same tools)
* Adaptive balance (dynamic): Medium tracking load (system adjusts, players must notice)

**Chapter 6: Temporal Architecture (Forward Reference)**

Loop architecture determines **how load distributes across time**.

**Compressed architecture (1-2 scales):**

* Casual audience, short sessions
* Low total load required
* Minimal meta-progression (reduces between-session memory load)

**Standard architecture (2-3 scales):**

* Midcore audience, variable sessions
* Medium total load
* Moderate meta-progression (some between-session tracking)

**Expansive architecture (3-4 scales):**

* Hardcore audience, long sessions
* High total load acceptable
* Extensive meta-progression (complex long-term tracking)

**Stopping points reduce resumption load:**

* Clear session boundaries (know where you stopped)
* Journals/recaps (remember what you were doing)
* Progress markers (visible advancement)

### Observable Validation: How to Test Cognitive Load

**Don't rely on self-reporting alone.** Players are bad at identifying cognitive load as the problem. They say "it's confusing" or "it's too hard" without distinguishing load issues from difficulty or clarity issues.

**Observable behaviors indicating load problems:**

### Tracking Load Too High

**Behaviors:**

* Players constantly check UI elements (glancing at resource counters repeatedly)
* Players pause frequently to count/verify state
* Players take notes during play (externalized tracking)
* Players forget important information between sessions
* Players ask "wait, what's my current X?" frequently

**Example:**

* Player in survival game keeps opening inventory to count food
* Opens every 30 seconds → tracking load too high for real-time play
* Solution: Persistent food counter on HUD, color-coded (green/yellow/red)

**How to test:**

* Video playtest sessions, count UI-checking frequency
* Normal: Glance every 1-2 minutes
* Problem: Glance every 10-30 seconds (attention consumed by tracking)

### Decision Load Too High

**Behaviors:**

* Analysis paralysis (long pauses before simple choices)
* Decision fatigue (quality of choices degrades across session)
* Players consistently choose same option (avoiding decision complexity)
* Players ask for "best build" guides (outsourcing decision-making)
* Frustration at number of options ("too many choices")

**Example:**

* Player choosing between 12 abilities for skill slot
* Sits for 5 minutes reading tooltips, comparing numbers
* Eventually picks at random or quits to research
* Solution: Reduce options to 3-5, make differences clearer, provide recommendations

**How to test:**

* Measure time-to-decision for typical choices
* Normal: \<30 seconds for tactical, \<5 minutes for strategic
* Problem: >2 minutes for tactical, >15 minutes for strategic (decision paralysis)

### Execution Load Too High

**Behaviors:**

* High error rate (failing actions that should be routine)
* Visible frustration at physical difficulty
* Avoiding certain mechanics (too hard to execute reliably)
* Success rate doesn't improve with practice (beyond player capacity)
* Players with game knowledge but poor execution quit

**Example:**

* Fighting game combo requires 1-frame link
* Player knows what to do, can't execute
* Practices for hours, still \<20% success rate
* Solution: Widen timing window or provide alternative execution method

**How to test:**

* Track success rate across sessions
* Normal: 40% session 1 → 80% session 10 (learning curve)
* Problem: 30% session 1 → 35% session 10 (not learning, too hard)

### Total Load Too High (Multiple Types)

**Behaviors:**

* Players overwhelmed, stop playing after short sessions
* "It's too much" without being able to specify what
* Quit in early game (before reaching core aesthetic)
* Successful engagement with similar games of lower complexity
* Improvement with one-on-one coaching (load barrier, not clarity)

**Example:**

* New player to 4X strategy quits after 2 hours
* "There's too much to manage, I don't know what's important"
* Tried to track: Cities, units, tech, diplomacy, resources, military, culture
* Solution: Tutorial mode with systems unlocked gradually

**How to test:**

* Session duration across player skill levels
* Normal: 30-60+ minutes before natural stopping
* Problem: \<15 minutes before overwhelm quit

### When Load Is Right

**Behaviors:**

* Players make decisions confidently within reasonable time
* Players can explain what they're tracking and why
* Improvement visible across sessions (learning curve working)
* Players achieve flow state (absorbed in play)
* "One more turn/run/match" syndrome (meso loop engaging)

**Flow state indicators:**

* Time distortion (sessions feel shorter than clock time)
* Focused attention (ignoring distractions)
* Immediate feedback loop (action → result → next action smoothly)
* Challenge-skill balance (difficult but achievable)

### Playtesting Protocol for Cognitive Load

**What to observe:**

**Session 1 (First Experience):**

* Tutorial completion rate (do they finish?)
* Time to first "got it" moment (when does core loop click?)
* Questions asked (what's unclear?)
* Errors made (what's difficult?)

**Sessions 2-5 (Learning Curve):**

* Improvement rate (are they getting better?)
* Confidence increase (fewer pauses, faster decisions)
* System mastery development (understanding interactions)
* Mistakes type (execution errors vs. knowledge errors)

**Sessions 10+ (Experienced Play):**

* Flow state achievement (absorbed play)
* Optimization behavior (seeking efficiency)
* Exploration vs. exploitation (trying new strategies vs. repeating success)
* Boredom vs. engagement (is depth sufficient?)

**What to ask (post-session):**

* "What was hardest to keep track of?"
* "Were any choices overwhelming? Which?"
* "Did you feel in control or overwhelmed?"
* "What would you change to make it easier to understand?"

**Red flags in playtesting:**

* Tutorial quit rate >30% (initial load too high)
* Plateau in skill without ceiling reached (load exceeds capacity)
* "It's too complicated" without being able to play alternative (total load issue)
* Success variance high across similar-skill players (luck-based, not skill-based → increases perceived load)

### Iteration Based on Load Problems

**If tracking load too high:**

1. Automate more (system tracks automatically)
2. Chunk better (group related trackables)
3. Simplify (remove least important trackables)
4. Improve UI (make information clearer)

**If decision load too high:**

1. Reduce options (fewer but meaningful choices)
2. Provide guidance (recommendations, default builds)
3. Chunk choices (group by category)
4. Make differences clearer (obvious trade-offs, not subtle optimization)

**If execution load too high:**

1. Widen timing windows (more forgiving)
2. Reduce coordination demands (fewer simultaneous inputs)
3. Provide execution assistance (auto-aim, smart targeting)
4. Add difficulty options (accessibility modes)

**If total load too high:**

1. Progressive disclosure (unlock systems gradually)
2. Cut features (remove entire systems)
3. Change target audience (maybe this is for hardcore, not midcore)
4. Simplify across the board (reduce everywhere)

**The validation question:** After iteration, observe behavior again. Did the changes reduce load without reducing aesthetic payoff?

**Success:** Players engage longer, achieve flow, report satisfaction, improve across sessions.

**Failure:** Load reduced but game now boring (removed necessary investment for aesthetic).

**Confidence Level:** HIGH for observable behaviors (validated through user research), MEDIUM for specific metrics (vary by game type and audience).

## Chapter Summary

### Core Principles

**Cognitive load is investment that must match aesthetic payoff and audience capacity.** Not inherently good or bad. High load serves Mastery, low load serves Submission. Your job: create the load profile that achieves your aesthetic goals for your target audience.

**Three load types: Tracking, Decision, Execution.** Different archetypes emphasize different types. Different aesthetics tolerate different levels. Total load = sum of all types simultaneously.

**Load comes from five sources: Core mechanic, resource management, goal tracking, context/meta-progression, and (for multiplayer) social coordination.** Allocate cognitive budget strategically—core mechanic should consume most budget, everything else must justify its cost.

**Archetypes have natural load profiles.** Investigation requires high tracking. Tactical combat requires high decision. Real-time action requires high execution. You can't violate these profiles without breaking the archetype. Match archetype to your aesthetic and audience.

**Investment-payoff principle governs everything.** Every feature, mechanic, or resource must create aesthetic payoff proportional to its cognitive investment. If not, reduce investment (automate, chunk, simplify) or increase payoff (make it serve aesthetic better) or cut it entirely.

**Load reduction strategies: Automation, chunking, progressive disclosure, offloading, simplification.** Use strategically. Automation removes busywork. Chunking reduces trackables. Progressive disclosure spreads load across time. Offloading enables depth for hardcore. Simplification reduces total load but also depth.

**Load changes across loop scales.** Micro loops demand execution load, meso loops demand decision load, macro loops demand tracking load, meta loops demand memory load. Design each scale for appropriate load type.

**Investment trajectories show load changes over time.** Novices have low capacity, experts have high capacity. Challenge aesthetics increase load over time (skill progression). Mastery aesthetics reveal complexity gradually. Submission aesthetics maintain low load (routines automate).

**Validation requires observable behaviors, not just self-reports.** Watch for: constant UI checking (tracking too high), analysis paralysis (decision too high), execution errors (execution too high), early quit (total too high). Flow state indicates load is right.

### The Cognitive Load Design Process

1. **Identify total budget** (from Chapter 1 investment profiles: Casual 3-5 units, Midcore 5-8 units, Hardcore 8-15+ units)

2. **Allocate budget by sources** based on aesthetic priorities:
   * Core mechanic (largest allocation)
   * Resource management (Chapter 3)
   * Goal tracking (loop scales)
   * Context/meta-progression
   * Social (if multiplayer)

3. **Design to archetype's natural profile** (Chapter 2):
   * Investigation → high tracking acceptable
   * Tactical → high decision acceptable
   * Action → high execution acceptable
   * Check archetype-load matrix for your chosen archetype

4. **Apply load reduction strategies** where budget exceeded:
   * Automate busywork
   * Chunk related information
   * Progressive disclosure for complex systems
   * Allow offloading for hardcore depth
   * Simplify ruthlessly where features don't serve aesthetic

5. **Distribute load across loop scales** (integration with Chapter 6):
   * Micro loops: minimize tracking/decision, focus on execution
   * Meso loops: meaningful decisions, clear goals
   * Macro loops: persistent state, resumption support
   * Meta loops: optional depth, no FOMO

6. **Validate through observable behaviors**:
   * Playtest with target audience
   * Watch for load indicators (UI checking frequency, decision time, error rates)
   * Measure flow state achievement
   * Iterate based on observations

7. **Test investment-payoff ratio**:
   * Does each feature create aesthetic payoff for its load cost?
   * Can players engage with core aesthetic, or do supporting systems block access?
   * Is total load within audience capacity?

### Integration Across Chapters

**Cognitive load connects to everything:**

* **Chapter 1:** Investment profiles determine budget, aesthetics determine appropriate load
* **Chapter 2:** Archetype determines natural load profile, medium constrains load management
* **Chapter 3:** Resources are primary tracking load source, 3-5 guideline is load constraint
* **Chapter 5:** Balance must be perceivable within cognitive budget
* **Chapter 6:** Loop architecture distributes load across time, stopping points reduce resumption load

**Cognitive load is middle-foundation chapter:**

* Receives aesthetic goals (Chapter 1) and archetype constraints (Chapter 2)
* Provides complexity budgets and load frameworks
* Influences balance design (Chapter 5) and temporal structure (Chapter 6)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Adding features without considering cognitive cost (death by a thousand cuts)
* ❌ Treating cognitive load as resource not constraint (can't "spend" and "recover" attention)
* ❌ Targeting wrong audience (4X for casual, pure Submission for hardcore)
* ❌ Violating archetype's natural load profile (Investigation without tracking complexity)
* ❌ Exceeding cognitive budget with supporting systems (meta-game more complex than core)
* ❌ No load reduction strategies (overwhelming complexity without support)
* ❌ Automating meaningful choices (reduces load but removes aesthetic payoff)
* ❌ Tutorial dumps (progressive disclosure failure)
* ❌ Poor resumption support (macro/meta loops without journals/recaps)

### What's Next

Chapter 5 explores **Balance**—how to set numerical parameters so your game creates appropriate challenge and fairness. Cognitive load determines what players can perceive and evaluate. Balance must work within those constraints. A perfectly balanced game that players can't understand the balance of isn't actually balanced in practice.

The journey from aesthetic goals to playable systems requires managing both what players can do (resources, Chapter 3) and what they can think about (cognitive load, Chapter 4). Together, these shape whether your experiential scaffold is accessible, engaging, and achieves its purpose.

**Confidence Level for Chapter Overall:** HIGH for core frameworks (three load types, investment-payoff principle, load reduction strategies), HIGH for archetype-load profiles (validated through game analysis), MEDIUM for budget allocation percentages (working hypothesis requiring case-by-case validation), MEDIUM for playtesting protocols (validated through practice but individual variation high).
