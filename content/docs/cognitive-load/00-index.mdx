# Cognitive Load and Game System Design

## Chapter Overview

This chapter explores cognitive load as a fundamental constraint in game design and a powerful tool for creating specific experiential scaffolds. We examine how different cognitive load profiles create different play experiences, and provide a systematic framework for designing game systems that match their intended experiential goals.

## Chapter Structure

### Part 1: Foundations

**[01-foundations.md](./01-foundations.mdx)**

* What is cognitive load?
* Cognitive load vs. resources (the critical distinction)
* Types of cognitive load
* Why this matters for game design

### Part 2: Cognitive Load as Design Tool

**[02-load-as-design-tool.md](./02-load-as-design-tool.mdx)**

* Different load profiles create different experiences
* Aesthetic mappings (MDA framework)
* When high load works (and when it doesn't)
* When low load works (and when it doesn't)

### Part 3: Load Types and Game Examples

**[03-load-types-and-examples.md](./03-load-types-and-examples.mdx)**

* Simultaneity load (StarCraft, real-time games)
* Memory/knowledge load (Warhammer, complex systems)
* Decision load (Chess, meaningful choices)
* Tracking load (Dwarf Fortress, state management)
* Calculation load (when math helps vs. hinders)
* Pattern recognition load (Dark Souls, learning through play)
* Social/communication load (Among Us, coordination)
* Detailed game analysis across load dimensions

### Part 4: Investment and Cognitive Load

**[04-investment-and-load.md](./04-investment-and-load.mdx)**

* How investment changes cognitive load over time
* Load reduction patterns (Dark Souls, automation through practice)
* Load revelation patterns (StarCraft, mastery reveals depth)
* Investment types (mastery, collection, social, temporal)
* The mastery paradox
* Design implications for learning curves

### Part 5: Load Distribution and Social Play

**[05-load-distribution.md](./05-load-distribution.mdx)**

* Distributed cognitive load (cooperative games)
* Asymmetric load (different roles, different demands)
* Social cognitive load (deception, coordination, reputation)
* When to distribute vs. concentrate load
* Design implications for multiplayer systems

### Part 6: Load Appropriateness and Mismatch

**[06-load-appropriateness.md](./06-load-appropriateness.mdx)**

* Load in service of experience (StarCraft, Chess)
* Load in wrong place (EVE Online, Death Stranding)
* Load barriers (Warhammer entry costs)
* Intentional extremes (Dwarf Fortress niche design)
* Diagnosing and fixing load problems

### Part 7: Player Types and Load Preferences

**[07-player-types.md](./07-player-types.mdx)**

* Bartle's taxonomy applied to cognitive load
* Achievers and conquerable high load
* Explorers and tolerance for messy complexity
* Socializers and preference for distributed load
* Killers and load as competitive weapon
* Designing for target audience

### Part 8: Supporting and Removing Load

**[08-load-support-systems.md](./08-load-support-systems.mdx)**

* Externalization tools (journals, maps, trackers)
* UI and information design
* Automation and offloading
* Simplification without dumbing down
* Tutorial and onboarding design
* Learning curves and mastery progression

### Part 9: Design Process Framework

**[09-design-process.md](./09-design-process.mdx)**

* Step-by-step framework for load-driven design
* From scenario to load profile to system design
* Load analysis template
* System design principles
* LLM integration considerations
* Validation and testing methods

### Part 10: Case Study - Busy Adults Monthly Game

**[10-case-study-busy-adults.md](./10-case-study-busy-adults.mdx)**

* Applying the framework to a concrete scenario
* Load analysis and requirements
* System design decisions
* How we arrived at Fate Accelerated
* LLM enhancements for memory management
* Validation and lessons learned

### Part 11: Case Study - Aliens Horror One-Shot

**[11-case-study-aliens.md](./11-case-study-aliens.mdx)**

* Applying framework to high-load horror scenario
* Cognitive impairments as design element
* Non-conscious intelligence as system
* Novel mechanics from load analysis
* Comparison to Busy Adults case study
* Framework flexibility demonstration

### Part 12: Connections and Integration

**[12-connections.md](./12-connections.mdx)**

* How cognitive load relates to resources (previous chapter)
* How cognitive load relates to game systems framework
* How cognitive load relates to experiential scaffolds
* How cognitive load relates to balance (future chapter)
* Unified design perspective

### Part 13: Open Questions and Future Research

**[13-future-research.md](./13-future-research.mdx)**

* Measuring cognitive load empirically
* Optimal load curves and flow states
* Cognitive accessibility considerations
* LLM capabilities and limitations
* Emergent complexity and load creep
* Areas needing further investigation

### Part 14: Summary and Principles

**[14-summary.md](./14-summary.mdx)**

* Core insights recap
* Design principles extracted
* Quick reference guide
* Decision-making checklists
* Key questions for designers
