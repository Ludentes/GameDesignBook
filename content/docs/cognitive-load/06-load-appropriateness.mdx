# Part 6: Load Appropriateness and Mismatch

## Introduction

Not all cognitive load is created equal. Load can be:

* **In service of the experience** (StarCraft's simultaneity creates the challenge)
* **A barrier to the experience** (Warhammer's rules overhead prevents casual play)
* **Actively working against the experience** (Death Stranding's complex systems disrupt meditative traversal)

This chapter explores the critical question: **Is the cognitive load appropriate for what this game is trying to do?**

We'll examine when load serves experience, when it hinders it, how to diagnose mismatches, and how to fix them.

***

## Load in Service of Experience

### When Cognitive Load IS the Point

Some games succeed BECAUSE of their high cognitive load. The mental effort isn't incidental—it's the core experience.

**Pattern: Load as Challenge**

The cognitive demand itself is what makes the game satisfying.

**Example 1: StarCraft (Simultaneity Load)**

**The load:**

* More actions possible than any human can execute
* Must manage economy, army, scouting, micro, positioning simultaneously
* Constant prioritization under time pressure

**Why it works:**

* **Load matches aesthetic:** Challenge/Mastery aesthetic requires conquerable difficulty
* **Skill expression through load management:** Better players aren't just faster, they're better at prioritizing
* **Fair constraint:** All players face same limitations (APM ceiling is human universal)
* **Elegant impossibility:** Simple actions, impossible totality (not arbitrary complexity)

**Key insight:** The impossibility of perfect play IS the game. Removing the load would remove the experience.

***

**Example 2: Chess (Decision Load)**

**The load:**

* Massive decision tree (dozens of legal moves, infinite variations)
* Deep calculation required (if I do X, opponent does Y, then I do Z...)
* Pattern recognition develops over years

**Why it works:**

* **Simple rules, infinite depth:** Load comes from implications, not rules complexity
* **Scales with skill:** Beginners see simple tactics, masters see positional subtleties
* **Turn-based allows processing:** No time pressure (except in blitz/bullet), can think deeply
* **Transparent:** Can see entire board, understand why you lost

**Key insight:** Decision load creates the skill ceiling. "Easy to learn, lifetime to master" is a feature, not a bug.

***

**Example 3: Dark Souls (Pattern Recognition Load)**

**The load:**

* Must learn enemy attack patterns through repetition
* Death is information-gathering (what does this boss do?)
* Pattern internalization through practice

**Why it works:**

* **Load decreases with investment:** First attempt is overwhelming, 20th attempt is manageable
* **Visible progress:** Can feel yourself getting better (not just RNG)
* **Fair learning curve:** Patterns are consistent (not random), learnable
* **Earned mastery:** Beating boss feels satisfying BECAUSE you conquered the load

**Key insight:** Front-loading cognitive load, then reducing it through practice, creates satisfying progression. The game is teaching you through enforced repetition.

***

### Pattern: Load Reveals Systemic Insight

Sometimes high cognitive load forces players to engage with complex systems deeply enough to understand them—which is the point.

**Example: Capitalism simulation game (from experiential scaffolds doc)**

**The load:**

* Track multiple economic actors
* See how wealth compounds over time
* Notice systemic patterns (rich get richer)

**Why it works:**

* **Load creates understanding:** Must engage with system to see how it functions
* **But not overwhelming:** Transparent cause-effect (see money make money)
* **Visceral, not abstract:** FEEL the unfairness through gameplay

**Key insight:** The cognitive work of tracking the system IS how players come to understand it. Simplifying too much would obscure the lesson.

***

### Characteristics of Appropriate Load

When cognitive load serves the experience:

**1. Load aligns with aesthetic**

* Challenge aesthetic → high load is expected and welcome
* Fellowship aesthetic → low load frees brainspace for socializing
* Discovery aesthetic → load comes from synthesis, not bookkeeping

**2. Load matches player expectations**

* Genre conventions set expectations (RTS = high APM, party games = low complexity)
* Marketing/presentation signals load level
* Players self-select into appropriate experiences

**3. Load enables skill expression**

* Better players manage load more effectively
* Mastery is visible and satisfying
* Load isn't arbitrary difficulty (just memorize random facts), but meaningful challenge

**4. Load is transparent**

* Players understand what they need to do (even if execution is hard)
* Failure teaches (not punishes randomly)
* Can see path to improvement

**5. Load scales appropriately**

* Beginners aren't overwhelmed immediately
* Experts find continued depth
* OR game is honestly marketed as "this is hard, deal with it"

***

## Load Mismatches: Wrong Place, Wrong Type

### When Load Works Against Experience

**Load mismatch** occurs when cognitive demands conflict with the intended experience. The mental effort required isn't creating the desired aesthetic—it's preventing it.

### Type 1: Load in Wrong Place (Activity Mismatch)

**Pattern:** Game promises one kind of experience, but load is focused elsewhere.

**Example 1: Death Stranding (Meditative vs. Systems Management)**

**Intended experience (seemingly):**

* Meditative traversal across beautiful landscape
* Contemplative gameplay (walking simulator aesthetic)
* Connection theme (helping other players through shared infrastructure)

**Actual load profile:**

* LOW load: Walking/traversal (mostly autopilot)
* HIGH load: Menu management, crafting, equipment optimization, resource gathering
* MEDIUM load: Story (convoluted plot, lengthy cutscenes)

**The mismatch:**

* Players wanting **meditative experience** are interrupted by **complex systems**
* Players wanting **systems optimization** are bored by **slow walking**
* Load types are competing, not harmonizing

**Result:** Polarizing reception

* Some players: "This is genius, the systems deepen the experience"
* Other players: "I just want to walk, why are there so many menus?"
* Very few: "This is fine" (mismatch creates strong reactions)

**What went wrong:**

* Low-load activity (walking) paired with high-load systems (crafting/menu)
* If walking is the point, systems should be minimal (support, not dominate)
* If systems are the point, traversal should be faster (not compete for attention)

***

**Example 2: Kingdom Hearts (Action vs. Lore)**

**Intended experience (seemingly):**

* Fast-paced action combat (ARPG)
* Explore Disney worlds
* Accessible to Disney fans

**Actual load profile:**

* MEDIUM load: Combat (real-time, but not overly complex)
* EXTREMELY HIGH load: Story/lore (convoluted plot across 10+ games)
* HIGH load: Understanding what's happening (requires extensive external research)

**The mismatch:**

* Players wanting **action gameplay** must sit through **lengthy cutscenes** with **incomprehensible plot**
* Players wanting **story** find it **locked behind gameplay** and **spread across multiple games/platforms**
* Cannot engage with one without the other

**Result:**

* "I skip all cutscenes, just let me fight"
* "I watch cutscenes on YouTube, don't want to play"
* Story load is barrier to gameplay, gameplay is barrier to story

**What went wrong:**

* High narrative load (requires knowledge of entire series) for what presents as action game
* Can't separate loads (story gates gameplay progression)
* Lore becomes homework instead of discovery

***

**Example 3: EVE Online (Spreadsheets for Space Combat)**

**Intended experience (seemingly):**

* Space combat and exploration
* Massive multiplayer universe
* Epic fleet battles

**Actual load profile:**

* LOW load: Actual piloting (mostly clicking in space)
* EXTREMELY HIGH load: Economic optimization, spreadsheet analysis, market manipulation
* HIGH load: Politics, diplomacy, coordination (meta-game)

**The mismatch:**

* Game presents as **space combat simulator**
* Actual success requires **economic/spreadsheet mastery**
* "Playing Excel Online" meme captures the mismatch

**Result:**

* Players drawn to space combat fantasy find **unexpected cognitive domain**
* Game actively selects for people who enjoy spreadsheets
* Not necessarily bad design (has dedicated audience), but massive genre mismatch

**What went wrong:**

* Presentation (space ships, combat) doesn't match reality (economic simulator)
* Load is in domain players didn't sign up for
* Could be fixed by clearer marketing OR different systems

***

### Type 2: Load Barriers (Can't Start Playing)

**Pattern:** Cognitive load prevents engagement before experience even begins.

**Example 1: Warhammer 40,000 (Entry Barrier)**

**The barrier:**

* Must buy, assemble, paint models (time, money, skill)
* Must read rulebook (100+ pages)
* Must read codex for your army (another 100+ pages)
* Must learn interactions, stratagems, special rules
* Must understand meta (or get crushed)

**Why it's a barrier:**

* VERY HIGH upfront investment before first game
* Can't play casually (need extensive prep)
* Can't try before committing (models are expensive)
* Expertise advantage is enormous (rule knowledge > tactics)

**Result:**

* Ultra-dedicated community (survivors of barrier)
* Excludes casual players entirely
* "I'd love to play but can't invest the time/money"

**What went wrong:**

* Investment required before you know if you'll enjoy it
* No low-investment entry point (can't try before buying)
* Load doesn't decrease much with play (new codexes, rule updates)

**How to fix:**

* Simpler starter rules (onboarding version)
* Rental/demo programs (try before buying)
* Digital version (remove physical investment barrier)
* Rules reference tools (reduce memory load)

***

**Example 2: Dwarf Fortress (Intentional Barrier?)**

**The barrier:**

* ASCII graphics (requires mental translation)
* Hundreds of interacting systems
* Opaque mechanics (must experiment or read wiki)
* Steep learning curve (hours before competence)
* Inevit able failure (fortress will collapse, repeatedly)

**Why it's a barrier:**

* Can't play casually (requires serious time investment to learn)
* Interface actively fights you (not just complex systems, but complex UI)
* No hand-holding (intentionally old-school)

**But:**

* Community embraces the barrier ("Losing is fun")
* Difficulty is part of the identity
* Players who overcome barrier are VERY dedicated

**This is intentional extreme:**

* Not trying to appeal to everyone
* Barrier filters for specific audience
* Those who persist find incredibly deep game

**Key insight:** Not all barriers are bad design. Dwarf Fortress succeeds BECAUSE of its niche appeal, not despite it. But must be honest about who it's for.

***

### Type 3: Load Creep (Starts Fine, Becomes Overwhelming)

**Pattern:** Game begins with manageable cognitive load, but accumulates complexity until it becomes overwhelming.

**Example 1: Civilization Late Game**

**Early game:**

* Few cities, manageable decisions
* Clear priorities (expand, build infrastructure)
* Exciting discoveries (new techs, meeting civs)

**Late game:**

* Dozens of cities, each needs management
* Hundreds of units to move each turn
* Complex diplomatic web
* Every decision is micro-optimization

**The creep:**

* Load increases gradually (boiling frog effect)
* By late game, taking a turn can take 30+ minutes
* Victory is clear but tedious to execute
* "I know I've won, but it'll take 50 more turns to finish"

**Result:**

* Players quit before victory (too tedious)
* "One more turn" becomes "I can't face another turn"
* Late game is chore, not climax

**How to fix:**

* Automation tools (governor systems, auto-explore)
* Faster victory conditions (don't require conquering every city)
* Limit city count (fewer but more meaningful cities)
* Parallel processing (simultaneous turns in multiplayer)

***

**Example 2: Trading Card Games (Power Creep)**

**Early meta:**

* Limited card pool, clear strategies
* Straightforward interactions
* New players can compete with budget decks

**Years later:**

* Thousands of cards to know
* Complex interactions and combos
* Extensive meta knowledge required
* Expensive chase cards dominate

**The creep:**

* Each expansion adds complexity
* Old players keep up gradually (incremental learning)
* New players face ENTIRE complexity at once (insurmountable)

**Result:**

* Hostile to new players (can't catch up)
* "Pay to compete" or "study for months"
* Load barrier grows over time

**How to fix:**

* Rotation (remove old cards from legal play)
* Simplified formats (limited card pool)
* Catch-up mechanics (boost new players)
* Better onboarding (tutorial decks, AI practice)

***

### Type 4: Unnecessary Load (Doesn't Serve Experience)

**Pattern:** Cognitive load exists but doesn't contribute to core experience. It's just...there.

**Example 1: Arbitrary Resource Tracking**

**The load:**

* Tracking ammunition, arrows, torches, rations
* Counting individual gold pieces
* Managing encumbrance (weight of items)

**Does it serve experience?**

* **If survival game:** YES (resource scarcity creates tension)
* **If heroic adventure:** NO (tedious bookkeeping distracts from story)

**When it's unnecessary:**

* Doesn't create interesting decisions (always buy max ammo)
* Doesn't impact strategy (never run out in practice)
* Just slows down play (time spent counting, not playing)

**How to fix:**

* Abstract it (Light/Heavy/Critical resources instead of exact counts)
* Remove it (assume heroes have basic supplies)
* Make it meaningful (scarcity actually matters)

***

**Example 2: Complex Initiative Systems**

**The load:**

* Roll initiative
* Add modifiers
* Sort all combatants
* Track who goes when
* Adjust for speed changes, delays, readied actions

**Does it serve experience?**

* **If tactical combat:** MAYBE (turn order can be strategic)
* **If narrative game:** NO (interrupts flow for minimal benefit)

**When it's unnecessary:**

* Turn order doesn't matter much (effects are similar)
* Time spent sorting > strategic value
* Players forget and ask "whose turn is it?" repeatedly

**How to fix:**

* Simplify (players go, then enemies, no sorting)
* Popcorn initiative (you go, then you pick who goes next)
* Side-based (all players, then all enemies)
* Remove initiative entirely (declare actions simultaneously)

***

## Diagnosing Load Problems

### Observable Symptoms

**How to tell if cognitive load is inappropriate:**

**Symptom 1: Players use workarounds**

* External spreadsheets, calculators, wikis
* Note-taking during play (when not intended)
* "I can't play without looking this up"

**Diagnosis:** Load too high for memory, or information poorly presented

***

**Symptom 2: Analysis paralysis**

* Players take very long turns deciding
* "I don't know what to do"
* Overwhelmed by options

**Diagnosis:** Decision load too high, or options unclear

***

**Symptom 3: Players ignore systems**

* "I just skip that part"
* Simplifying strategies (intentionally avoiding complexity)
* "The meta is to ignore X mechanic"

**Diagnosis:** System is too complex for benefit, or doesn't serve experience

***

**Symptom 4: Autopilot / disengagement**

* Players going through motions without thinking
* Bored despite game continuing
* "I know I'll win/lose, but have to finish"

**Diagnosis:** Load too low (no meaningful decisions), or load creep (tedious execution)

***

**Symptom 5: Early drop-off**

* Players quit before finishing
* Can't get past tutorial / early game
* "I want to like this but can't get into it"

**Diagnosis:** Entry barrier too high, onboarding poor, or load mismatch with expectations

***

**Symptom 6: Frustration at "wrong" aspects**

* Players complain about mechanics, not challenge
* "Why do I have to do this?" (about intended feature)
* Anger at systems, not in-game adversaries

**Diagnosis:** Load is in wrong place (doesn't match genre expectations)

***

**Symptom 7: Toxic social dynamics**

* Quarterbacking (one player dominates decisions)
* Blame for failures (not collaborative problem-solving)
* Exclusion of new players ("too complicated to explain")

**Diagnosis:** Load distribution problems, or entry barrier creating expertise gatekeeping

***

### Diagnostic Questions

**Ask:**

**1. What is the intended core experience?**

* What should players feel?
* What should they understand?
* What should they do?

**2. Where is the cognitive load actually falling?**

* What are players spending mental effort on?
* What do they find challenging?
* What do they find tedious?

**3. Does load serve the experience?**

* Is the mental effort creating the desired aesthetic?
* Or is it obstructing it?
* Could the experience exist without this load?

**4. Is load where players expect it?**

* Genre conventions
* Marketing promises
* Initial presentation

**5. Can players manage the load?**

* Too overwhelming (paralysis, quitting)
* Too easy (boredom, autopilot)
* Just right (engaged, challenged)

**6. How does load change over time?**

* Onboarding: Can players start easily?
* Mid-game: Does complexity accumulate manageably?
* Late-game: Does it become tedious or remain engaging?

**7. Are there barriers preventing engagement?**

* Upfront investment (time, money, study)
* Knowledge prerequisites
* Social gatekeeping (experts excluding novices)

***

## Fixing Load Mismatches

### Strategy 1: Remove Unnecessary Load

**When:** Load doesn't serve experience, just adds friction.

**How:**

* **Simplify:** Reduce options without reducing depth
* **Abstract:** "Light/Medium/Heavy" instead of exact counts
* **Automate:** Computer/system handles bookkeeping
* **Eliminate:** Remove mechanic entirely if not needed

**Example: D\&D 5e vs 3.5e**

* 3.5e: Complex skill system, many modifiers, calculation-heavy
* 5e: Advantage/disadvantage, proficiency bonus, streamlined
* **Result:** Faster play, more accessible, still deep tactics

***

### Strategy 2: Move Load to Right Place

**When:** Load exists but is in wrong domain.

**How:**

* **Identify core experience:** What SHOULD demand cognitive effort?
* **Offload other domains:** Simplify, automate, or remove
* **Focus load on core:** Make the right things challenging

**Example: Gumshoe (investigation games)**

* **Wrong load:** Rolling to find essential clues (randomness, not detective work)
* **Right load:** Interpreting clues, synthesis, deciding what to investigate
* **Fix:** Automatic clue discovery, challenge is in understanding not finding

***

### Strategy 3: Distribute or Concentrate Load

**When:** Total load is manageable, but distribution is wrong.

**How:**

* **Distribute if:** Players want cooperation, load is too high for individuals
* **Concentrate if:** Distributed load creates coordination overhead, players want solo challenge

**Example: Co-op games**

* **Problem:** One player doing everything (quarterbacking)
* **Fix:** Separate information (can't quarterback if you don't know everything)
* **Or:** Explicit roles (each player has unique responsibilities)

***

### Strategy 4: Lower Entry Barrier

**When:** Upfront investment prevents players from trying game.

**How:**

* **Graduated onboarding:** Simple version first, complexity added gradually
* **Lower material cost:** Try-before-buy, digital versions, starter sets
* **Better tutorials:** Learn by doing, not reading
* **Quick start rules:** Subset of full rules for first session

**Example: Warhammer 40K (potential fixes)**

* Starter box with simplified rules
* Digital version (no model cost)
* Quick-start missions (not full army building)
* Rental program at game stores

***

### Strategy 5: Manage Load Creep

**When:** Game becomes overwhelming as it progresses.

**How:**

* **Automation tools:** Let system handle micro-management
* **Faster victory conditions:** Don't require exhausting cleanup
* **Limit growth:** Cap complexity (max cities, max units)
* **Phase transitions:** Late game SIMPLIFIES instead of complicates

**Example: Into the Breach (tactics game)**

* Only 3 units (never grows)
* Battles are 8x8 grid (small, focused)
* Perfect information (can plan completely)
* Victory in 4-5 turns (no tedious cleanup)
* **Result:** Late game is MORE elegant, not MORE complex

***

### Strategy 6: Match Load to Aesthetic

**When:** Load profile doesn't fit intended experience.

**How:**

* **Challenge aesthetic:** High load is expected, embrace it
* **Fellowship aesthetic:** Low mechanical load, high social
* **Narrative aesthetic:** Minimal calculation, maximal story flow
* **Discovery aesthetic:** Load in synthesis, not tracking

**Example: Blades in the Dark (heist RPG)**

* **Aesthetic:** Improvisation, heist fiction, tension
* **Load profile:**
  * LOW prep (flashback mechanic removes planning load)
  * MEDIUM consequences (stress, heat, wanted level)
  * HIGH narrative (improvise details, build on each other)
* **Result:** Load serves aesthetic (improvisation without overwhelming prep)

***

### Strategy 7: Be Honest About Load

**When:** Game IS high-load by design, but players don't know.

**How:**

* **Marketing clarity:** "Complex grand strategy" not "casual fun"
* **Difficulty ratings:** Explicit load warnings
* **Genre signals:** Use conventions (RTS = high APM expected)
* **Community reputation:** Let word spread about what game demands

**Example: Dwarf Fortress**

* Community openly says "This is hard, you'll fail, embrace it"
* "Losing is fun" as motto
* Not trying to trick casual players into playing
* **Result:** Self-selection works, dedicated community

***

## Load Appropriateness Checklist

When designing or analyzing a game:

### Core Experience Check

* [ ] What is the intended experience (feel, understand, do)?
* [ ] What aesthetic(s) are primary (Challenge, Fellowship, Narrative, Discovery, etc.)?
* [ ] What cognitive load does this aesthetic require?

### Load Profile Check

* [ ] Where is cognitive load concentrated (simultaneity, decision, memory, tracking, calculation, pattern, social)?
* [ ] Does this match intended experience?
* [ ] Is load in domains players expect?

### Load Appropriateness Check

* [ ] Does load serve the experience (creates desired aesthetic)?
* [ ] Or obstruct it (prevents desired aesthetic)?
* [ ] Is load the POINT (challenge) or a TOOL (enables other experiences)?

### Entry Barrier Check

* [ ] Can players start playing quickly (15-30 min to first action)?
* [ ] Is upfront investment reasonable (time, money, study)?
* [ ] Do players understand what they're getting into (marketing/presentation accurate)?

### Progression Check

* [ ] Does load scale appropriately (beginner → expert)?
* [ ] Does complexity creep (becomes overwhelming over time)?
* [ ] Can players opt into depth (or forced to engage with everything)?

### Failure Mode Check

* [ ] Do players use workarounds (wikis, spreadsheets, mods)?
* [ ] Do players quit early (can't overcome barrier)?
* [ ] Do players complain about "wrong" things (mechanics, not challenge)?
* [ ] Does load create toxic dynamics (quarterbacking, exclusion, blame)?

### Fix Assessment

* [ ] Can unnecessary load be removed?
* [ ] Can load be moved to right place?
* [ ] Should load be distributed or concentrated differently?
* [ ] Can entry barrier be lowered?
* [ ] Can load creep be managed?
* [ ] Does marketing match reality?

## Case Studies: Load Appropriateness

### Case Study 1: StarCraft (Load Serves Experience)

**Intended experience:** High-skill competitive strategy, mastery through APM and decision-making

**Load profile:**

* VERY HIGH simultaneity (multiple locations, real-time)
* HIGH decision load (build orders, army composition, tactics)
* MEDIUM memory (unit counters, timings)

**Appropriateness:**

* ✅ **Load matches aesthetic:** Challenge/Mastery requires conquerable difficulty
* ✅ **Load IS the skill ceiling:** Better players manage impossibility better
* ✅ **Transparent failure:** Can see why you lost (didn't scout, bad macro, poor micro)
* ✅ **Scales well:** Bronze → Masters → Pro (continuous improvement)

**Why it works:**

* Load serves experience directly (managing cognitive constraints IS the game)
* Fair (all players face same limitations)
* Elegant (simple actions, impossible totality)

***

### Case Study 2: Death Stranding (Load Mismatch)

**Intended experience:** (Unclear—this is the problem)

* Meditative traversal? OR
* Complex systems management? OR
* Narrative experience?

**Load profile:**

* LOW traversal load (mostly walking, some obstacle navigation)
* HIGH systems load (crafting, equipment, resource management, menu navigation)
* HIGH narrative load (lengthy cutscenes, convoluted plot)

**Appropriateness:**

* ❌ **Load types compete:** Meditative gameplay interrupted by complex menus
* ❌ **Unclear priority:** Is walking the point, or systems optimization?
* ❌ **Polarizing:** Different players engage with different aspects, frustrated by others

**Why it fails for many:**

* Load mismatch creates confusion about what game IS
* If walking = meditation, systems are obstruction
* If systems = depth, walking is boring
* Different experiences packaged together unhappily

***

### Case Study 3: Warhammer 40K (Load Barrier)

**Intended experience:** Epic tabletop battles with customizable armies

**Load profile:**

* VERY HIGH entry load (buy/build models, learn rules, study codex)
* HIGH in-game load (rules interactions, stratagems, measurements)
* HIGH knowledge load (opponent's army, meta, FAQs)

**Appropriateness:**

* ⚠️ **Load matches depth:** Complex systems create tactical depth
* ❌ **Entry barrier too high:** Can't try before massive investment
* ❌ **Load doesn't decrease:** New codexes, rule updates, constant study
* ✅ **Dedicated community:** Those who stay are VERY committed

**Why it's problematic:**

* Barrier excludes potential players (can't discover if they'd enjoy it)
* Success DESPITE barrier (strong IP, miniatures hobby appeal)
* Could be more accessible without losing depth

***

### Case Study 4: Dark Souls (Load Teaches)

**Intended experience:** Challenging but fair combat, mastery through learning

**Load profile:**

* HIGH pattern recognition (learn enemy attacks through death)
* MEDIUM spatial awareness (positioning, camera management)
* LOW rules complexity (simple controls, clear mechanics)

**Appropriateness:**

* ✅ **Load decreases with practice:** First attempt overwhelming, 20th manageable
* ✅ **Load reduction IS progression:** Feel yourself improving
* ✅ **Transparent:** Can see what killed you, learn from mistakes
* ✅ **Simple controls:** Load is learning patterns, not executing complex inputs

**Why it works:**

* Front-loads load (brutal at first), then rewards investment with mastery
* Load serves experience (difficulty → satisfaction when conquered)
* Fair (not random, patterns are consistent)

***

## Summary: Diagnosing and Fixing Load Problems

**Key insights:**

1. **Load must serve the experience**—if cognitive effort doesn't create desired aesthetic, it's obstruction not design.

2. **Load mismatch creates polarization**—different players engage with different aspects, frustrated by others (Death Stranding).

3. **Load barriers prevent discovery**—can't find out if you'd enjoy game without heavy upfront investment (Warhammer).

4. **Load creep exhausts players**—starts fine, becomes overwhelming (Civ late game, TCG meta complexity).

5. **Unnecessary load is friction**—if it doesn't create meaningful decisions or deepen experience, remove it.

**Diagnostic tools:**

* **Observable symptoms:** Workarounds, paralysis, autopilot, drop-off, frustration, toxicity
* **Key questions:** Does load serve experience? Is it where expected? Can players manage it?
* **Checklist:** Core experience, load profile, appropriateness, barriers, progression, failure modes

**Fix strategies:**

* **Remove:** Unnecessary load that doesn't serve experience
* **Move:** Load to right place (core experience, not tangential)
* **Distribute/Concentrate:** Adjust based on cooperation vs. solo challenge
* **Lower barrier:** Graduated onboarding, reduced upfront cost
* **Manage creep:** Automation, faster endings, limit growth
* **Match aesthetic:** Ensure load profile fits intended experience
* **Be honest:** Marketing and presentation should reflect reality

In the next chapter, we'll explore how different player types have different load preferences—and how to design for your target audience.
