# Part 11: Case Study - Aliens Horror One-Shot

## Introduction

This case study demonstrates the design process framework applied to a complex, high-load scenario: a horror one-shot featuring cognitive impairments, non-conscious alien intelligence, and tactical survival gameplay.

**Scenario context:**

* Players are miners/mercenaries extracting resources from an alien hive
* Strong magnetic fields induce neurological conditions (blindsight, aphasia, hemispatial neglect, etc.)
* Alien intelligence is pattern-based, non-conscious (inspired by Peter Watts' *Blindsight*)
* One-shot format (3-4 hours, possibly extending to second session)
* Themes: Intelligence without consciousness, consciousness as vulnerability

**Why this scenario is challenging:**

* Multiple competing aesthetics (Horror + Challenge + Discovery + Education)
* High total cognitive load across multiple dimensions
* Requires novel mechanics (no existing game solves this)
* Philosophical themes must emerge from gameplay
* Cognitive impairments as BOTH mechanical challenge AND thematic element

This case study shows how the framework handles complexity and generates truly novel systems.

***

## Step 1: Analyze the Scenario

### Core Experience Goals

**What should players FEEL?**

* **Dread/unease:** Something is fundamentally wrong, hostile environment
* **Confusion/disorientation:** Can't trust own perceptions, mind is unreliable
* **Vulnerability:** Usual capabilities compromised, exposed to threat
* **Awe/wrongness:** Encountering truly alien intelligence (not anthropomorphic)
* **Dark humor:** Gallows humor about horrifying situation (pressure valve)

**Emotional pacing:**

* **Intensity:** High peaks of terror, baseline of unease
* **Escalation:** Start weird, get worse (ratcheting wrongness)

***

**What should players UNDERSTAND?**

* **Intelligence without consciousness exists:** Alien is smart but not aware (pattern-based responses)
* **Consciousness is a liability:** Human self-awareness makes them predictable/vulnerable
* **Cognitive functions are separable:** Losing left-visual-field ≠ losing all function
* **Adaptation under constraint:** Humans can compensate for impairments through teamwork
* **Incomprehensibility is okay:** Some things can't be fully understood (and that's terrifying)

**Key insight:** Themes must emerge from MECHANICS, not exposition. Players should feel/discover these ideas through play.

***

**What should players DO?**

* **Primary actions:** Mine resources, survive encounters, adapt to impairments, coordinate as team
* **Decision types:**
  * Tactical (how to fight/evade with disabilities?)
  * Strategic (push forward or retreat?)
  * Interpersonal (coordinate despite communication barriers)
* **Time scale:** Mission-based (2-4 hours of real-time play, represents \~hours of in-game time)

***

**Constraints**

**Player constraints:**

* **One-shot format:** Can't rely on long learning curve (must onboard quickly)
* **Need engagement immediately:** 15-20 minutes to playing, not lengthy prep
* **Cognitive impairments must matter:** Not just flavor text, actual mechanical challenge
* **But not frustrating:** Disabilities should be interesting constraints, not purely punitive

**Content constraints:**

* **Horror atmosphere:** Weird/wrong, not gratuitous gore
* **Philosophical themes:** Emerge from play, not lectured
* **Alien behavior:** Must feel intelligent but incomprehensible
* **Accessibility paradox:** Game ABOUT disabilities must handle them respectfully

**Technical constraints:**

* **LLM available:** For alien behavior generation, atmosphere, impairment adjudication
* **Visual aids helpful:** Maps, impairment cards, tokens
* **Turn-based preferred:** Real-time would be overwhelming with impairments

***

## Step 2: Determine Cognitive Load Requirements

### Load Type Analysis

**2.1 Simultaneity Load: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Justification:**

* Must track: own impairment, teammates' impairments, environmental hazards, alien behavior, mission objective, resources
* BUT turn-based structure gives processing time
* Not real-time panic (like StarCraft), but still many threads to track

**Design implication:**

* Turn-based allows thinking time
* Visual aids reduce tracking burden (map, tokens, impairment cards)
* Enough complexity to feel chaotic, but manageable with tools

***

**2.2 Decision Load: HIGH (constrained by impairments)**

**Justification:**

* Tactical decisions under novel constraints ("I can't see left side, how do I position?")
* This IS the point—creative problem-solving with disabilities
* Not overwhelming paralysis, but meaningful choices with unusual parameters

**Design implication:**

* Impairments create interesting tactical questions
* Clear options within constraints (not infinite possibility space)
* Roleplay opportunities ("How WOULD someone with aphasia warn their team?")

***

**2.3 Memory/Knowledge Load: LOW-MEDIUM**

**Justification:**

* One-shot = can't require extensive rules mastery
* But players must remember THEIR specific impairment effects
* Can't rely on memorizing alien behavior (that's part of the horror)

**Design implication:**

* Impairment reference cards (always visible)
* Simple core mechanics (complexity comes from impairments, not rules)
* Don't require meta-knowledge (no "you should know this from previous sessions")

***

**2.4 Tracking Load: MEDIUM (but offload aggressively)**

**Justification:**

* Spatial awareness important (positioning matters with impairments)
* Team positions, threat locations, resources
* This is necessary for tactical play

**Design implication:**

* Visual map with tokens (externalize spatial memory)
* Abstract resources (Light/Medium/Heavy, not exact counts)
* System tracks conditions invisibly (players don't manage their own debuffs)

***

**2.5 Calculation Load: MUST BE MINIMAL**

**Justification:**

* Already tracking impairments + spatial reasoning + tactics
* Adding math would push into overwhelm
* Want players thinking about "how to adapt to disability," not "what's 2d6+3-1+2"

**Design implication:**

* Simple resolution (2d6, compare to target, done)
* No modifiers for impairments (handled narratively, not numerically)
* Fiction-first resolution (describe action, system determines outcome)

***

**2.6 Pattern Recognition Load: MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Two types:**

**A) Alien behavior patterns:**

* Players should notice alien does X in response to Y
* BUT not fully understand WHY (non-conscious intelligence)
* Load is appropriate for Discovery aesthetic

**B) Impairment adaptation:**

* Players MUST learn to work around disabilities
* This is educational goal (understand separable cognitive functions)
* Load decreases as players internalize compensations

**Design implication:**

* Alien behavior has internal consistency (learnable patterns)
* But operates on alien logic (not fully comprehensible)
* Impairment effects are clear and consistent (can develop tactics)

***

**2.7 Social/Communication Load: HIGH**

**Justification:**

* Coordination essential for survival (can't solo this)
* Communication barriers create challenge (aphasia, inability to see same things)
* This IS part of the experience (how do you warn teammate when you can't talk?)

**Design implication:**

* Mechanics reward coordination (bonuses for teamwork)
* Aphasia represented through actual roleplay constraints
* Visual communication encouraged (drawing, gestures)
* Table can laugh at absurdity (pressure valve for horror)

***

**2.8 Overall Load Budget**

**Total cognitive demand: HIGH**

* But HIGH across specific, intentional dimensions
* NOT high because of poor design (unnecessary complexity)
* One-shot format = can sustain high intensity for short duration

**Target audience: Engaged players willing to handle complexity**

* Not casual party game
* But not ultra-hardcore either
* Players interested in horror, tactical challenge, philosophical themes

**Load priority:**

1. **Tactical challenge** (operating under impairments)
2. **Horror atmosphere** (wrongness, dread, confusion)
3. **Coordination** (teamwork with asymmetric abilities)
4. **Philosophical emergence** (themes arise from mechanics)
5. **Pattern recognition** (alien behavior, impairment mastery)

***

## Step 3: Identify Load Conflicts and Trade-offs

### Conflict Analysis

**Conflict A: Horror/Confusion vs. Tactical Clarity**

**The tension:**

* Horror works through uncertainty, confusion, lack of control
* Tactical challenge requires understanding options and consequences
* Can't have both pure confusion AND informed decision-making

**Resolution: Clear rules, unclear world**

* **Mechanics are transparent:** Players know what they CAN do
* **Situation is confusing:** Perceptions are unreliable, alien is incomprehensible
* **Example:** "You know you can attempt to shoot (clear option), but you have blindsight so you can't consciously tell me what you're aiming at (confusion)"

**Priority:** Tactical clarity wins. Horror comes from situation/atmosphere, not mechanical confusion.

***

**Conflict B: Impairments as Challenge vs. Impairments as Frustration**

**The tension:**

* Disabilities as pure mechanical penalty = unfun, feels punitive
* But ignoring impairments = defeats the point (thematic and educational)

**Resolution: Impairments create novel opportunities, not just limitations**

* Each disability has DISADVANTAGES (obvious constraints)
* But also ADVANTAGES (reduced cognitive load, unexpected capabilities, alien can't predict)
* Plus COORDINATION opportunities (teammates compensate, interesting teamwork)

**Example: Blindsight**

* Disadvantage: Can't consciously see/describe what you perceive
* Advantage: Reflexive actions don't require conscious processing (faster, less overthinking)
* Alien angle: Non-conscious action is harder for pattern-based intelligence to predict

**Priority:** Make disabilities interesting constraints, not purely negative.

***

**Conflict C: Alien Incomprehensibility vs. Player Agency**

**The tension:**

* If alien is completely random/arbitrary, players feel helpless
* But if fully understandable, loses alien-ness
* Need balance: partially learnable but never fully graspable

**Resolution: Alien has consistent internal logic but operates on alien values**

* Players CAN learn: "Alien does X when we do Y" (observable patterns)
* Players CAN'T understand: WHY it does X (no conscious motivation to anthropomorphize)
* **Example:** Alien always targets most "conscious-acting" human first (predictable behavior, but based on alien perception we don't fully share)

**Priority:** Some learnability (player agency) but maintain mystery (horror/theme).

***

**Conflict D: Philosophical Insight vs. Action-Oriented Play**

**The tension:**

* Themes (consciousness = liability, intelligence ≠ consciousness) require reflection
* But this is survival horror/tactical game, not philosophical discussion simulator
* Can't stop action for lectures, but themes must land

**Resolution: Mechanics DEMONSTRATE themes**

* **Show, don't tell:** Impaired characters succeed where "normal" ones fail
* **Emerge through play:** Notice that non-conscious actions work better against alien
* **Debrief after:** Discuss what just happened thematically (post-session reflection)

**Priority:** Action first, themes emerge naturally, explicit discussion after (not during).

***

## Step 4: Design Core Systems

### System 1: Impairment Cards (Asymmetric Abilities)

**Purpose:** Make cognitive impairments mechanically interesting and thematically relevant.

**Implementation:**

**Each player draws 1-2 impairment cards at start (or when entering high magnetic field zones):**

**Example Cards:**

**BLINDSIGHT**

* **What you can't do:** Consciously see or describe objects (motor system works, conscious vision doesn't)
* **What you can do:** Point, dodge, aim reflexively (roll with advantage for instinctive actions)
* **Roleplay:** Other players must describe what you're looking at; you can act but not explain why
* **Alien interaction:** Non-conscious actions harder for alien to predict (you're less "readable")

**LEFT VISUAL FIELD LOSS / HEMISPATIAL NEGLECT**

* **What you can't do:** Perceive anything on your left side (not blind, just doesn't exist to you)
* **What you can do:** Full function on right side, reduced information overload
* **Roleplay:** Must explicitly state "I look left" or you miss things
* **Tactical:** Positioning crucial (cover your left, teammate watches that side)

**APHASIA (Broca's or Wernicke's)**

* **Broca's:** Understand everything, can only speak 2-3 word phrases, or draw/gesture
* **Wernicke's:** Speak fluently but words come out wrong/nonsense, understand speech normally
* **Roleplay:** Actual constraint (limited vocabulary, drawing pictures, charades)
* **Table dynamic:** Creates communication challenge, but also comedy (pressure valve)
* **Advantage:** Less verbal processing = faster reactions in some contexts

**PROSOPAGNOSIA (Face Blindness)**

* **What you can't do:** Recognize faces or complex patterns (all faces look same)
* **What you can do:** Identify by voice, gear, behavior (other cues work fine)
* **Tactical:** Alien morphology is indistinguishable (all aliens look "same")
* **Advantage:** Not distracted by facial expressions, pattern-blind to certain alien cues

**ALIEN HAND SYNDROME**

* **What happens:** One hand occasionally acts independently (not under your control)
* **Roleplay:** GM/LLM occasionally controls one hand (reaches for things, types messages, gestures)
* **Advantage:** Unpredictability (even YOU don't know what you'll do)
* **Dark comedy:** Hand betrays you at inopportune moments

**Design notes:**

* Each card has: Disadvantages, Advantages, Roleplay guidance, Tactical implications
* Visually distinct (color-coded, clear iconography)
* Always visible (no memorization needed)
* Combine interestingly (two players with different impairments must coordinate)

***

### System 2: Core Resolution Mechanic

**Purpose:** Simple, fast resolution that doesn't add calculation load.

**Implementation: 2d6 + Approach**

**Approaches** (choose based on how you act):

* **Instinctive** (+2): Reflexes, autopilot, non-conscious action
  * Favored by: Blindsight, Alien Hand (when it helps)
  * Theme: Non-conscious action can be effective
* **Analytical** (+1): Deliberate reasoning, conscious planning
  * Favored by: "Normal" humans
  * Theme: Consciousness enables complex thought but creates predictability
* **Coordinated** (+2): Team action, communication-based
  * Requires: Successful coordination between players
  * Theme: Collective intelligence compensates for individual limitations
* **Desperate** (+0): Risky, high stakes, panic move
  * Horror flavor: Sometimes you just react

**Resolution:**

* Roll 2d6 + Approach bonus
* **6-:** Failure, complication (something goes wrong)
* **7-9:** Partial success, cost (you do it, but there's a consequence)
* **10+:** Success (you do what you intended)

**No modifiers for impairments** (handled through fictional positioning, not numbers)

**Example:**

* Player with blindsight: "I reflexively aim at the threat" → Roll Instinctive (+2)
* Player with aphasia: "I try to warn them... uh... 'THING! LEFT! BAD!'" → Roll Coordinated (teammate must interpret)
* Normal player facing alien: "I carefully aim and fire" → Roll Analytical (+1), but alien predicts this (fictional consequence)

**Why this works:**

* Fast (2d6 + small number, simple compare)
* No calculation load (fiction determines modifiers, not math)
* Supports theme (Instinctive and Coordinated get bonuses, Analytical is predictable)
* Clear results (three outcomes, easy to interpret)

***

### System 3: Alien Behavior Engine

**Purpose:** Make alien feel intelligent but incomprehensible, demonstrate "intelligence without consciousness."

**Implementation: Pattern-Based Responses (LLM follows rules)**

**Alien behavior rules** (hidden from players, enforced by LLM):

**Rule 1: Responds to electromagnetic signatures, not visual appearance**

* Detects active equipment, energy output, brain activity
* Can "sense" humans through walls if they're using tech
* Stealth = turning off EM sources, not hiding visually

**Rule 2: Optimizes for hive resource distribution, not individual survival**

* Doesn't "fear death" (no self-preservation instinct)
* Will sacrifice units if it improves hive efficiency
* Example: Sends drone to die if it reveals human positions

**Rule 3: Defends via learned patterns (stimulus-response, no reasoning)**

* IF \[humans in zone X] THEN \[deploy defenders]
* IF \[resource extraction detected] THEN \[sabotage attempts]
* Patterns are consistent but OPAQUE (players observe effects, not reasons)

**Rule 4: Cannot model conscious minds (doesn't predict fear, hesitation, creativity)**

* Predicts rational, optimal play (because that follows patterns)
* Confused by:
  * Irrational decisions (desperation, sacrifice)
  * Impaired humans (not acting "consciously")
  * Creative tactics (not in its learned patterns)

**Player-observable patterns:**

* "It always attacks within 30 seconds of us entering the hive" (stimulus-response)
* "It targets whoever has the most active equipment" (EM signatures)
* "It ignored Bob (blindsight) and attacked Alice (analytical player)" (conscious humans are predictable)

**Player-incomprehensible aspects:**

* WHY does it care about this resource node and not that one? (hive optimization logic unknown)
* WHAT is it trying to achieve? (no conscious goal, just pattern execution)
* WHY did it sacrifice that unit? (hive-level optimization, not individual logic)

**LLM role:**

* Generate specific behaviors within these rules
* Describe alien in non-anthropomorphic terms ("appendages flex rhythmically," not "it looks angry")
* Maintain consistency (players can learn patterns)
* Surface incomprehensibility (alien does smart things for unknowable reasons)

***

### System 4: Mission Structure and Pacing

**Purpose:** Provide clear objective, manageable scope, escalating tension.

**Implementation: Three-Act Structure**

**ACT 1: Arrival and Disorientation (30-45 min)**

**Objective:** Enter hive, begin resource extraction, encounter magnetic fields

**Load profile:**

* LOW initially (arrive, simple objectives)
* Introduce impairments gradually (one player enters field, draws card, roleplays effect)
* First alien encounter (establish weirdness, not immediate threat)

**What players learn:**

* How impairments work mechanically and in roleplay
* Hive is strange (alien geometry, magnetic effects, wrong-ness)
* Alien exists but isn't immediately aggressive

**Pacing:**

* Quick onboarding (here's your character, here's the mission)
* Impairments introduced through play (discover as you go)
* End with: First real alien encounter (sets stakes)

***

**ACT 2: Complications and Escalation (60-90 min)**

**Objective:** Extract resources while alien responds to intrusion

**Load profile:**

* HIGH (multiple impairments, alien active, resource management, coordination)
* Tactical combat/evasion (use impairments creatively)
* Discover alien patterns (maybe)

**What players learn:**

* How to coordinate despite impairments
* Alien behavior patterns (partial understanding)
* That non-conscious action works better (thematic emergence)

**Complications:**

* Magnetic fields strengthen (more/worse impairments)
* Alien adapts (patterns shift, but consistently)
* Resources running low (time pressure)

**Pacing:**

* Ratcheting tension (things get worse)
* Moments of dark comedy (aphasia struggles, alien hand betrayal)
* Tactical challenges (positioning, coordination under constraints)

***

**ACT 3: Climax and Extraction (30-60 min)**

**Objective:** Get out alive (with or without full resource haul)

**Load profile:**

* PEAK intensity (all systems in play, highest stakes)
* Clear objective (reach extraction point)
* Possible desperate choices (leave teammate? Abandon resources?)

**What players experience:**

* Payoff for learning alien patterns (if they did)
* Teamwork under maximum pressure
* Horror climax (alien fully active, environment most hostile)

**Resolution:**

* Success/failure clearly determined
* NOT open-ended (one-shot needs closure)
* Survivors escape, or don't (either is valid ending)

**Pacing:**

* Fast (no time for extensive planning)
* Desperate (resource-constrained, impairments at worst)
* Cathartic (one way or another, it ends)

***

**Post-game debrief (10-15 min):**

* Discuss what happened
* Surface themes explicitly ("Notice how Bob's blindsight worked better against the alien?")
* Philosophical reflection (consciousness = liability, intelligence ≠ consciousness)
* This is when education happens (not during play)

***

### System 5: Load Support Tools

**Purpose:** Make high cognitive load manageable.

**Visual Map:**

* Grid showing hive layout, magnetic field zones (color-coded intensity)
* Tokens for players, alien units, resources
* Clear line-of-sight indicators (for left-neglect players)

**Impairment Reference Cards:**

* Each player has their card visible
* Quick reference for effects, no memorization
* Includes roleplay prompts

**Resource Tracker:**

* Simple: Light/Medium/Heavy resources extracted
* Mission clock: Visual countdown (escalating tension)
* No detailed inventory (abstract)

**Collaborative Tools:**

* Drawing paper for aphasia players (communication via pictures)
* Team position board (who's where? Who watches whose blind side?)

***

## Step 5: Determine LLM Role

### LLM Integration Points

**\[LLM\_PRIMARY] - Core responsibilities:**

**1. Alien Behavior Generation**

* Follows hidden behavior rules (stimulus-response patterns)
* Generates novel responses within constraints
* Describes alien in non-anthropomorphic terms
* Makes alien feel smart but wrong
* **Risk:** Might anthropomorphize (needs strict prompting: "No conscious motivation, pattern-based only")

**2. Horror Atmosphere Maintenance**

* Describes magnetic field effects, hive biology, alien geometry
* Escalates dread gradually (starts weird, gets worse)
* Narrates impairment experiences ("Your left side simply ceases to exist")
* Maintains unsettling tone without desensitization
* **Risk:** Might become silly or excessive (needs calibration)

**3. Impairment Adjudication**

* Interprets how specific impairment affects specific action
* Provides sensory descriptions appropriate to impairment
* Suggests creative compensations players can attempt
* Keeps effects consistent but interesting
* **Risk:** Inconsistency between rulings (needs explicit impairment rules as reference)

**4. Mission Pacing**

* Introduces complications at appropriate times
* Escalates threat as mission progresses
* Provides clues about alien behavior (but not explanations)
* Reads table energy (when to pause, when to intensify)
* **Risk:** Might railroad or drag (needs flexibility)

***

**\[LLM\_SUPPORT] - Supporting roles:**

**1. NPC Team Members** (if fewer than 4 players)

* Can run NPC miners with their own impairments
* Provides coordination opportunities
* Can die dramatically to raise stakes (if narratively appropriate)

**2. Just-in-Time Rules Reference**

* "How does my blindsight affect this action?"
* "What can I see from this position with left-neglect?"
* Answers questions in context without breaking flow

***

**\[EXPLICIT\_SYSTEM] - NOT LLM, but structured data:**

**1. Dice Resolution**

* 2d6 + Approach is mathematical, not LLM interpretation
* Clear thresholds (6-, 7-9, 10+) are system rules

**2. Alien Behavior Rules**

* Hidden from players but explicit for LLM to follow
* Structured: IF (condition) THEN (response type)
* Not freely improvised (consistency matters)

**3. Impairment Mechanical Effects**

* Each impairment has defined effects (on reference card)
* LLM narrates creatively, but doesn't invent new rules mid-session

**4. Map and Spatial Relationships**

* Positions, distances, line-of-sight are deterministic
* Not LLM judgment calls

***

**\[HYBRID] - Both LLM and system:**

**1. Alien Response Generation**

* LLM generates specific alien behaviors
* System ensures they follow pattern-logic rules
* Example: System says "alien responds to EM signature," LLM describes HOW

**2. Complication Introduction**

* System determines WHEN complications occur (mission clock, failed rolls)
* LLM determines WHAT complication (magnetic surge, alien patrol, equipment failure)

**3. Horror Escalation**

* System structures pacing (three-act escalation)
* LLM describes specific wrongness ("the walls pulse," "gravity feels diagonal")

***

## Step 6: Design Load Support Systems

### Supporting Necessary Load

**Decision Load Support:**

* Impairment cards: Clear "what you can/can't do"
* LLM suggestions: "With blindsight, you could try reflexive fire"
* Coordination mechanics: Explicit bonuses for teamwork (encourages cooperation)
* No gotchas: Consequences foreshadowed, not hidden

**Social Load Support:**

* Aphasia communication tools: Paper, drawings, gestures encouraged
* Explicit coordination bonuses: Game rewards working together
* Turn structure: Everyone gets spotlight, can interrupt for warnings
* Dark humor safety valve: Table can laugh (release for horror tension)

**Tracking Load Support:**

* Visual map: Positions, field zones, threats visible
* Impairment cards: Always present reminder
* Abstract resources: Light/Medium/Heavy (not exact counts)
* Mission clock: Visual countdown (time pressure without complex tracking)

**Pattern Recognition Support:**

* "What we've learned" moments: LLM summarizes observed alien patterns
* Consistent alien behavior: Can learn if paying attention
* Impairment consistency: Each disability works same way every time

### Removing Unnecessary Load

**Calculation Removal:**

* 2d6 only (no modifiers in dice math)
* Impairments are fictional: Change what you attempt, not your numbers
* Resources are abstract: No inventory management

**Memory Removal:**

* One-shot friendly: No setting lore required
* Cards as memory: Impairment effects written down
* Clear mission: Simple objective (mine hive, survive, escape)

**Tracking Removal:**

* No HP/condition tracking: "Wounded" is narrative, not number
* No initiative: Fluid turns (whoever makes sense goes next)
* No detailed alien stats: LLM determines outcomes narratively

### Load Over Time

**First 15 minutes (Onboarding):**

* Choose/assign character (or generate random)
* Draw impairment card (if starting in field)
* Quick mission brief ("mine the hive, watch out for alien, magnetic fields mess with your brain")
* First action teaches resolution ("tell me what you do, roll 2d6 + Approach")
* Focus: "Who am I? What's wrong with me? What am I doing?"

**Next 2-3 hours (Session 1 - Main Play):**

* Initial exploration (weird but manageable, establish tone)
* Impairments introduced gradually (encounter fields, draw cards)
* First alien encounter (horrifying, barely survive or escape)
* Learn coordination around impairments
* Discover alien patterns (partially)
* Mission complications (hive reacts, fields strengthen)
* Focus: "How do we work together? What IS this thing? Can we escape?"

**If Session 2 Needed:**

* Brief recap (5 min: "You're in the hive, impairments are X/Y/Z, alien does A/B/C")
* Escalation (everything worse)
* Climax (final push to extraction)
* Resolution (escape or die)
* Debrief (discuss themes, what happened)
* Focus: "Final desperate push, survive, reflect"

**Investment Payoff:**

* Practice reveals: Creative uses of impairments, alien behavior patterns (partial)
* Mastery feels: Earned (figured out teamwork despite disabilities)
* Themes emerge: From experience (consciousness = predictability, impairments = advantages)

***

## Step 7: Validate Against Experience Goals

### Validation Checklist

**7.1 Does load profile support feelings?**

✅ **Dread/unease:** Horror atmosphere (LLM), escalating wrongness (mission clock), alien incomprehensibility
✅ **Confusion/disorientation:** Impairments create genuine perceptual confusion, magnetic field effects
✅ **Vulnerability:** Disabilities are real limitations, alien is effective threat
✅ **Awe/wrongness:** Alien behavior is intelligent but non-conscious (mechanically explicit)
✅ **Dark humor:** Aphasia roleplay, alien hand hijinks, table can laugh

**7.2 Does load profile support understanding?**

✅ **Intelligence without consciousness:** Alien behavior is pattern-based (LLM follows explicit rules)
✅ **Consciousness as liability:** Impaired characters LESS predictable to alien (mechanical advantage)
✅ **Cognitive functions separable:** Each impairment removes specific function, others remain (card design)
✅ **Adaptation under constraint:** High decision/social load creates problem-solving
✅ **Incomprehensibility:** Alien patterns observable but not fully understandable (LLM maintains mystery)

**7.3 Does load profile support actions?**

✅ **Mine resources:** Clear objective, abstract tracking
✅ **Survive encounters:** Tactical challenge with impairments, positioning matters
✅ **Adapt to impairments:** High decision load focused on creative solutions
✅ **Coordinate:** High social load, mechanics reward teamwork

**7.4 Load mismatches identified?**

**Potential Issue A: Total load might overwhelm some players**

* Simultaneity + Decision + Social + Pattern Recognition all MEDIUM-HIGH
* **Mitigation:** One-shot = can sustain intensity for short duration. Turn-based = processing time. Visual aids reduce tracking. Can ease up if table is struggling.

**Potential Issue B: Aphasia roleplay might frustrate efficiency-focused players**

* Communication challenge might feel like it's slowing down tactical play
* **Mitigation:** Dark humor valve (table can laugh). If not fun, offer card swap. Coordination bonus makes it mechanically rewarding.

**Potential Issue C: Alien might feel random if LLM doesn't follow logic consistently**

* If behaviors are inconsistent, players can't learn patterns (breaks Discovery aesthetic)
* **Mitigation:** Explicit rules for LLM to follow. Hybrid approach (LLM generates within constraints). Playtesting to ensure consistency.

**Potential Issue D: Philosophical themes might not land**

* Players might focus purely on tactics, miss thematic points
* **Mitigation:** Mechanics DEMONSTRATE themes (impaired succeeds, conscious fails). Post-game debrief explicitly discusses themes.

***

## Step 8: Comparison to Busy Adults Case Study

### Same Framework, Radically Different Results

**Why this validates the framework:** Starting with experience goals, the framework produces COMPLETELY DIFFERENT systems for different scenarios.

| Aspect                   | Busy Adults (Monthly)              | Aliens (One-Shot)                               |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Aesthetic**    | Fellowship                         | Challenge + Horror                              |
| **Total Cognitive Load** | LOW                                | HIGH                                            |
| **Memory Load**          | MUST BE MINIMAL (4-6 week gaps)    | LOW-MEDIUM (one-shot, cards as reference)       |
| **Decision Load**        | MEDIUM (meaningful but clear)      | HIGH (tactical under constraints)               |
| **Social Load**          | MEDIUM (the point of playing)      | HIGH (coordination essential)                   |
| **Simultaneity Load**    | LOW (single clear objective)       | MEDIUM-HIGH (many threads)                      |
| **Core Mechanic**        | Fiction-first, minimal tracking    | Fiction-first, BUT spatial/tactical             |
| **Resulted In**          | Fate Accelerated (existing system) | Novel system (impairment cards + pattern-alien) |
| **LLM Primary Role**     | Memory management, NPC consistency | Alien intelligence, horror atmosphere           |
| **System Complexity**    | Very simple (accessible)           | Moderate (one-shot can handle more)             |
| **Investment Type**      | Social ritual (monthly gathering)  | Intense experience (memorable one-shot)         |

### Key Insights

**1. Experience Goals Drive Everything**

* Busy Adults: Fellowship → minimize cognitive load → Fate
* Aliens: Challenge + Horror → high tactical load, but supported → novel system

**2. Constraints Shape Solutions**

* Busy Adults: Memory constraint (monthly) → externalize ALL state
* Aliens: One-shot constraint → can be more complex (short duration)

**3. Themes Dictate Mechanics**

* Busy Adults: Character-driven story → minimal mechanics, narrative focus
* Aliens: Philosophical exploration → mechanics ARE the philosophy (impairments = theme)

**4. LLM Integration Varies**

* Busy Adults: Memory manager (recap, continuity, NPC tracking)
* Aliens: Behavior engine (alien intelligence, atmosphere, impairment adjudication)

**5. Framework Is Flexible**

* Produced known-good solution (Fate) for known problem
* Produced novel system for novel problem
* Both are appropriate for their scenarios

## Lessons Learned and Design Takeaways

### What This Case Study Teaches

**1. High Load Can Work If Intentional**

* Aliens has HIGH total cognitive load
* But it's HIGH in service of experience (tactical challenge, horror confusion)
* Supported by tools (cards, map, simple resolution)
* Short duration (one-shot = can sustain intensity)

**2. Impairments as Game Mechanics (Accessibility Consideration)**

* Game ABOUT disabilities must handle them respectfully
* Not purely punitive (advantages + roleplay opportunities)
* Educational (demonstrates separable cognitive functions)
* But could be triggering (content warning needed)

**3. Philosophical Themes Through Mechanics**

* "Show, don't tell" applies to game design
* Mechanics demonstrate themes (impaired = less predictable)
* Players DISCOVER ideas through play
* Post-game discussion makes implicit explicit

**4. LLM for Non-Human Intelligence**

* LLM can maintain alien-ness (non-anthropomorphic descriptions)
* BUT needs explicit rules (prevent inconsistency)
* Hybrid approach: LLM generates, system constrains

**5. Horror Needs Cognitive Load Management**

* Horror = uncertainty, but game needs clarity
* Solution: Clear rules, unclear world
* Atmosphere through description, not mechanical confusion

**6. One-Shot Design Different Than Campaign**

* Can sustain higher load (short duration)
* Must onboard quickly (15 min to play)
* Needs closure (complete arc in one session)
* No ongoing state management

## Framework Validation: Did It Work?

**Test: Does this system achieve the experience goals?**

**Predicted outcomes if played:**

**Players will FEEL:**

* Dread (horror atmosphere, escalating threat)
* Confusion (impairments create genuine disorientation)
* Vulnerability (disabilities are real constraints)
* Dark humor (aphasia struggles, alien hand moments)

**Players will UNDERSTAND:**

* Intelligence ≠ consciousness (alien is smart but pattern-based)
* Consciousness = liability (predictability)
* Cognitive functions separable (specific deficits, other functions intact)
* Adaptation possible (teamwork overcomes limitations)

**Players will DO:**

* Tactical problem-solving (positioning with disabilities)
* Creative coordination (compensate for each other)
* Survive (or not—horror can end badly)

**Mechanics will DEMONSTRATE:**

* Impaired characters succeed better against alien (non-conscious = unpredictable)
* Conscious, analytical play is countered (alien learns patterns)
* Teamwork overcomes individual limitations (distributed cognition)

**Themes will EMERGE:**

* From gameplay (not lectures)
* Debrief makes explicit (post-game discussion)

***

**The framework successfully:**

* Identified appropriate load profile for experience
* Resolved conflicts between competing aesthetics
* Generated novel mechanics that serve themes
* Integrated LLM appropriately
* Provided support for necessary load
* Created system that (theoretically) achieves goals

**Next step:** Playtesting would validate predictions. Iterate based on observed player behavior.

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates that the cognitive load framework can:

1. **Handle complex scenarios** with multiple competing aesthetics
2. **Generate novel systems** (not just rediscover existing games)
3. **Integrate themes and mechanics** (philosophy through gameplay)
4. **Support high load appropriately** (tools, structure, clear rules)
5. **Adapt to different constraints** (one-shot vs. campaign, high vs. low load)

The Aliens scenario is vastly different from Busy Adults, yet the SAME framework produced appropriate systems for both. This validates that the framework captures real design principles, not just post-hoc rationalization.

**Key principle:** Start with experience goals, determine appropriate cognitive load, design systems that match—and you'll create games that deliver the intended experience.
