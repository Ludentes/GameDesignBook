# Part 12: Connections and Integration

## Introduction

Cognitive load doesn't exist in isolation. It interacts with every other aspect of game design: resources, systems, aesthetics, balance, and the overall experiential scaffolding we're building.

This chapter explores how cognitive load connects to:

* **Resources** (previous chapter in this book)
* **Game systems framework** (the broader design context)
* **Experiential scaffolds** (games as purpose-built experiences)
* **Balance** (future chapter)
* **The unified design perspective** (how everything fits together)

***

## Connection 1: Cognitive Load and Resources

### The Critical Distinction Revisited

From the Resource Management chapter, we established:

**Resources are IN the game:**

* Mechanical entities (HP, gold, spell slots, ammunition)
* Tracked by game system
* Can be spent, recovered, traded
* Create strategic choices through scarcity

**Cognitive load is EXTERNAL to the game:**

* Player mental capacity (working memory, attention, processing speed)
* Cannot be "spent" or "recovered" within game mechanics
* Designer accommodates it in design choices
* Like session length, player time, emotional bandwidth

**Why this matters:** Confusing resources with constraints leads to design errors.

***

### How They Interact

**1. Resources Create Cognitive Load**

**More resources = more tracking load:**

* D\&D 3.5e: HP, spell slots (multiple levels), temporary HP, ability damage, conditions, action economy
* Each resource is a separate thing to track
* Cognitive load increases with resource variety

**Complex resource systems = high decision load:**

* Magic: The Gathering: Five mana colors, card types, graveyard, exile, tokens
* Every resource interaction creates decisions
* Optimization requires mental calculation

**Design trade-off:**

* Rich resource systems create strategic depth (good)
* But increase cognitive burden (cost)
* Question: "Is this resource worth the cognitive overhead?"

***

**2. Cognitive Load Constrains Resource Design**

**Can't have unlimited resource complexity:**

* Human working memory \~7 items
* Beyond that, players lose track
* Example: Too many currency types in MMO (players confused, ignore some)

**Must match load to aesthetic:**

* Fellowship aesthetic: Simple resources (can socialize while playing)
* Challenge aesthetic: Complex resources acceptable (optimization IS the challenge)
* Example: Catan (simple resources, fellowship) vs. Brass: Birmingham (complex resources, challenge)

***

**3. Offloading Reduces Load Without Simplifying Resources**

**Digital games can track complex resources invisibly:**

* Computer handles math, state management
* Players see simplified interface, system maintains detail
* Example: Civilization (thousands of calculations, player sees "science per turn")

**Externalization tools help:**

* Token tracking (poker chips for currency)
* Dials for life (MTG spin-down dice)
* Digital character sheets (auto-calculate derived stats)

**Design insight:** Complexity can exist if TRACKING is offloaded.

***

**4. Resource Scarcity Creates Different Load Types**

**Abundant resources = low decision load:**

* If you always have enough, no interesting choices
* Example: Health potions too plentiful (just spam them)

**Scarce resources = high decision load:**

* Must optimize usage (when to spend?)
* Creates tension (am I wasting this?)
* Example: Limited spell slots (choose carefully)

**BUT: Too scarce = paralysis:**

* Players hoard, never use (too afraid to "waste")
* Example: Final Fantasy elixir problem (never use, "might need later")

**Sweet spot:** Scarce enough for decisions, plentiful enough to use.

***

### Design Implications

**When designing resource systems, consider:**

1. **How many resources can players track?**
   * Genre conventions (RPGs = more, party games = fewer)
   * Target audience (hardcore = tolerates more, casual = needs fewer)
   * Available tools (digital = can track more, analog = keep simple)

2. **What cognitive load does each resource add?**
   * Tracking (how much do I have?)
   * Decision (when to spend?)
   * Calculation (what's optimal?)
   * Memory (what's this resource for again?)

3. **Can load be offloaded?**
   * Computer tracking?
   * Physical tokens?
   * Reference sheets?

4. **Does this resource justify its cognitive cost?**
   * Does it create interesting decisions?
   * Or just busywork?
   * Example: Separate copper/silver/gold in RPG (could just use "gold" with decimals)

5. **How does resource scarcity affect cognitive load?**
   * Too abundant = decisions trivial (low load, low interest)
   * Optimal scarcity = meaningful choices (medium load, high interest)
   * Too scarce = decision paralysis (high load, frustration)

***

## Connection 2: Cognitive Load and Game Systems

### Defining Game Systems

From "What Is a Game System" document, a game system is a **configuration** of:

**Components:**

1. **Mechanics** (rules, verbs, what players can do)
2. **Parameters** (numbers, costs, balance values)
3. **Context** (fiction, theme, aesthetic framing)
4. **Pacing** (tempo, rhythm, escalation)

**Functions:**

1. Enable verbs (possible actions)
2. Create challenge (difficulty, obstacles)
3. Provide feedback (clarity, consequences)
4. Establish fiction (theme, coherence)
5. Guide pacing (structure, flow)
6. Enable emergence (unexpected interactions)
7. Reinforce aesthetics (how mechanics feel)

**Cognitive load affects ALL of these.**

***

### How Cognitive Load Shapes System Design

**1. Mechanics and Cognitive Load**

**More mechanics = more load:**

* Each verb adds: memory (what can I do?), decision (when to use it?), tracking (is it available?)
* Example: Fighting game with 50 special moves vs. 5

**Unified vs. varied mechanics:**

* Unified system: One resolution mechanic handles everything (lower load)
* Varied systems: Different mechanics for different contexts (higher load, but potentially more depth)
* Example: D\&D 5e (unified d20 resolution) vs. older editions (different systems for attack, saves, skills)

**Cognitive load sweet spot:**

* Too few mechanics: Shallow, solved quickly
* Too many mechanics: Overwhelming, can't learn them all
* Just right: Deep but learnable

***

**2. Parameters and Cognitive Load**

**Numerical complexity matters:**

* Simple numbers (HP 1-10) = easy to track mentally
* Complex numbers (HP 1-9999) = need calculator/UI
* Example: Modern board games trend toward smaller numbers (0-5 range)

**Derived stats increase load:**

* Base stat vs. derived stat (attack = strength + proficiency + magic bonus)
* Each derivation adds calculation load
* Solution: Pre-calculate and display result

**Too many parameters = optimization paralysis:**

* Min-maxers love complexity (Achievers)
* Casual players overwhelmed (Socializers)
* Example: Path of Expertise skill tree (thousands of options)

***

**3. Context (Fiction) and Cognitive Load**

**Fiction can REDUCE cognitive load:**

* Intuitive connections (fire melts ice = no need to memorize)
* Theming aids memory (Holy spell vs. Dark spell = obvious opposition)
* Example: Thematic deck names in card games (easier to remember than "Deck #7")

**But fiction can ADD load if inconsistent:**

* Arbitrary exceptions ("fire doesn't melt THIS ice because magic")
* Counter-intuitive rules (sneak attack only works with light weapons, not daggers)
* Cognitive dissonance (rules contradict fiction)

**Fiction should support mechanics, not fight them:**

* Good: Rogue is sneaky → bonuses to stealth
* Bad: Rogue is sneaky → complex sneak attack subsystem with exceptions

***

**4. Pacing and Cognitive Load**

**Pacing affects cognitive demand:**

* Real-time = high load (must process under time pressure)
* Turn-based = lower load (can think)
* Simultaneous = coordination load
* Example: StarCraft (real-time) vs. Civilization (turn-based)

**Rest/downtime manages load:**

* High-intensity moments (combat, crisis)
* Low-intensity recovery (exploration, social, town)
* Rhythm prevents exhaustion
* Example: Horror games (tension → relief → tension)

**Load creep across session:**

* Early session: Fresh, can handle complexity
* Late session: Tired, need simplification
* Example: Board game night (start with heavy game, end with light one)

***

### System Coherence and Cognitive Load

**Coherent systems have LOWER cognitive load:**

**Configuration coherence means:**

* Mechanics support context (fiction and rules align)
* Parameters are balanced (no trap options)
* Pacing matches aesthetic (Fellowship = relaxed, Challenge = intense)
* Functions work together (feedback reinforces emergence)

**When coherent:**

* Players understand intuitively (less memorization)
* Patterns emerge (can learn general principles)
* Load is appropriate (matches intended experience)

**When incoherent:**

* Rules feel arbitrary (must memorize exceptions)
* Decisions are unclear (no guiding principles)
* Load is frustrating (working against system, not with it)

**Example: Coherent system (Blades in the Dark)**

* Mechanics: Fiction-first, minimal rolling
* Context: Heist fiction, scoundrels in industrial city
* Pacing: Flashbacks remove planning load, stress tracks tension
* Result: Low mechanical load, high narrative load, thematically coherent

**Example: Incoherent system (some early RPGs)**

* Attack roll: d20
* Damage roll: Weapon-specific die
* Saving throws: d20 but different tables
* Skills: d100 (different system entirely)
* Result: High load from learning multiple resolution systems

**Design principle:** Coherent systems reduce cognitive load even when complex. Incoherent systems create load even when simple.

***

## Connection 3: Cognitive Load and Experiential Scaffolds

### Games as Purpose-Built Experiences

From "Games as Experiential Scaffolds" document:

**Core question:** What experience do we want someone to have, and what game system best creates that experience?

**A game is a scaffold:**

* Temporary structure that supports an experience
* Not the end goal itself (like construction scaffolding)
* What matters is what it enables you to do, understand, or feel

**Cognitive load is part of the scaffold design.**

***

### Matching Load to Experiential Purpose

**Different experiences require different load profiles:**

**1. Exploring Inequality Through Mechanics**

**Experience goal:** Viscerally understand systemic inequality

**Load requirement:**

* LOW mechanical load (don't obscure the system)
* Transparent cause-effect (must SEE how wealth compounds)
* Minimal calculation (focus on feeling, not optimization)

**Why:** If mechanics are complex, players focus on optimization instead of experiencing injustice.

**Example: Monopoly (original "The Landlord's Game")**

* Simple rules (can learn in 5 minutes)
* Transparent mechanics (rent is % of property value)
* Players FEEL the treadmill (not just understand abstractly)

***

**2. Inhabiting a Story World**

**Experience goal:** Feel like you're inside your favorite book/movie

**Load requirement:**

* LOW calculation (don't break immersion with math)
* Mechanics fade into background (not the focus)
* HIGH narrative load (fiction is primary)

**Why:** Immersion requires flow. Stopping to calculate breaks the fantasy.

**Example: Powered by the Apocalypse games**

* Simple resolution (2d6 + stat)
* Fiction-first (describe action, THEN roll)
* Mechanics support narrative (don't compete with it)

***

**3. Ethical Exploration Through Constrained Choice**

**Experience goal:** Explore moral questions through meaningful decisions

**Load requirement:**

* MEDIUM decision load (choices must be hard but clear)
* Transparent consequences (can see implications)
* LOW calculation (moral weight > mathematical optimization)

**Why:** Ethical dilemmas require focus on VALUES, not numbers.

**Example: Dogs in the Vineyard**

* Simple conflict system (escalate or not?)
* Clear consequences (violence has costs)
* Moral weight comes from fiction, not mechanics

***

**4. Detective Games and Structured Discovery**

**Experience goal:** Solve mystery through investigation

**Load requirement:**

* HIGH tracking load (clues, suspects, timelines)
* MEDIUM decision load (where to investigate next?)
* LOW mechanical load (investigation, not combat optimization)

**Why:** Cognitive effort should go to SYNTHESIS, not bookkeeping.

**Example: Gumshoe system**

* Auto-find core clues (no "roll to find" failure)
* Complexity is in interpretation, not mechanics
* Load is in detective work, not rules mastery

***

### The Scaffold Design Process

**Step 1: Define experiential purpose**

* What should players FEEL?
* What should they UNDERSTAND?
* What should they DO?

**Step 2: Determine appropriate cognitive load**

* Which load types serve the experience?
* Which load types would obstruct it?
* Where should complexity live?

**Step 3: Design systems to match**

* Mechanics that create desired load profile
* Remove load that doesn't serve purpose
* Support necessary load with tools

**Step 4: Validate**

* Does load profile match intended experience?
* Are there mismatches?
* Do players achieve the intended understanding/feeling?

**This is the design process framework (Part 9).**

***

### LLMs and Experiential Scaffolds

**What LLMs enable:**

**1. Purpose-Preserving Adaptation**

* LLM maintains experiential goal while responding to unpredictable actions
* Example: Detective game LLM maintains mystery coherence despite creative investigation

**2. Scaffold Maintenance**

* LLM "remembers" what experience is supposed to feel like
* Adapts content while preserving tone, themes, difficulty
* Example: Horror game LLM escalates dread appropriately

**3. Cognitive Load Management**

* LLM can offload tracking (state management, NPC memory)
* Can surface information just-in-time (reducing memory load)
* Can adjust complexity dynamically (harder for experts, easier for beginners)

**What LLMs don't replace:**

**Explicit systems still needed for:**

* Mechanical resolution (dice, calculations)
* Balance and parameters (numbers, costs)
* Core rules (what's possible, what's not)
* Player-facing information (transparent choices)

**LLM role:** Maintains thematic/narrative coherence, adapts to unpredictability, offloads cognitive burden. Systems provide structure, clarity, mechanical resolution.

## Connection 4: Cognitive Load and Balance (Future Chapter)

### Preview: How Load Affects Balance

**Balance asks:** "How much of each resource? How powerful is each option?"

**Cognitive load asks:** "Can players comprehend the balanced system?"

**They interact:**

***

**1. Perfect Balance Is Worthless If Too Complex**

**You can mathematically balance 100 options:**

* All equally powerful in different contexts
* Perfect rock-paper-scissors equilibrium

**But if players can't understand it:**

* Analysis paralysis (too many options)
* Can't evaluate trade-offs (too complex)
* "Solved" by community, not by players (need wiki to play)

**Design insight:** Balance must be PERCEIVABLE, not just actual.

***

**2. Cognitive Load Creates Practical Imbalance**

**Theoretically balanced options with different load:**

**Option A: Simple, obvious**

* Easy to use (low execution load)
* Players choose this often (accessible)

**Option B: Complex, optimal**

* Hard to use (high execution load)
* Players avoid this (too difficult)

**Result:** A dominates play, even though B is "better" in theory.

**Example: StarCraft unit compositions**

* Mass marines: Simple, easy to execute
* Complex multi-unit compositions: Theoretically better, but harder to control
* Bronze players use simple (low load), pros use complex (can handle load)

**Balance must account for cognitive accessibility.**

***

**3. Load Affects Perception of Balance**

**High-load options feel weaker:**

* Require more effort to execute
* Feel less rewarding (did I win because of skill or option strength?)

**Low-load options feel stronger:**

* Easy to execute
* Feel rewarding (effortless victory)

**Even if mathematically equal:**

* Players perceive low-load as better
* Community will favor accessible options

**Design consideration:** Factor player effort into balance equation.

***

**4. Balance Testing Requires Load Consideration**

**Can't just simulate optimal play:**

* Need to test at multiple skill levels
* Beginners don't execute optimally (high load)
* Experts do (low load from practice)

**Playtesting must assess:**

* Can players understand the options?
* Can they execute them under pressure?
* Do they perceive the balance, or need spreadsheet?

**Design process:** Balance for PLAYED game, not theoretical game.

***

### Future Chapter Preview

**Balance chapter will explore:**

* Cognitive load as balancing factor (execution difficulty = cost)
* Perceivable balance (players must understand trade-offs)
* Skill-indexed balance (different balance at different skill levels)
* Load-appropriate complexity (how much can balanced system contain?)

***

## Connection 5: Unified Design Perspective

### Bringing It All Together

**Game design is INTEGRATED:**

Cognitive load doesn't stand alone. It interacts with:

* Resources (what to track)
* Systems (how complex can mechanics be)
* Aesthetics (what experience are we creating)
* Balance (can players perceive and execute)
* Scaffolding (what experience are we enabling)

**Every design decision has cognitive implications.**

***

### The Cognitive Load Question in Every Design Choice

**When designing ANY system, ask:**

**1. What cognitive load does this create?**

* Tracking? Decision? Calculation? Memory? Pattern recognition? Social?
* How much? (Low, medium, high?)

**2. Does this load serve the experience?**

* Is it the POINT (challenge, mastery, discovery)?
* Or an OBSTACLE (unnecessary complexity)?

**3. Can players manage this load?**

* Given target audience, tools available, context (real-time vs. turn-based)
* Will they be overwhelmed? Bored? Engaged?

**4. How does this interact with other systems?**

* Does it compound with other load sources?
* Can load be distributed or offloaded?

**5. Is there a simpler way?**

* Can we achieve same effect with less load?
* Simplification without dumbing down?

***

### The Design Process Applied Universally

**From Part 9 (Design Process Framework):**

1. **Analyze scenario** (experiential goals, constraints)
2. **Determine load requirements** (what load serves experience?)
3. **Identify conflicts** (competing load demands)
4. **Design systems** (mechanics that match load profile)
5. **Determine LLM role** (what can/should LLM handle?)
6. **Support load** (tools, UI, onboarding)
7. **Validate** (does load match experience?)
8. **Iterate** (test, observe, refine)

**This process applies to:**

* **Resource systems** (how many resources? how to track?)
* **Mechanics design** (simple or complex? unified or varied?)
* **Aesthetic implementation** (what experience do we want?)
* **Balance decisions** (how complex can balanced system be?)
* **Overall game structure** (pacing, scope, progression)

**Key insight:** Cognitive load is not a separate consideration—it's woven through every aspect of design.

***

## Summary: Cognitive Load in Context

**Key integrations:**

1. **Resources and Load:** Resources create load (tracking, decisions). Must balance depth with cognitive capacity.

2. **Systems and Load:** Game systems ARE cognitive load configurations. Coherent systems have appropriate load.

3. **Scaffolds and Load:** Load profile must match experiential purpose. Different experiences need different loads.

4. **Balance and Load:** Balance must be perceivable and executable. Cognitive accessibility affects practical balance.

5. **Unified Perspective:** Load considerations permeate every design choice. Cannot be separated from other concerns.

**The central principle:**

**Cognitive load is not a problem to solve—it's a design tool to wield intentionally.**

Every game asks players to think. The question is: **What should they think ABOUT?**

* In resources? (Strategic optimization)
* In systems? (Understanding interactions)
* In balance? (Evaluating trade-offs)
* In fiction? (Immersion and imagination)
* In social dynamics? (Coordination, deception)
* In aesthetics? (Feeling and understanding)

**Design is choosing WHERE to place cognitive load, and ensuring it serves the experience you want to create.**

The framework, case studies, and connections in this book provide tools for making those choices intentionally, validating them through testing, and refining them through iteration.

In the next chapter, we explore open questions and future research directions—areas where our understanding of cognitive load in game design is still developing.
