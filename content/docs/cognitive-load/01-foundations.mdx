# Part 1: Foundations

## What Is Cognitive Load?

**Cognitive load** is the mental effort required to play a game—tracking information, making decisions, calculating outcomes, remembering rules, and managing attention.

When you sit down to play a game, you bring a finite amount of mental capacity. This capacity—we'll call it "brainspace"—is what you have available to engage with the game. Different games demand different amounts and types of brainspace, creating fundamentally different play experiences.

## The Pro Player Quote That Crystallized Everything

A professional StarCraft player (InControl) once joked:

> "I like StarCraft because there are always more things to do than any human can possibly do at each moment. I like Warhammer 40,000 because there are always more rules than any human can ever remember."

This observation captures something profound: both games create skill expression through **cognitive constraints**, but in fundamentally different ways:

**StarCraft:** You know all the rules (they're simple), but you can't execute everything simultaneously. Skill comes from **prioritizing what deserves your attention** under time pressure.

**Warhammer:** You can take all the time you need (turn-based), but you can't possibly remember every rule and interaction. Skill comes from **deep knowledge** and preparation.

Same constraint (human cognitive limits), but different types create different experiences.

## The Critical Distinction: Constraints vs. Resources

Before we go further, we need to establish something fundamental:

**Cognitive load is NOT a resource—it's a constraint.**

This distinction matters immensely because the design tools for resources don't apply to constraints.

### Resources (Internal to Game)

Resources are **mechanical entities tracked by the game system:**

* Hit points, gold, ammunition, spell slots
* Can be spent, recovered, traded
* Create strategic choices through explicit mechanics
* Part of game state
* Designer creates scarcity, recovery rates, spending options

**Example:** In a strategy game, gold is a resource. You spend it on units, earn it from mines, trade it with allies. The designer decides how much gold you start with, how fast you earn it, what it costs to buy things.

### Constraints (External to Game)

Constraints are **limitations on player capacity:**

* Cognitive capacity (brainspace)
* Time availability (session length)
* Attention span (can't focus forever)
* Emotional bandwidth (stress tolerance)
* Physical limitations (APM, accessibility needs)

**Example:** In the same strategy game, your ability to manage multiple bases simultaneously is a constraint. The designer can't give you "more brainspace" or "faster thinking" as a game reward. They can only accommodate or manipulate this constraint through design.

### Why This Distinction Matters

**Resources:** Designer creates internal economy

* "How much HP should this cost?"
* "What's the recovery rate for mana?"
* "Should gold be scarce or plentiful?"

**Constraints:** Designer works within external limits

* "Can players track this many resources?"
* "Is this calculable in real-time?"
* "Will players remember this between sessions?"

**Calling everything a "resource" creates confusion** because it suggests you can manipulate cognitive load the same way you manipulate gold or HP. You can't.

You can:

* **Work within cognitive constraints** (design systems players can handle)
* **Manipulate what demands attention** (where load is concentrated)
* **Support necessary load** (tools, UI, externalization)
* **Remove unnecessary load** (automation, simplification)

You cannot:

* Give players more cognitive capacity as a reward
* Let players "spend" brainspace and "recover" it
* Create interesting scarcity through cognitive deprivation (usually just creates frustration)

## Components of Cognitive Load

Cognitive load isn't monolithic. Different types of mental effort create different experiences:

### 1. Simultaneity Load

**How many things demand attention at once?**

* Real-time games: Multiple locations, threats, opportunities
* Turn-based games: Can be low (one thing at a time)
* Management games: Many systems running in parallel

**Example:** StarCraft requires managing base economy, army control, scouting, and harassment simultaneously. Chess requires evaluating only the current position (no simultaneity load).

### 2. Decision Load

**How many options must be evaluated? How deep is the decision tree?**

* Option count: 3 meaningful choices vs. 20 possible actions
* Depth: Immediate consequences vs. long-term implications
* Clarity: Transparent outcomes vs. hidden information

**Example:** Chess has high decision load (many possible moves, must calculate variations). Candy Crush has low decision load (match these three, obvious consequences).

### 3. Memory/Knowledge Load

**What must be remembered or known to play effectively?**

* Rules complexity: Simple core vs. hundreds of exceptions
* Game state: What happened previously
* Meta-knowledge: Strategies, counters, optimal builds
* Setting lore: Background needed to understand context

**Example:** Warhammer 40k has extreme memory load (codex rules, FAQs, army-specific interactions). Tic-tac-toe has minimal memory load (rules learned in 30 seconds).

### 4. Tracking Load

**What game state must be monitored continuously?**

* Resource levels: HP, mana, gold, supply
* Conditions: Buffs, debuffs, status effects
* Positions: Where things are, spatial relationships
* Timers: Cooldowns, countdowns, phases

**Example:** Dwarf Fortress requires tracking hundreds of dwarves, production chains, resources, threats, and fortress stability. Wordle requires tracking only the current guess and previous feedback (minimal).

### 5. Calculation Load

**What must be computed or estimated during play?**

* Arithmetic: Damage calculations, probabilities
* Optimization: Finding best value, efficiency analysis
* Risk assessment: Expected outcomes, variance
* Spatial reasoning: Angles, distances, areas

**Example:** Detailed wargames require calculating probability distributions and optimal positioning. Rock-paper-scissors requires no calculation.

### 6. Pattern Recognition Load

**What must be learned through experience?**

* Tactical patterns: Combos, counters, openings
* Strategic patterns: When to expand, when to attack
* Opponent patterns: Tells, habits, tendencies
* System patterns: How mechanics interact

**Example:** Dark Souls has high pattern recognition load (learn enemy attack patterns through repetition). Slot machines have no pattern recognition load (purely random).

### 7. Social/Communication Load

**What interpersonal cognitive work is required?**

* Deduction: Reading intentions, detecting lies
* Negotiation: Persuasion, deal-making, alliances
* Coordination: Team tactics, role fulfillment
* Reputation: Long-term relationship management

**Example:** Among Us has high social load (deduce impostor, persuade others, coordinate). Single-player puzzle games have no social load.

## How Load Types Interact

These load types don't exist in isolation—they combine and interact:

**StarCraft = High simultaneity + Medium decision + Low memory + High tracking + Low calculation + High pattern + Low social** (in 1v1)

**Result:** Frenetic, skill-intensive, exhausting but exhilarating

**Warhammer 40k = Low simultaneity + High decision + Extreme memory + High tracking + Medium calculation + Medium pattern + Medium social**

**Result:** Preparation-intensive, knowledge-rewarding, barrier to entry

**Wordle = Minimal across all dimensions**

**Result:** Accessible, casual, ritual-friendly

## The Brainspace Metaphor

"Brainspace" is shorthand for the mental capacity players have available. Think of it as a budget:

**You have 100 brainspace units. How do you spend them?**

* Tracking enemy positions: 20 units
* Calculating optimal move: 30 units
* Remembering rules: 10 units
* Socializing with friends: 15 units
* Maintaining immersion: 10 units
* Watching for threats: 15 units

When a game demands 120 units, something has to give:

* Drop some tracking (miss things)
* Simplify calculations (satisfice instead of optimize)
* Break immersion (stop roleplaying, just roll dice)
* Reduce socializing (get serious, stop joking)

**Different players have different budgets:**

* Tired parent after work: 60 units
* Alert teenager on weekend: 120 units
* Experienced player with automated skills: 80 units baseline, but 40 of those are "free" (automated)

**Different game states demand different budgets:**

* Chess opening (memorized): 40 units
* Chess middlegame (calculating): 100 units
* Chess endgame (pattern recognition): 60 units

## Why Cognitive Load Matters for Game Design

### 1. Load Determines Who Can Play

High cognitive load excludes players:

* New players overwhelmed by complexity
* Casual players lacking time to master systems
* Tired players unable to handle intensity
* Players with cognitive disabilities

Low cognitive load enables broader audiences but might bore experts.

**Design choice:** What audience are you targeting?

### 2. Load Shapes the Play Experience

Different load profiles create fundamentally different aesthetics:

* **High load + time pressure = Tension** (StarCraft, XCOM)
* **High load + no pressure = Mastery** (Chess, Go)
* **Low load + simple rules = Accessibility** (party games, casual mobile)
* **Low load + narrative focus = Immersion** (story games, walking simulators)

**Design choice:** What experience are you creating?

### 3. Load Interacts with System Complexity

You can have:

* **Simple rules, high emergent complexity** (Chess, Go)
* **Complex rules, manageable play** (offloaded to computer or GM)
* **Complex rules, high load** (traditional wargames)
* **Simple rules, simple play** (casual games)

**Design choice:** Where does complexity live?

### 4. Load Affects Investment and Retention

**High upfront load:**

* Barrier to entry (many players bounce off)
* But creates investment (sunk cost, mastery satisfaction)
* Rewards dedicated players

**Low upfront load:**

* Easy to start (broad appeal)
* But might lack depth (players leave when bored)
* Needs other retention mechanisms

**Design choice:** What investment model are you using?

### 5. Load Determines What LLMs Can Help With

LLMs can:

* **Manage hidden complexity** (track state, maintain consistency)
* **Generate adaptive content** (descriptions, NPCs, complications)
* **Provide just-in-time information** (rules lookup, reminders)

LLMs cannot:

* **Replace clear rules** (inconsistent at complex calculation)
* **Eliminate decision load** (might increase it through open-endedness)
* **Give players more brainspace** (can only reshape how it's used)

**Design choice:** Where should LLM help vs. where should systems be explicit?

## The Relationship to Resources (Previous Chapter)

If you've read the Resource Management chapter, you'll notice parallels:

**Resources (Chapter X):**

* Internal game entities (HP, gold, spell slots)
* Create strategic choices through scarcity
* Designer manipulates rates, costs, recovery
* Players manage strategically

**Cognitive Load (This Chapter):**

* External player capacity
* Shapes what resource systems are feasible
* Designer accommodates or manipulates attention
* Players manage unconsciously (or struggle)

**The Connection:**
Complex resource systems increase cognitive load. You must balance:

* **Resource depth** (strategic interesting-ness)
* **Cognitive cost** (mental effort to track/optimize)

**Example:** A game with 15 different resources might be strategically deep, but cognitively overwhelming. Collapsing to 5 resources with interesting interactions might create better play experience.

**Design principle:** Every resource costs brainspace. Is the strategic value worth the cognitive cost?

## The Experiential Scaffold Connection

If you've read the Experiential Scaffolds chapter, cognitive load is a crucial lens:

**Question:** "What experience do we want players to have?"

**Cognitive Load Asks:** "What mental effort does that experience require?"

**Examples:**

**Experience: Feel like a detective solving a mystery**

* **Needs:** High tracking load (clues, suspects, timings), high decision load (where to investigate), medium memory load (can take notes)
* **Doesn't need:** High calculation, simultaneity, or pattern recognition load
* **System design:** Support tracking (journals, maps), present clear choices, minimize math

**Experience: Feel overwhelmed by impossible odds**

* **Needs:** High simultaneity load (too many threats), time pressure, unclear priorities
* **Doesn't need:** Perfect information or certainty (defeats the point)
* **System design:** Create more demands than can be met, force triage

**Experience: Relax and socialize with friends**

* **Needs:** Low load across all dimensions (brainspace for conversation)
* **Doesn't need:** Complexity, calculation, or time pressure (competes with socializing)
* **System design:** Simple mechanics that fade into background

**Core Insight:** Match cognitive load profile to experiential goal.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cognitive load is mental effort required to play**—tracking, deciding, calculating, remembering, attending

2. **Cognitive load is a constraint, not a resource**—you can't give players more brainspace, only work within their limits

3. **Different load types create different experiences**—simultaneity vs. memory vs. decision vs. social all feel different

4. **Every design choice has a cognitive cost**—complex systems demand mental effort; is the value worth the cost?

5. **Load must match experiential goal**—detective games need tracking; relaxing games need minimal load; challenge games can sustain high load

6. **Players have finite brainspace budgets**—when demands exceed capacity, something breaks (immersion, decision quality, fun)

7. **Load interacts with everything else**—resources, systems, aesthetics, audience, LLM integration all connect to cognitive demands
