# Part 2: Cognitive Load as Design Tool

## Introduction: Load Is Not a Problem to Solve

The default assumption among many designers is that cognitive load is something to minimize—that simpler is always better, that players should never be confused or overwhelmed. This is wrong.

**Cognitive load is a design tool, not just a problem.**

Different amounts and types of cognitive load create fundamentally different player experiences. High load can create challenge, tension, and mastery satisfaction. Low load can enable fellowship, immersion, and accessibility. Medium load can facilitate discovery and creative problem-solving.

The question is never "how do we reduce cognitive load?" but rather "what cognitive load profile serves our experiential goals?"

This chapter explores:

* How different load levels create different aesthetic experiences
* When high load works (and when it's overwhelming)
* When low load works (and when it's boring)
* How to map load profiles to design goals

***

## The Core Insight: Load Profile Shapes Experience

**Load profile** = the pattern of cognitive demands a game places on players across different dimensions (simultaneity, decision complexity, memory requirements, etc.).

Two games can have the same mechanical complexity but feel completely different based on their load profiles:

**Example: Chess vs. Speed Chess**

* **Chess (untimed):** High decision load, low time pressure
  * Feel: Contemplative, strategic, patient
  * Aesthetic: Challenge through depth of calculation

* **Speed Chess (blitz):** Same rules, but added time pressure
  * Feel: Tense, reactive, adrenaline-inducing
  * Aesthetic: Challenge through performance under pressure

**Same mechanics, different load profile, completely different experience.**

This principle extends across all design choices:

* Real-time vs. turn-based affects simultaneity load
* Many options vs. few affects decision load
* Complex rules vs. simple affects memory load
* Hidden information vs. perfect affects tracking load

**Each choice shapes the player experience** by changing what mental effort the game demands.

***

## Aesthetic Mappings: MDA Framework and Cognitive Load

The MDA (Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics) framework identifies eight types of "fun" that games can create. Each aesthetic has different cognitive load requirements.

### 1. Sensation (Sensory Pleasure)

**Aesthetic goal:** Beautiful, novel, sensory stimulation

**Cognitive load requirement: VERY LOW**

* Players should experience, not analyze
* Thinking breaks immersion in sensation
* Attention goes to sensory input, not processing

**Examples:**

* Flower (PS3) - flow through landscapes, minimal decisions
* Journey - visual/emotional experience, simple controls
* Music/rhythm games - react to sensory input, not complex strategy

**Design principle:** Minimize mental effort so attention stays on sensory experience.

**When it works:**

* Players want to relax or be transported
* Sensory experience is genuinely compelling
* Mechanics are intuitive (learned in seconds)

**When it fails:**

* If sensory experience isn't engaging, low load = boring
* If players want challenge, sensation alone isn't satisfying

***

### 2. Fantasy (Make-Believe, Immersion)

**Aesthetic goal:** Feel like someone/something else, inhabit a world

**Cognitive load requirement: LOW TO MEDIUM**

* Too much calculation breaks immersion
* Too many rules pull attention to mechanics
* Enough complexity to make choices feel meaningful

**Examples:**

* Skyrim - immersive world, relatively simple combat/systems
* Modern D\&D 5e - simplified from 3.5e to support immersion
* Narrative RPGs (PbtA games) - fiction-first, minimal mechanics

**Design principle:** Mechanics should fade into background, support fiction.

**When it works:**

* Rules are intuitive enough to become invisible
* Decisions are framed in fiction, not numbers
* World/character is compelling enough to justify engagement

**When it fails:**

* Complex mechanics force "system" thinking (breaks character immersion)
* Too simple mechanics = choices feel meaningless
* Math-heavy resolution pulls players out of fiction

**Critical insight:** Fantasy is FRAGILE to cognitive load. Too much breaks immersion.

***

### 3. Narrative (Drama, Story)

**Aesthetic goal:** Experience a compelling story unfold

**Cognitive load requirement: LOW**

* Story flow disrupted by complex mechanics
* Pacing requires minimal friction
* Attention should be on "what happens next" not "how do rules work"

**Examples:**

* Telltale games - minimal mechanical complexity, branching story
* Visual novels - nearly zero load, pure narrative choices
* Fiasco - simple framework creates dramatic stories

**Design principle:** Remove all mechanical overhead that doesn't serve story.

**When it works:**

* Story is genuinely engaging
* Choices create narrative tension (not tactical optimization)
* Pacing maintains momentum

**When it fails:**

* If story isn't compelling, low load = boring
* If players want mechanical challenge, narrative alone disappoints
* If choices feel cosmetic (don't affect story), engagement drops

***

### 4. Challenge (Obstacle Course, Mastery)

**Aesthetic goal:** Overcome difficult obstacles, prove skill

**Cognitive load requirement: MEDIUM TO HIGH (but manageable)**

* High load creates difficulty to overcome
* Must be conquerable with skill/practice
* Too high = overwhelming, too low = trivial

**Examples:**

* Dark Souls - high pattern recognition load, but learnable
* Chess - extreme decision load, but turn-based allows processing
* Celeste - precise mechanical execution, manageable scope

**Design principle:** High load is THE POINT, but must reward mastery.

**When it works:**

* Load is conquerable through practice
* Failure feels like learning opportunity
* Mastery feels earned and satisfying
* Difficulty scales appropriately

**When it fails:**

* Load is arbitrary or inconsistent (can't learn patterns)
* Too complex to understand what went wrong
* Difficulty isn't fair (randomness, hidden rules)
* Overwhelming rather than challenging

**Key distinction:** Challenge requires HIGH load, but LEARNABLE complexity. Random difficulty isn't mastery.

***

### 5. Fellowship (Social Framework)

**Aesthetic goal:** Spend time with friends, social bonding

**Cognitive load requirement: LOW**

* Brainspace needed for conversation
* Mechanics shouldn't compete with socializing
* Rules should be simple enough to teach quickly

**Examples:**

* Catan - simple rules, lots of downtime for chat
* Codenames - minimal rules, encourages table talk
* Cards Against Humanity - nearly zero cognitive load

**Design principle:** Minimize mechanical load to maximize social bandwidth.

**When it works:**

* Group wants to socialize (not just game)
* Rules are learned quickly (new players can join)
* Downtime allows conversation
* Game provides structure without demanding attention

**When it fails:**

* If mechanics are too simple, game feels like excuse (not activity)
* If optimization is possible, some players focus on winning (breaks fellowship)
* If game requires intense focus, social aspect disappears

**Critical insight:** Fellowship games trade mechanical depth for social space. This is intentional, not a flaw.

***

### 6. Discovery (Exploration, Learning)

**Aesthetic goal:** Explore unknown territory, find new things

**Cognitive load requirement: VARIABLE (depends on discovery type)**

* **Spatial exploration:** Low to medium (navigating, observing)
* **System exploration:** Medium to high (learning mechanics, finding synergies)
* **Narrative exploration:** Low (following story threads)

**Examples:**

* Outer Wilds - low mechanical load, high exploration wonder
* Minecraft - variable load (exploration vs. redstone engineering)
* Slay the Spire - high system discovery load (card synergies)

**Design principle:** Load should match what's being discovered.

**When it works:**

* Discoveries feel meaningful (not arbitrary)
* Complexity reveals itself gradually
* "Aha!" moments reward exploration
* Players control their engagement depth

**When it fails:**

* Too complex = can't parse what's being discovered
* Too simple = nothing left to find
* Discoveries feel random (no pattern to learn)
* Forced tutorials remove discovery joy

***

### 7. Expression (Self-Expression, Creativity)

**Aesthetic goal:** Create something personal, express identity

**Cognitive load requirement: MEDIUM (tools vs. constraints)**

* Need enough complexity for expression space
* But too much = technical mastery overshadows creativity
* "Simple to learn, rich to explore"

**Examples:**

* Minecraft creative mode - simple tools, infinite expression
* Character creation in RPGs - complex options, personal meaning
* The Sims - moderate complexity, wide expression range

**Design principle:** Provide expressive tools without overwhelming.

**When it works:**

* Tools are intuitive enough to explore quickly
* Complexity enables uniqueness (not just cosmetic)
* Players can see their vision realized
* Expression is recognized/appreciated (by self or others)

**When it fails:**

* Technical complexity blocks creative flow
* Too simple = everyone's creations look similar
* No audience/recognition = expression feels empty

***

### 8. Submission (Pastime, Zen)

**Aesthetic goal:** Mindless relaxation, flow without thinking

**Cognitive load requirement: LOW TO MODERATE (repetitive, not complex)**

* Want engagement without mental strain
* Repetitive actions create meditative state
* "Easy to do, satisfying to repeat"

**Examples:**

* Cookie Clicker - minimal decisions, satisfying progression
* Tetris - simple rules, reactive flow
* Stardew Valley - relaxing routine, gentle optimization

**Design principle:** Create engaging rhythm without mental strain.

**When it works:**

* Actions are satisfying to repeat
* Progression is visible (numbers go up)
* Complexity is optional (can optimize or just play)
* Flow state emerges naturally

**When it fails:**

* Too much decision-making breaks meditative state
* Too simple = boring (need some engagement)
* Interruptions require attention shifts

***

## Cognitive Load Profiles: Patterns Across Aesthetics

### Pattern 1: Fellowship and Narrative Need LOW Load

**Why:** Both require attention elsewhere (social interaction or story flow).

**Design implication:** Minimize mechanical complexity. Simple rules, quick resolution, minimal tracking.

**Example:** Fate Accelerated

* Simple resolution (roll + modifier)
* Minimal tracking (aspects, not HP/resources)
* Fiction-first (describe action, then roll)
* **Serves:** Fellowship (table talk) and Narrative (story flow)

**Common mistake:** Adding mechanical depth to "improve" these games. This breaks the aesthetic by demanding attention that should go to story/socializing.

***

### Pattern 2: Challenge and Mastery Can Handle HIGH Load

**Why:** The difficulty IS the point. Players want something to overcome.

**Design implication:** High load is acceptable IF it rewards mastery and feels fair.

**Example:** StarCraft

* Simultaneity load: Always more to do than possible
* Decision load: Constant tactical choices
* Mechanical load: High APM demands
* **Serves:** Challenge (skill ceiling is infinite)

**Critical caveat:** High load must be LEARNABLE. Random or arbitrary complexity isn't challenge, it's frustration.

***

### Pattern 3: Discovery and Expression Want SCALABLE Load

**Why:** Different players engage at different depths. Needs to serve both.

**Design implication:** Simple surface, complex depths. Optional optimization.

**Example:** Minecraft

* Simple tools (place/break blocks = low load)
* Complex possibilities (redstone, farms = high load)
* Player chooses engagement level
* **Serves:** Discovery (for explorers) and Expression (for builders)

**Design pattern:** "Easy to learn, hard to master" or "casual-friendly, optimization-possible"

***

### Pattern 4: Submission Needs REPETITIVE, Not Complex Load

**Why:** Want engagement without thinking. Flow through pattern, not problem-solving.

**Design implication:** Simple actions, satisfying feedback, gentle progression.

**Example:** Tetris

* Simple rules (fit blocks together)
* Reactive not strategic (respond to pieces)
* Difficulty from speed, not complexity
* **Serves:** Submission (meditative flow)

**Common mistake:** Adding strategic depth to idle/casual games. Breaks the zen.

***

## When High Load Works

### Success Case 1: Challenge as Primary Aesthetic

**Game:** Chess

**Load profile:**

* Extreme decision load (calculating variations)
* High pattern recognition (board positions)
* But: Turn-based allows processing time

**Why it works:**

* Load is THE POINT (difficulty to master)
* Load is learnable (patterns compress over time)
* Load is conquerable (grandmasters exist, proving it's possible)
* Load is fair (same rules for everyone)

**Design lessons:**

* High load works when it's the goal
* Must be learnable, not arbitrary
* Turn-based helps manage high complexity
* Scalable skill ceiling (always room to improve)

***

### Success Case 2: "Skill Through Impossibility" (Elegant)

**Game:** StarCraft

**Load profile:**

* More actions possible than any human can execute
* Simultaneity creates prioritization challenge
* High mechanical + decision load

**Why it works:**

* Load creates unique skill expression (prioritization)
* Elegant constraint (one simple limit: attention)
* Always room to improve (even pros have inefficiencies)
* Competitive depth (load management IS the competition)

**Design lessons:**

* Impossible demands can work if elegant
* "What do I focus on?" is interesting question
* Load should reward good prioritization
* Must feel like making meaningful choices, not random chaos

***

### Success Case 3: Horror Through Overload

**Game:** They Are Billions (competitive mode)

**Load profile:**

* Same as single-player, but no pause
* Simultaneity + time pressure + consequences
* Too much to track perfectly

**Why it works:**

* Overload creates intended emotion (panic, tension)
* Temporary (one-shot or short sessions)
* Failure is content (stories of collapse)
* Load serves aesthetic (horror comes from being overwhelmed)

**Design lessons:**

* Overwhelming load can work for specific aesthetics
* Usually short duration (can't sustain forever)
* Failure must be interesting (not just punishing)
* Overload should be intentional, not accidental

***

## When High Load Fails

### Failure Case 1: Load Obscures What Matters

**Game:** Warhammer 40k (for new players)

**Load profile:**

* Hundreds of rules to learn
* Constant rule lookups during play
* High memory load prevents gameplay

**Why it fails:**

* Load is BARRIER, not challenge
* Can't play casually without extensive study
* Rules complexity obscures tactical decisions
* Load is memorization, not interesting choices

**Design lessons:**

* High load must serve the experience, not obstruct it
* If load prevents playing, it's too high
* Memorization load is least interesting type
* Barrier to entry costs players

**Note:** Warhammer succeeds DESPITE this, carried by miniatures and IP. But the load is a flaw, not a feature.

***

### Failure Case 2: Load in Wrong Place

**Game:** Kingdom Hearts series

**Load profile:**

* Action combat (should be reactive, low cognitive load)
* Convoluted lore requiring 10+ games' knowledge
* Load mismatch: action vs. narrative homework

**Why it fails:**

* Players wanting action are forced into lore homework
* Players wanting story face action barriers
* Neither group is well-served
* Load doesn't serve either aesthetic

**Design lessons:**

* Match load to primary aesthetic
* Don't force high load in orthogonal dimension
* Action games should have LOW narrative complexity
* Narrative games should have LOW mechanical complexity

***

### Failure Case 3: Overwhelming Chaos (Not Elegant Impossibility)

**Game:** Dwarf Fortress (for most players)

**Load profile:**

* Hundreds of simultaneous entities to track
* Dozens of systems interacting
* Cascading failures (one problem creates six more)
* Extreme tracking + memory + decision load

**Why it fails (for most):**

* Load is overwhelming, not challenging
* Can't learn patterns (too much emergent chaos)
* Failure feels random (couldn't see it coming)
* Not conquerable (even experts get surprised)

**But succeeds for niche audience:**

* Intentional extreme (features, not bugs)
* Failure IS content ("how my fortress fell" stories)
* Complexity enthusiasts love the chaos

**Design lessons:**

* Overwhelming load creates niche appeal
* If "losing is fun" is intentional, this can work
* Most players bounce off extreme load
* Know your audience (intentional extreme ≠ bad design)

***

## When Low Load Works

### Success Case 1: Fellowship as Primary Aesthetic

**Game:** Catan

**Load profile:**

* Simple rules (resource trading, building)
* Low tracking (visible game state)
* Low calculation (simple costs)
* Moderate decision load (meaningful but not deep)

**Why it works:**

* Brainspace available for socializing
* Quick to teach (new players join easily)
* Downtime during others' turns (conversation time)
* Mechanics provide structure without demanding attention

**Design lessons:**

* Fellowship needs LOW mechanical load
* Simple doesn't mean meaningless
* Social space is the priority
* Mechanics enable, not dominate, interaction

***

### Success Case 2: Immersion Through Simplicity

**Game:** Journey

**Load profile:**

* Minimal decisions (move, jump, sing)
* No complex systems
* No tracking or calculation
* Pure sensory + emotional experience

**Why it works:**

* Thinking would break immersion
* Attention stays on visuals and emotion
* Mechanics are invisible (learned instantly)
* Sensory experience is compelling enough alone

**Design lessons:**

* Sensation/Immersion aesthetics need VERY LOW load
* If experience is strong enough, no mechanical depth needed
* Complexity would distract, not enhance

***

### Success Case 3: Accessibility Through Low Load

**Game:** Modern D\&D 5e

**Load profile:**

* Simplified from 3.5e (less calculation)
* Advantage/disadvantage (replaces modifiers)
* Streamlined rules
* But still meaningful decisions

**Why it works:**

* Lower barrier to entry (new players can start faster)
* Less rules overhead = more time for story/roleplay
* Simplified doesn't mean trivial
* Still serves Challenge and Fantasy aesthetics

**Design lessons:**

* Simplification ≠ dumbing down
* Removing unnecessary complexity improves experience
* Accessibility serves wider audience
* Can simplify while maintaining depth

***

## When Low Load Fails

### Failure Case 1: Trivial Choices

**Game:** Many "walking simulators" or ultra-casual mobile games

**Load profile:**

* Nearly zero mechanical engagement
* Minimal decisions (or cosmetic only)
* No challenge or mastery

**Why it fails (for some players):**

* If content isn't compelling, boredom sets in
* No sense of agency or achievement
* "Am I even playing a game?"

**But succeeds for others:**

* Some players want minimal engagement
* Story or visuals might be enough
* Not every game needs challenge

**Design lessons:**

* Low load only works if something else is compelling
* Know your audience (casual vs. engaged players)
* If removing all challenge, need strong alternative draw

***

### Failure Case 2: Solvable Systems

**Game:** Tic-Tac-Toe

**Load profile:**

* Extremely simple rules
* Low decision space
* Completely solvable (optimal play = draw)

**Why it fails:**

* Too simple = no depth
* Solved game = no discovery
* No skill ceiling = boring after first plays

**Design lessons:**

* Low load must still have enough complexity for engagement
* Solvable games have no replayability
* Need some depth, even in simple games

***

### Failure Case 3: Shallow Optimization

**Game:** Many idle/clicker games (when not intended as Submission)

**Load profile:**

* Minimal active engagement
* Simple optimal strategy (obvious best choices)
* No meaningful decisions

**Why it fails:**

* If presented as Challenge, fails (no skill expression)
* If players want decisions, fails (only one good choice)
* Optimization is trivial

**But succeeds as Submission:**

* When goal IS minimal engagement
* Numbers going up is satisfying alone
* Meditation, not challenge

**Design lessons:**

* Match load to aesthetic goal
* Low load fails if players expect Challenge/Mastery
* Low load works if players want Submission/Fellowship

***

## The Goldilocks Principle: Context-Dependent "Just Right"

There is no universal "correct" cognitive load level. The right amount depends on:

1. **Primary aesthetic goal** (Challenge needs high, Fellowship needs low)
2. **Target audience** (hardcore vs. casual, Bartle types)
3. **Session structure** (one-shot can go higher, long campaigns need sustainable)
4. **Time constraints** (real-time limits load budget, turn-based allows more)
5. **Player expertise** (beginners need lower, experts want higher)

**"Just right" varies by context.**

### Example: Fighting Games

**Casual players:** Want low load (button mashing, simple moves)
**Competitive players:** Want high load (frame data, combos, mind games)

**Good design:** Scalable load

* Simple surface (anyone can play and have fun)
* Complex depths (frame-perfect execution, mix-ups, reads)
* Players choose engagement level

**Bad design:** Forcing everyone into one load level

* Too simple = boring for competitive players
* Too complex = inaccessible for casual players

***

## Design Implications: Matching Load to Goals

### Principle 1: Start With Aesthetic Goal

**Ask:** What experience do we want?

* Challenge/Mastery → Can handle high load
* Fellowship/Narrative → Need low load
* Discovery → Scalable load
* Submission → Low, repetitive load

**Then:** Design load profile to serve that goal.

***

### Principle 2: Load Must Serve Experience

**Good:** Load creates the intended feeling

* StarCraft: Overwhelm creates skill expression through prioritization
* Dark Souls: High pattern recognition creates mastery satisfaction
* Catan: Low load enables socializing

**Bad:** Load obstructs the intended feeling

* Complex mechanics in Fellowship game (competes with socializing)
* Deep story requiring homework in Action game (breaks flow)
* Random difficulty in Challenge game (can't learn, frustrating)

**Test:** Does this complexity serve the experience, or get in the way?

***

### Principle 3: Time Pressure Reduces Load Budget

**Real-time games:**

* Must have lower complexity (no time to think)
* Simultaneity becomes primary challenge
* Reactions and patterns over calculation

**Turn-based games:**

* Can have higher complexity (time to process)
* Decisions and depth become primary challenge
* Calculation and optimization possible

**Same mechanics, different time constraints = different experiences.**

**Example:** They Are Billions

* With pause: Complex but manageable optimization puzzle
* Without pause: Overwhelming tension and forced prioritization

***

### Principle 4: Complexity Should Be Learnable

**High load works when:**

* Patterns can be learned through practice
* Complexity is consistent (not arbitrary)
* Mastery is rewarded (skill expression visible)
* Failure teaches (can understand what went wrong)

**High load fails when:**

* Random or inconsistent outcomes
* No feedback on what went wrong
* Complexity is opaque (can't learn patterns)
* Mastery doesn't reduce difficulty

**Learnable complexity = good challenge.**
**Arbitrary complexity = bad frustration.**

***

### Principle 5: Support or Remove Load Intentionally

**For necessary load (serves experience):**

* Provide tools (reference sheets, journals, calculators)
* Design clear UI (make state visible)
* Tutorial gradually (don't overwhelm at start)

**For unnecessary load (obstructs experience):**

* Automate (let system handle bookkeeping)
* Simplify (remove complexity that doesn't add decisions)
* Offload (GM or computer tracks, not players)

**Every bit of load should justify its existence.**

***

## Summary: Load as Instrument, Not Problem

Cognitive load is like volume in music:

* **Too quiet** (low load) = boring, no engagement
* **Too loud** (high load) = overwhelming, painful
* **Just right** (appropriate load) = creates intended experience

But "just right" isn't one level—it's different for:

* Different aesthetics (Fellowship vs. Challenge)
* Different audiences (casual vs. hardcore)
* Different contexts (one-shot vs. campaign)

**The designer's job:** Match load profile to experiential goals.

**Next chapter:** We'll examine specific load types in detail, with game examples showing how each type shapes experience.

***

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cognitive load is a design tool, not a problem to minimize**
2. **Different load profiles create different aesthetic experiences**
3. **High load works for Challenge/Mastery, fails for Fellowship/Narrative**
4. **Low load works for Fellowship/Narrative, fails for Challenge/Mastery**
5. **"Just right" is context-dependent, not universal**
6. **Load must serve the experience, not obstruct it**
7. **Time pressure dramatically reduces load budget**
8. **Learnable complexity is good; arbitrary complexity is bad**
9. **Every bit of load should justify its existence**
10. **Match load profile to aesthetic goal first, then design systems**
