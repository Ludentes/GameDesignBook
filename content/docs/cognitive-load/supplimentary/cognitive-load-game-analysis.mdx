***

## 1. StarCraft (Real-Time Strategy)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Simultaneity Load (Primary):**

* Base management (building workers, structures, tech)
* Army control (positioning, micro, engagement timing)
* Map awareness (scouting, vision, threat detection)
* Resource optimization (spending efficiently, not banking)
* Multiple locations simultaneously (main base, expansions, army positions, drops/harass)

**Decision Load:**

* Build order choices (tech path, unit composition)
* Tactical decisions (engage or retreat, which units to focus)
* Strategic decisions (when to expand, when to attack, when to defend)

**Tracking Load:**

* Enemy army composition and position
* Resource counts (minerals, gas, supply)
* Upgrade status (yours and opponent's)
* Timing windows (when attacks are coming, when you're vulnerable)

**Memory Load (moderate):**

* Build orders for various matchups
* Counter relationships (unit A beats unit B)
* Map layouts and timings

### Load/Skill Relationship

**The "Always More To Do" Principle:**

* The game deliberately creates more actionable decisions than any human can execute
* At ANY skill level, there are inefficiencies to optimize
* Bronze players: overwhelmed by basic macro (forgetting to build workers)
* Masters players: still making imperfect choices about attention allocation
* Professional players: still can't do everything optimally (InControl's observation holds true)

**Skill Expression:**

* **Mechanical efficiency:** Faster execution = more actions per minute
* **Cognitive efficiency:** Better prioritization = right actions at right time
* **Pattern recognition:** Recognizing game states faster = faster decisions
* **Automated routines:** Practiced builds free up attention for adaptation

**Key insight:** Mastery isn't about reducing load to manageable levels—it's about managing impossible load better than opponents.

### Investment & Load

**Time Investment:**

* **Practice reduces execution load:** Build orders become muscle memory
* **Practice reveals deeper load:** As basics automate, you notice more things to optimize
* **Meta knowledge adds load:** Understanding all matchups, timings, cheese strategies

**The Paradox:** Investment both reduces AND increases cognitive load:

* Automation frees up brainspace for higher-level thinking
* But higher-level play reveals previously invisible complexities
* Expert players have MORE to think about, but better tools to think with

**Investment Types:**

* Mechanical practice (APM training, hotkey optimization)
* Strategic study (watching replays, learning builds)
* Pattern recognition (experience with game states)

### Other Constraints (Critical)

**Time Pressure:**

* Real-time means decisions can't be deferred
* Split-second choices under pressure
* No time to calculate optimal play—must rely on intuition/pattern recognition

**Mechanical Execution:**

* Physical APM limits what's possible
* Hand speed becomes a constraint separate from knowledge
* Creates a floor: even if you know what to do, can you execute it?

**Information (Fog of War):**

* Uncertainty about opponent's actions
* Scouting becomes a cognitive load trade-off (spend attention to reduce uncertainty)
* Decision-making under incomplete information

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management Strategies:**

* **Hotkeys & camera locations:** Reduce mechanical overhead
* **Build orders:** Memorized sequences reduce decision load early game
* **"Looking away":** Accepting suboptimal play in one area to focus elsewhere
* **Simplified strategies:** Focusing on macro over micro, or vice versa

**Failure Modes:**

* **Tunnel vision:** Focusing on one fight while losing the game elsewhere
* **Supply blocks:** Forgetting basic tasks under pressure
* **Panic decisions:** Overwhelmed players make reactive, not strategic choices

***

## 2. Warhammer 40,000 (Tabletop Miniatures)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Memory Load (Primary):**

* **Your army rules:** Unit stats, special abilities, weapon profiles, stratagems
* **Opponent's army rules:** What threats exist, what combos to watch for
* **Core rules:** Movement, shooting, combat, morale phases
* **Mission rules:** Objectives, deployment, scoring conditions
* **Interactions:** How rules interact, edge cases, FAQs

**Pre-Game Load:**

* Army list construction (points, detachments, synergies)
* Understanding the meta (what armies/builds are common)
* Knowing your codex deeply enough to make informed choices

**In-Game Decision Load:**

* Target priority (which units to shoot/charge)
* Positioning (threat ranges, objectives, terrain)
* Resource management (command points for stratagems)
* Sequencing (order of activations matters)

**Calculation Load:**

* Dice probabilities (will this attack kill that unit?)
* Measuring distances (ranges, movement, coherency)
* Wound allocation and save rolls

### Load/Skill Relationship

**The "More Rules Than You Can Remember" Principle:**

* Codex creep: each edition adds complexity
* Army-specific rules multiply interactions
* Expert players have encyclopedic rule knowledge
* BUT: Even experts need to reference rulebooks/FAQs

**Skill Expression:**

* **Rules mastery:** Knowing what's possible (combos, tricks, interactions)
* **List building:** Meta knowledge and synergy recognition
* **Tactical execution:** Positioning, target priority, risk assessment
* **Rule lawyering:** Knowing precise wording to resolve disputes

**Key Difference from StarCraft:** Load is frontloaded in knowledge/preparation, not real-time execution.

### Investment & Load

**Money Investment:**

* Buying, building, painting models (time & cost)
* Creates sunk cost: you're invested in playing armies you own
* Collection investment = commitment to learning those specific rules

**Time Investment:**

* Learning your army deeply (weeks/months)
* Staying current with FAQs, erratas, meta shifts
* Investment ADDS load: new codex releases mean relearning rules

**The Preparation Paradox:**

* More preparation = better in-game performance
* But preparation itself is high cognitive load
* Playing casually is extremely high load (don't know the rules well)
* Playing competitively requires encyclopedic knowledge

**Investment Types:**

* Financial (models, books)
* Time (building, painting, learning rules)
* Social (finding opponents, community reputation)

### Load Distribution (Critical)

**Between Players:**

* Both players need to know both armies' rules (or trust opponent's honesty)
* Asymmetric knowledge creates tension: "Are you sure your unit can do that?"
* Rule disputes offload to judge/community/rulebook

**Across Time:**

* Pre-game: List building, rule review, preparation
* In-game: Tactical execution (but still need rules reference)
* Post-game: Learning from mistakes, updating knowledge

### Other Constraints

**Social Constraints:**

* Opponent's patience with rule lookups
* Community expectations (casual vs. competitive play)
* "That guy" reputation if you exploit unclear rules

**Physical Constraints:**

* Table space, measuring tools
* Dice rolling and calculation time
* Model positioning and movement logistics

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management:**

* **Army specialization:** Playing one army deeply rather than many shallowly
* **Cheat sheets:** Reference cards for common stats/rules
* **App usage:** Battlescribe, official apps for quick lookups
* **Simplified builds:** "Take the meta list" to avoid theorycrafting load

**Failure Modes:**

* **Forgetting rules:** Missing special abilities, stratagems
* **Analysis paralysis:** Too many options, can't decide
* **Rules arguments:** Cognitive load during disputes breaks game flow
* **Codex creep exhaustion:** Giving up on keeping current

### Load Appropriateness (Problem)

**Load is barrier to entry:**

* New players face MASSIVE upfront investment
* Can't play casually without significant study
* Rulebook + Codex + FAQs = hundreds of pages

**Load creep over time:**

* Each edition adds complexity
* Power creep in rules means more interactions to track
* Community splits between "it's too complex" and "depth is good"

***

## 3. Dwarf Fortress (Simulation/Management)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Tracking Load (Extreme):**

* Hundreds of dwarves with individual needs, skills, moods
* Dozens of simultaneous production chains
* Multiple z-levels (3D fortress layout)
* Resource stockpiles (food, stone, metal, goods)
* External threats (goblins, forgotten beasts, tantrums)
* Fortress stability (happiness, safety, efficiency)

**Decision Load:**

* Prioritization: what to build/produce next?
* Crisis management: which emergency to handle first?
* Long-term planning: fortress layout, defenses, industry

**Memory Load:**

* Recipes and production chains
* Dwarf skills and professions
* Creature abilities and threats
* Game systems (farming, military, nobles, etc.)

**Interface Load (Unique):**

* ASCII graphics require mental translation
* Complex keybindings (learning the UI is separate skill)
* Menu navigation requires memorization

### Load/Skill Relationship

**The Extreme End of Spectrum:**

* Deliberately ignores cognitive load constraints
* "Losing is fun" - the game expects you to fail from overload
* Skill is about managing chaos, not achieving perfection

**Skill Expression:**

* **Systems mastery:** Understanding cascading failures
* **Prioritization:** Knowing what to ignore safely
* **Pattern recognition:** Spotting problems before they spiral
* **Defensive design:** Building robust systems that survive neglect

**Key Insight:** The game is ABOUT cognitive overload. It's a feature, not a bug.

### Investment & Load

**Time Investment:**

* Hundreds of hours to become competent
* Learning curve is a vertical wall
* Each fortress is dozens of hours of play

**The Learning Paradox:**

* Investment reduces SOME load (UI becomes familiar, systems understood)
* But reveals exponentially MORE complexity (new systems interact in unexpected ways)
* Expert players still get surprised by emergent behavior

**Investment Creates Attachment:**

* Time invested in fortress = emotional investment
* Losing fortress to spiral of doom is devastating but memorable
* "My fortress fell because..." becomes a story

### Load Appropriateness (Intentional Extreme)

**Load is the POINT:**

* The experience is "managing the unmanageable"
* Failure states (tantrum spirals, goblin invasions) are content
* The cognitive overload creates emergent stories

**But Creates Barriers:**

* Ultra-niche appeal (most players bounce off)
* Can't play casually—requires deep commitment
* Community knowledge is essential (wiki-dependent)

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management:**

* **Wiki dependency:** Can't play without external reference
* **Specialization:** Focusing on subset of systems
* **Automation tools:** Third-party utilities to reduce tracking
* **Acceptance:** Letting some things fail/ignoring problems

**Failure Modes:**

* **Cascade failures:** One problem creates six more
* **Overwhelm quit:** Just stopping play when too complex
* **"Fun" deaths:** Fortress collapses spectacularly

***

## 4. Chess

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Decision Load (Primary):**

* Evaluating candidate moves (typically 3-5 serious options)
* Calculating variations (if I do X, opponent does Y, then I do Z...)
* Depth of calculation scales with skill (beginners: 1-2 moves; masters: 10+ moves)

**Pattern Recognition Load:**

* Recognizing positions (openings, endgames, tactical motifs)
* Board vision (seeing forks, pins, skewers instantly)
* Positional judgment (which position is better and why?)

**Memory Load (Scales with Skill):**

* Opening theory (memorized sequences)
* Endgame tablebase knowledge
* Classic games and positions

**Calculation Load:**

* Counting material
* Evaluating exchanges
* Calculating forced sequences

### Load/Skill Relationship

**Simple Rules, Infinite Depth:**

* Rules can be learned in minutes
* Cognitive load comes entirely from decision complexity, not rule complexity
* Skill ceiling is essentially unlimited

**Load Scales Dramatically with Skill:**

* **Beginners:** Overwhelmed by options, see nothing clearly
* **Intermediate:** Pattern recognition reduces load, but reveals deeper complexity
* **Masters:** Chunk large patterns, calculate deeper, but still face enormous decision space

**Skill Expression:**

* **Pattern recognition:** Grandmasters "see" board differently (chunks not pieces)
* **Calculation efficiency:** Pruning bad variations quickly
* **Intuition:** Positional judgment that bypasses calculation
* **Opening preparation:** Moving load to memorization

### Investment & Load

**Time Investment:**

* Practice compresses load through pattern recognition
* Studying openings moves cognitive load to preparation phase
* Endgame study converts calculation to memorized knowledge

**The Chunking Effect:**

* Expert players see "knight outpost" not "knight on e5 with pawns on d6, f6"
* Pattern recognition MASSIVELY reduces in-game load
* But requires thousands of hours to develop

**Investment Types:**

* Studying games/positions
* Playing practice games
* Opening preparation
* Endgame drilling

**The Plateau Effect:**

* Early investment yields rapid load reduction
* Advanced investment reveals new dimensions of complexity
* Diminishing returns but never-ending depth

### Other Constraints (Minimal)

**Time (in timed games):**

* Clock pressure forces decisions under cognitive load
* Time management becomes separate skill
* Faster time controls = higher pressure, more errors

**Perfect Information:**

* No hidden information reduces memory load
* All complexity is visible, nothing to track secretly
* Makes decision load the dominant constraint

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management:**

* **Opening memorization:** Reduce early-game decision load
* **Time management:** Spending more time on critical positions
* **Heuristics:** "Knights before bishops" type rules to shortcut decisions
* **Resignation:** Recognizing when load of defense exceeds chance of success

**Failure Modes:**

* **Time pressure blunders:** Errors under clock pressure
* **Calculation errors:** Missing a tactic in a complex position
* **Overwhelm:** Facing a position too complex to calculate

***

## 5. Dark Souls (Action RPG)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Pattern Recognition Load (Primary):**

* Enemy attack patterns (wind-ups, timings, tells)
* Boss movesets (learning through repetition)
* Environmental hazards (traps, ambushes, terrain)

**Spatial Awareness Load:**

* Camera management (keeping enemies visible)
* Positioning (spacing, terrain advantages)
* Stamina management (can I dodge/attack now?)

**Decision Load (Moderate):**

* Build choices (stats, equipment, upgrades)
* Route planning (which areas in what order?)
* Risk assessment (push forward or go back to bonfire?)

**Memory Load (Low-Medium):**

* Area layouts (where are bonfires, shortcuts?)
* Enemy locations (ambush points)
* Item locations

### Load/Skill Relationship

**"Learning by Dying":**

* Death is the primary teaching mechanism
* Each death adds information: "That enemy does THAT attack"
* Cognitive load DECREASES as you die more (pattern internalization)

**From Overwhelming to Trivial:**

* First encounter: high load, chaotic, reactive
* After practice: low load, predictive, controlled
* Expert players make it look effortless (have internalized all patterns)

**Skill Expression:**

* **Pattern mastery:** Reacting instinctively to tells
* **Resource management:** Stamina, healing, equipment durability
* **Risk tolerance:** Pushing further before resting
* **Build optimization:** Understanding stat/equipment synergies

**Key Insight:** Game front-loads cognitive load (early game is brutal), then REDUCES it through enforced practice (death).

### Investment & Load

**Time Investment:**

* Dying repeatedly is mandatory
* Each death reduces future cognitive load (learned a pattern)
* Investment is painful but directly reduces difficulty

**The "Git Gud" Curve:**

* Investment creates competence through internalized patterns
* Unlike StarCraft (load never disappears), Dark Souls load goes DOWN
* Mastery feels like going from "impossible" to "easy"

**Investment Creates Satisfaction:**

* The pain of learning makes victory meaningful
* "I beat that boss" = "I mastered that pattern set"
* Dark Souls invests you through making you work for every inch

**Investment Types:**

* Time (repeated attempts)
* Patience (accepting death as learning)
* Mental effort (pattern recognition training)

### Other Constraints (Critical)

**Time Pressure (Combat):**

* Real-time combat doesn't allow deep calculation
* Must rely on internalized patterns and reflexes
* Hesitation = death

**Mechanical Execution:**

* Timing precision (roll i-frames, parry windows)
* Input buffering (game queues inputs, can cause errors)
* Physical stamina (long boss fights test endurance)

**Punishment for Failure:**

* Death means losing progress (souls, position)
* Creates emotional pressure separate from cognitive load
* Risk/reward decisions under stress

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management:**

* **Route memorization:** Knowing safe paths through areas
* **Slow, methodical exploration:** Reducing surprise/ambush load
* **Summons/co-op:** Distributing combat load across players
* **Grinding:** Over-leveling to reduce execution demands

**Failure Modes:**

* **Panic rolling:** Overwhelmed by pattern, random dodges
* **Tilting:** Emotional frustration breaks pattern recognition
* **Giving up:** Load feels insurmountable (but is actually conquerable)

**Success Patterns:**

* **Calm repetition:** Treating deaths as data collection
* **Pattern exploitation:** Once learned, executing perfectly
* **Flow state:** Mastered content becomes meditative

### Load Appropriateness (Intentional Design)

**Load is weaponized, then removed:**

* Initial difficulty is brutal (high load, no knowledge)
* But game TEACHES through repetition
* Mastery feels earned because load was overcome, not reduced by developer

**The Accessibility Debate:**

* Some players bounce off the initial load wall
* Community debates "easy mode" (would reduce investment/satisfaction loop?)
* Load barrier is part of the identity

***

## 6. Wordle (Daily Word Puzzle)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Decision Load (Minimal):**

* Choose 5-letter word
* Evaluate feedback (green/yellow/gray letters)
* Narrow possibilities based on information

**Pattern Recognition:**

* Common letter frequencies
* Word patterns (common combinations)
* Vowel placement

**Memory Load (Very Low):**

* Remembering previous guesses in current puzzle
* (That's it—no persistent knowledge needed)

### Load/Skill Relationship

**Deliberately Low Load:**

* Simple rules, quick to learn
* No deep mastery required
* Skill ceiling exists but is low (optimal starting words, efficient narrowing)

**Skill Expression (Limited):**

* Starting word choice
* Efficiency in narrowing possibilities
* Avoiding repeated letters

**Key Insight:** Low load is the POINT. The game is accessible, not challenging.

### Investment & Load

**Time Investment (Minimal):**

* One puzzle per day
* 5 minutes or less
* No practice needed between puzzles

**Ritual Investment:**

* Daily habit (coffee + Wordle)
* Social sharing (comparing scores)
* Streak maintenance (don't break the chain)

**Investment is Social/Temporal, Not Skill:**

* You don't "get better" at Wordle meaningfully
* Investment is in the HABIT, not mastery
* Emotional investment in maintaining streak

### Other Constraints (Critical)

**Artificial Time Constraint:**

* One puzzle per day (arbitrary limitation)
* Can't binge-play
* Scarcity creates value

**Social Constraint:**

* Everyone gets same puzzle
* Results are comparable (shared experience)
* Creates conversation topic

### Load Appropriateness (Perfect Match)

**Load matches intent:**

* Casual, accessible daily ritual
* Low barrier to entry
* Doesn't demand cognitive investment

**Success from constraint, not complexity:**

* The ONE PER DAY rule is what makes it work
* If you could play infinite Wordles, it would be boring
* Scarcity creates investment despite low load

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management (Unnecessary):**

* Game is low enough load that no management needed
* Some players optimize starting words, but it's optional

**Social Behaviors:**

* Sharing scores on social media
* Discussing strategy with friends
* Competitive comparison (who solved faster/fewer guesses)

***

## 7. Cookie Clicker (Idle Game)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Decision Load (Extremely Low in Active Play):**

* Click cookie → get cookies
* Spend cookies on upgrades
* Optimize purchase order (slightly)

**Strategic Load (Low, Intermittent):**

* Which upgrades to buy in what order?
* When to ascend/prestige?
* Long-term planning for achievements

**Tracking Load (Minimal Active, High Passive):**

* Game tracks everything automatically
* You just check in periodically

### Load/Skill Relationship

**Inverted Skill Model:**

* Less skill, more patience
* Optimal play is WAITING, not executing
* "Skill" is patience and long-term optimization

**Skill Expression (Minimal):**

* Upgrade purchase optimization
* Ascension timing
* Achievement hunting strategy

**Key Insight:** The game removes cognitive load almost entirely. It's ANTI-load.

### Investment & Load

**Time Investment (Passive):**

* Game plays itself
* Investment is DURATION, not attention
* Checking in periodically over days/weeks

**The Waiting Game:**

* You can't speedrun through effort
* Investment is patience, not skill
* Progress is time-gated by design

**Investment Creates Sunk Cost:**

* Days/weeks of idle progress
* Creates attachment despite minimal active engagement
* Hard to quit when you've "invested" so much time

**Comparison to Dark Souls:**

* Dark Souls: High effort investment → load reduction
* Cookie Clicker: Time investment → progression (load was never there)

### Other Constraints (Critical)

**Time Constraint (Artificial):**

* Progress is rate-limited
* Can't "work harder" to go faster
* Must wait for passive income

**Attention Constraint (Inverted):**

* Game punishes constant attention (inefficient clicking)
* Rewards ignoring it (passive income)
* Playing "correctly" means NOT playing

### Load Appropriateness (Deliberate Anti-Design)

**Load absence is the point:**

* Satisfies completion urges without demanding attention
* "Play" while doing other things
* Numbers go up without effort

**The Idle Game Paradox:**

* Is this even a game? (minimal decisions, minimal interaction)
* Appeals to different psychology (progression, not challenge)
* Load is almost entirely removed—investment is just time passage

### Observable Behaviors

**"Playing":**

* Checking in once an hour/day
* Leaving tab open in background
* Automating with scripts (accepted/encouraged)

**Optimization:**

* Spreadsheets for optimal upgrade paths (external cognitive load!)
* Community wikis for strategies
* The GAME has no load, but optimization creates optional load

***

## 8. Among Us (Social Deduction)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Social Deduction Load (Primary):**

* Tracking player behavior (who was where, when?)
* Detecting lies and inconsistencies
* Reading tone, body language (if voice chat)
* Building trust or suspicion

**Memory Load (Critical):**

* Remembering who claimed to do what task
* Recalling alibis and accusations
* Tracking voting patterns across rounds

**Decision Load:**

* As Crewmate: Who to trust? Who to vote?
* As Impostor: Who to kill? How to lie convincingly? When to sabotage?

**Real-Time Tracking:**

* Visual memory (saw player X in hallway)
* Task completion (are they faking tasks?)

### Load/Skill Relationship

**Social Skill as Cognitive Load:**

* Better social skills = better load management
* Reading people requires attention and processing
* Lying convincingly is cognitive work

**Skill Expression:**

* **Information synthesis:** Connecting clues across rounds
* **Persuasion:** Convincing others of your theory
* **Deception:** (As Impostor) creating believable cover story
* **Attention management:** Noticing details others miss

**Skill Varies by Role:**

* Crewmate: Detective work (collecting information)
* Impostor: Performance work (creating false narrative)

### Investment & Load

**Social Investment:**

* Game is better with familiar group
* In-jokes, reputation, history create context
* Playing with strangers is higher load (no baseline trust)

**Meta-Knowledge:**

* Learning tells (player X always does Y when lying)
* Map knowledge (optimal task routes, vent locations)
* Strategy knowledge (common Impostor tactics)

**Reputation Investment:**

* Being "good at the game" is social capital
* Trustworthiness across games matters
* Losing reputation hurts future games

### Load Distribution (Critical)

**Distributed Memory:**

* No one player can track everything
* Discussion phase pools information
* Group collectively reconstructs events

**Asymmetric Load:**

* Impostor has much higher cognitive load (lying, covering tracks, faking tasks)
* Crewmates can be passive (just do tasks)
* Active crewmates take on detective load voluntarily

### Other Constraints

**Time Pressure:**

* Limited discussion time
* Must synthesize information quickly
* Voting deadline forces decision under uncertainty

**Information Limits:**

* Don't see everything (limited vision)
* Don't know others' roles
* Uncertainty is core mechanic

**Social Pressure:**

* Being suspected is stressful
* Defending yourself under time pressure
* Group dynamics (bandwagoning, leadership)

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management:**

* **Note-taking:** Some players write down alibis/movements
* **Focusing on subset:** Only tracking suspicious players
* **Following the crowd:** Reducing decision load by trusting majority

**Failure Modes:**

* **Information overload:** Too many claims to track
* **Tunnel vision:** Fixating on one suspect, ignoring evidence
* **Panic voting:** Time runs out, random vote

**Social Dynamics:**

* **Dominant voices:** Some players guide discussion, reducing others' load
* **Quiet players:** Overlooked or suspected (different load strategies)

### Load Appropriateness

**Load is well-tuned:**

* Manageable for casual play (can participate without being detective)
* Depth for engaged players (tracking details, building cases)
* Scales with group engagement

**But:**

* Very high load for Impostors (some players avoid the role)
* Toxic behavior can increase social/emotional load
* Communication barriers (language, voice vs. text) affect load

***

## 9. Death Stranding (Open World Delivery Game)

### Core Cognitive Load Types

**Navigation Load:**

* Route planning across difficult terrain
* Balancing cargo weight and stability
* Terrain reading (slopes, rivers, obstacles)
* Tool selection (ladders, ropes, vehicles)

**Inventory Management Load:**

* Cargo organization and weight distribution
* Equipment selection for journey
* Resource management (stamina, tools, vehicles)

**Stealth/Combat Load (When Present):**

* BT (ghost) avoidance patterns
* Enemy encounter management
* But these are RARE compared to traversal

**Meta-System Load:**

* Online structures (what to build/use?)
* Likes system (social optimization)
* Story/lore tracking (convoluted plot)

### Load/Skill Relationship

**Load Mismatch:**

* Core loop (walking) is LOW cognitive load
* But surrounded by COMPLEX systems
* Meditative traversal interrupted by menu management

**Skill Expression:**

* Route optimization (finding best paths)
* Physics mastery (balancing, momentum)
* Infrastructure planning (building roads, structures)
* Time management (balancing deliveries)

**The Polarization:**

* Some players find traversal meditative (low load = relaxing)
* Some players find traversal boring (low load = unstimulating)
* Complex systems feel either deep or intrusive

### Investment & Load

**Time Investment:**

* Slow gameplay (travel takes real time)
* Investment through patience and repetition
* World-building investment (structures help all players)

**The Two Games Problem:**

* Game A: Meditative walking simulator (low load)
* Game B: Complex menu/crafting/story management (high load)
* Investment in one doesn't help with the other

**Investment Types:**

* Time (long journeys)
* Infrastructure (building roads, signs, structures)
* Story engagement (if you care about plot)
* Social (contributing to community infrastructure)

### Load Appropriateness (The Problem)

**Load Mismatch is CORE ISSUE:**

* Traversal gameplay suggests meditative, low-load experience
* But systems layer suggests optimization/management game
* Story complexity suggests narrative focus
* These don't harmonize—they compete for attention

**Different Players, Different Loads:**

* Player A: "I just want to walk and relax" → annoyed by complex systems
* Player B: "I want deep systems" → bored by walking
* Player C: "I want story" → frustrated by gameplay interruptions

**Observable Split:**

* Some players love it (load mismatch creates unique experience)
* Some players hate it (load mismatch creates frustration)
* Very few are neutral

### Other Constraints

**Time (Real-Time Travel):**

* Journeys take minutes/hours of real time
* Can't speed up significantly
* Creates investment through time sink

**Physical Simulation:**

* Balance mechanics require attention
* Terrain traversal is physics-based
* Creates moment-to-moment load despite simple goal

### Observable Behaviors

**Load Management:**

* **Hyperfocus on optimization:** Planning perfect routes, building roads
* **Ignoring systems:** Just walk, ignore complex crafting/story
* **Podcast gaming:** Low traversal load means playing while listening to other content

**Polarized Responses:**

* "This is genius/meditative/unique"
* "This is boring/tedious/pretentious"
* Very little middle ground

**Failure Modes:**

* **Boredom:** Traversal load too low, systems too intrusive
* **Overwhelm:** Systems too complex for "walking simulator"
* **Quit:** Load mismatch feels unsatisfying either way

### Load Appropriateness (Unique Case)

**Intentional Mismatch?**

* Kojima might be DELIBERATELY creating friction
* The "game" is in the tension between simple traversal and complex systems
* Or it's just bad design—community is split

**What Can We Learn?**

* Load mismatch can create polarization
* Different load types need to harmonize or clearly separate
* Meditative gameplay and complex systems fight for attention
* Audience expectations matter (people expected action game, got walking game)

* Among Us (collaborative deduction)
* Warhammer (community knowledge sharing)
* May prefer games where load can be shared

**Killers → Competitive Load Management:**

* StarCraft (better load management = victory)
* Chess (outthinking opponent)
* Load is weapon against opponent

**Key Insight:** Different player types may have different load tolerances and preferences. A game's cognitive load profile attracts/repels different Bartle types.

## Open Questions for Further Research

1. **Is there an optimal cognitive load curve?** (How should load change from beginner to expert?)

2. **Can load mismatch ever be intentional and successful?** (Death Stranding is polarizing—but is that bad?)

3. **How do we measure cognitive load empirically?** (Self-report? Performance metrics? Physiological measures?)

4. **What's the relationship between load and flow state?** (Csikszentmihalyi's work on optimal challenge)

5. **Can LLMs help manage cognitive load?** (Dynamically adjusting complexity? Providing just-in-time information?)

6. **How does social load differ from solo cognitive load?** (Among Us vs. StarCraft)

7. **What role does aesthetic/UI design play in cognitive load?** (Dwarf Fortress ASCII vs. modern UIs)

8. **How do different constraints interact?** (Time pressure + high decision load = stress; fog of war + tracking load = uncertainty)

9. **What makes load feel fair vs. unfair?** (Dark Souls vs. "fake difficulty")

10. **How does cognitive load relate to accessibility?** (Can games be high-load but still accessible? What about cognitive disabilities?)
