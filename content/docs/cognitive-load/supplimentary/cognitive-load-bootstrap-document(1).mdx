## Purpose of This Document

This document consolidates all discussions about cognitive load, brainspace, and design constraints from our resource management brainstorming sessions. It serves as the foundation for creating a new chapter on this topic.

**What this document contains:**

1. Core concepts and definitions
2. All examples and analyses discussed
3. Patterns and insights identified
4. What we still need to cover
5. Proposed structure for the chapter

**Status:** Bootstrap/planning document - not yet formalized into chapter

***

## Part 1: Core Concepts and Definitions

### The Fundamental Distinction

**Critical insight from resource management discussions:**

Cognitive load is NOT a resource - it's a constraint.

**Resources are:**

* In-game mechanical entities (HP, gold, spell slots)
* Tracked by game system
* Can be spent, recovered, traded
* Create strategic choices through explicit mechanics
* Part of game state

**Cognitive load is:**

* Player mental capacity/constraint
* External to game state
* Can't be "spent" or "recovered" within game
* Designer accommodates it in design choices
* Like session length, player time, emotional safety

**Why the distinction matters:**

* Tools for resources (scarcity, recovery, spending) don't apply to constraints
* Constraints shape what resource designs are feasible
* Calling everything a "resource" creates confusion

### What Is Cognitive Load?

**Definition:** The mental effort required to play the game - tracking information, making decisions, calculating outcomes, remembering rules.

**Components of cognitive load:**

1. **Tracking** - Remembering game state (what resources you have, what happened)
2. **Calculation** - Computing outcomes (damage, probabilities, optimal moves)
3. **Decision-making** - Evaluating options and choosing actions
4. **Rule knowledge** - Remembering how systems work
5. **Pattern recognition** - Seeing strategies and interactions
6. **Attention management** - What to focus on in real-time

### Brainspace as Metaphor

**"Brainspace"** is shorthand for cognitive capacity - the mental "room" players have available.

**The pro player quote that crystallized this:**

> "I find StarCraft interesting because there are always more things to do than can be done by a human. I find tabletop Warhammer interesting because there are always more rules than can be remembered by a player."

**Translation:** Skill in these games comes from optimization under cognitive constraints.

**The They Are Billions competitive example:**

* Single-player: Can pause and optimize sawmill placement perfectly
* Competitive (no pause): "Good enough now" beats "perfect in 10 seconds"
* Main resource is brainspace/time, not in-game resources

### Types of Constraints vs. Resources

**Constraints (external to game):**

* Player cognitive capacity (brainspace)
* Player time availability (session length)
* Player attention span (can't focus forever)
* Player emotional bandwidth (can handle only so much stress)
* Physical limitations (APM in real-time games, accessibility needs)

**Resources (internal to game):**

* HP, gold, ammunition, spell slots
* Everything we covered in Resource Management chapter

**The relationship:**

* Constraints determine what resource systems are feasible
* Complex resource tracking increases cognitive load
* Must balance: resource depth vs. player capacity

**Design question:** "Is this resource worth the cognitive overhead it creates?"

***

## Part 2: Cognitive Load and Aesthetic Experience

### Key Insight: Cognitive Load Is a Design Tool

Cognitive load isn't just a problem to minimize - it's a tool for creating specific experiences.

**Different cognitive load profiles create different aesthetics:**

#### 2.1: Flow State (Optimal Cognitive Load)

**Experience:** "I'm in the zone, everything clicks, time disappears"

**Characteristics:**

* Challenge matches skill level
* Feedback is immediate and clear
* Attention is fully engaged but not overwhelmed

**Examples:**

* Tetris at your skill level
* Slay the Spire when you see the winning combination
* StarCraft when microing perfectly

**Design requirements:**

* Appropriate difficulty scaling
* Clear feedback loops
* Progressive challenge increase

**Serves aesthetics:** Challenge, Mastery, Tension

#### 2.2: Mastery Fantasy (Learnable Complexity)

**Experience:** "I understand this system deeply, I can see patterns others miss"

**Characteristics:**

* High complexity but masterable
* Rewards study and practice
* Pattern recognition develops over time
* Clear cause-effect relationships

**Examples:**

* Chess middlegame tactics
* Magic: The Gathering card interactions
* D\&D 3.5e character optimization
* Go pattern recognition

**Design requirements:**

* Consistent rules (can be learned)
* Transparent mechanics (can understand why)
* Depth that reveals itself over time

**Serves aesthetics:** Mastery, Challenge

#### 2.3: Overwhelm (Excessive Cognitive Load)

**Experience:** "I don't know what to do, analysis paralysis, stressed"

**Characteristics:**

* Too many options simultaneously
* Unclear consequences
* Time pressure + complexity
* Can't process all information

**Examples:**

* Warhammer 40K for new players (hundreds of rules)
* Civ IV late game (too many cities to manage)
* They Are Billions first playthrough (everything at once)
* Complex strategy games without tutorial

**This is usually BAD DESIGN** (unintended overwhelm)

**Exception:** Some games intentionally overwhelm (horror games, intentional chaos)

#### 2.4: Ease/Accessibility (Minimal Cognitive Load)

**Experience:** "I can just play, don't need to think hard, relaxing"

**Characteristics:**

* Simple rules, clear choices
* Forgiving of mistakes
* Low complexity
* Minimal tracking

**Examples:**

* Modern D\&D 5e (advantage/disadvantage, simple math)
* Catan (5 resources, clear costs)
* Casual mobile games
* Party games

**Design requirements:**

* Minimize tracking
* Simplify decision space
* Clear signaling of options

**Serves aesthetics:** Fellowship (brainspace for socializing), Submission (relaxation)

#### 2.5: Tension (Time Pressure + Stakes)

**Experience:** "Must decide NOW, no time to optimize, heart racing"

**Characteristics:**

* Real-time pressure
* Consequences for delay
* Forced prioritization
* Adrenaline response

**Examples:**

* StarCraft battles (must act quickly)
* They Are Billions competitive (no pause)
* XCOM Ironman with timers
* Speed chess

**Design requirements:**

* Real-time systems OR strict time limits
* Clear stakes (what happens if you fail)
* Manageable even under pressure

**Serves aesthetics:** Tension, Challenge (different kind than turn-based)

#### 2.6: Zen/Intuition (Pattern Recognition Over Calculation)

**Experience:** "I feel the right move, can't explain why, artistic/intuitive"

**Characteristics:**

* Too complex to calculate fully
* Rely on pattern recognition and intuition
* Aesthetic judgment over mathematical optimization
* Develops "feel" for good play

**Examples:**

* Go (reading shapes, feeling territory)
* Blades in the Dark (fiction-first, not calculation)
* Jazz improvisation (music parallel)
* Poker tells (reading opponents)

**Design requirements:**

* Complexity beyond calculation
* Reward intuition development
* Clear feedback for learning

**Serves aesthetics:** Mastery (different kind), Expression, Discovery

### Mapping to MDA Aesthetics

**Sensation (sensory pleasure):**

* Cognitive load: LOW (don't want to think, just feel)
* Examples: Rhythm games, walking simulators
* Design: Minimize mental effort, maximize sensory input

**Fantasy (make-believe):**

* Cognitive load: LOW-MEDIUM (immersion requires not too much calculation)
* Examples: Narrative RPGs, immersive sims
* Design: Mechanics fade into background
* **Critical:** Too much calculation breaks fantasy

**Narrative (drama/story):**

* Cognitive load: LOW (story flow disrupted by complex mechanics)
* Examples: PbtA games, visual novels, story games
* Design: Simple mechanics that serve story
* Mechanics should be invisible

**Challenge (obstacle course):**

* Cognitive load: HIGH (that's the point!)
* Examples: Chess, StarCraft, Dark Souls, puzzle games
* Design: Optimization puzzle, skill expression
* **Brainspace IS the challenge**

**Fellowship (social framework):**

* Cognitive load: LOW (focus on people, not rules)
* Examples: Party games, social deduction, Catan
* Design: Simple enough to talk while playing
* **Critical:** Complex mechanics reduce social time

**Discovery (exploration):**

* Cognitive load: MEDIUM (need to process new info, but not overwhelming)
* Examples: Exploration games, mysteries
* Design: Can parse new information at reasonable pace
* **Balance:** Complex enough to be interesting, simple enough to parse

**Expression (self-discovery/creativity):**

* Cognitive load: VARIES
  * Low: Freeform play, improvisational
  * High: Optimization as art, build crafting
* Examples: Character creators, sandbox games
* Design: Depends on type of expression

**Submission (pastime/mindless fun):**

* Cognitive load: VERY LOW (explicitly the point)
* Examples: Idle games, casual mobile, "turn brain off" games
* Design: Minimal demands, routine, comforting

**Additional aesthetics:**

**Mastery (system understanding):**

* Cognitive load: HIGH (learning the system IS the goal)
* Examples: Optimization games, competitive games
* Design: Depth to discover, patterns to learn

**Tension (time pressure/stakes):**

* Cognitive load: HIGH but time-constrained
* Examples: Real-time strategy, action games
* Design: Pressure through limited time to think

**Progression (growth/advancement):**

* Cognitive load: LOW-MEDIUM (want to feel growth, not struggle with system)
* Examples: RPG leveling, incremental games
* Design: Clear advancement, satisfying growth

***

## Part 3: Real-Time vs. Turn-Based

### The Fundamental Split

**Key insight:** Time pressure is a fundamental design choice that creates entirely different cognitive profiles.

### Turn-Based (Infinite Thinking Time)

**Characteristics:**

* Can think as long as you want
* No APM (actions per minute) pressure
* Can calculate optimal moves
* Complexity budget is larger

**Examples:**

* Chess, Go, Checkers
* Slay the Spire
* XCOM (with saves)
* Civ (with no turn timer)
* HoMM3

**Creates:**

* Mastery through calculation
* Deep strategic thinking
* Pattern recognition
* Optimization is possible

**Serves aesthetics:** Challenge (strategic), Mastery, Discovery

**Design implications:**

* Can have more complex systems (players have time to parse)
* Must prevent analysis paralysis (too many options)
* Skill = seeing optimal lines through complexity

### Real-Time (Time Pressure)

**Characteristics:**

* Must act quickly
* APM matters (physical execution)
* Can't calculate perfectly
* Complexity budget is limited

**Examples:**

* StarCraft, RTS games
* Action games
* They Are Billions competitive
* Speed chess
* Timed XCOM

**Creates:**

* Tension through time pressure
* Skill through prioritization
* "Good enough now" beats "perfect later"
* Physical execution matters

**Serves aesthetics:** Tension, Challenge (different kind), Sensation

**Design implications:**

* Must keep systems simpler (less time to think)
* Prioritization becomes core skill
* Physical execution (APM) affects play
* Information must be quickly parseable

### The They Are Billions Example

**Same game, different time model:**

**Single-player (can pause):**

* Optimization puzzle
* Can calculate perfect sawmill placement
* Discovery aesthetic (exploring mechanics)
* Time to think through decisions

**Competitive (no pause allowed):**

* Time pressure changes everything
* "Good enough now" is optimal
* Brainspace becomes the limiting resource
* Must prioritize what to optimize

**Lesson:** Time pressure fundamentally changes the cognitive game being played.

### Hybrid Models

**Some games mix approaches:**

**Pause-with-orders (Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate):**

* Real-time normally
* Can pause to issue complex commands
* Combines action with tactics

**Turn-based with time pressure (Invisible Inc, Into the Breach):**

* Turn-based structure
* But pressure to complete quickly (turn limits, escalating threats)
* Best of both (thinking time + urgency)

**Phase-based (Civ multiplayer, XCOM 2):**

* Simultaneous turns with time limit
* Everyone acts at once (real-time feel)
* Within time limit (turn-based planning)

***

## Part 4: Complexity as Design Tool

### Complexity Sweet Spots: The Chess/Go/Checkers Analysis

**Three games showing complexity ladder:**

#### Checkers: Solved (Too Simple)

**Characteristics:**

* Perfect information, deterministic
* Limited complexity (8x8, simple moves)
* **COMPLETELY SOLVED** (Chinook, 2007)

**Cognitive load:** LOW - humans can see most of game tree

**Result:**

* Once solved, no meaningful decisions remain
* "Skill" becomes memorizing solved lines
* Ceases to be interesting at high level

**Lesson:** Too little complexity → solvable → boring for experts

#### Chess: Deep But Bounded (Just Right)

**Characteristics:**

* Perfect information, deterministic
* Moderate complexity (64 squares, 6 piece types)
* **NOT SOLVED** but extensively analyzed

**Cognitive load:** MEDIUM-HIGH

* Humans can see 5-10 moves ahead
* Computers see much further
* Opening theory + middle game + endgame

**Result:**

* Complex enough to resist solving
* Skill ceiling very high but humans can approach it
* Decades of play still reveal new ideas
* Top humans play near-optimal (within computer bounds)

**Lesson:** Right complexity for human competition - deep enough to explore, not so deep as to be incomprehensible

#### Go: Combinatorial Explosion (Supremely Complex)

**Characteristics:**

* Perfect information, deterministic
* HIGH complexity (19×19 = 361 positions, simple rules)
* **RECENTLY "SOLVED" AT TOP LEVEL** (AlphaGo 2016) but not completely

**Cognitive load:** EXTREME

* Game tree too large for calculation
* More positions than atoms in universe
* Humans rely on intuition, pattern recognition, "shape"

**Result:**

* Brainspace utterly insufficient for analysis
* Skill = intuition + patterns, not calculation
* Even after AlphaGo, humans don't fully understand optimal play
* Creates different aesthetic (artistic vs. analytical)

**Why Go resisted computers longer:**

* Chess: Tactical (calculation-heavy) → brute force worked
* Go: Strategic (pattern-heavy) → needed neural nets/learning

**Lesson:** Extreme complexity creates different cognitive mode (intuition over calculation)

### The Goldilocks Principle

**Too simple (Checkers):**

* Solvable
* Skill ceiling too low
* Becomes execution once "solved"

**Just right (Chess):**

* Deep but approachable
* Humans can compete at high level
* Skill ceiling very high
* Decades of discovery remain

**Too complex for calculation (Go):**

* Beyond human analysis
* Different cognitive mode (intuition vs. calculation)
* Can be strength (creates aesthetic experience)
* Or weakness (can't verify good play without computer)

**Design implication:** Match complexity to intended cognitive experience

### "Skill Through Impossibility" Pattern

**Pattern identified:** Some games create skill by making optimal play literally impossible.

**StarCraft example:**

* More actions available than can be executed (APM limit)
* More information than can be processed (multiple fronts)
* Optimal play is known but humanly impossible
* **Skill = prioritization under constraints**

**Warhammer 40K example:**

* More rules than can be remembered
* Hundreds of unit interactions
* Knowing relevant rules IS skill
* But also creates "gotcha" moments (rules lawyer problem)

**They Are Billions competitive:**

* No pause = must decide quickly
* Can't optimize everything
* Prioritization becomes skill

**This is DIFFERENT from:**

* Execution skill (Dark Souls: difficult but doable)
* Knowledge skill (Chess: complex but finite)
* Strategic skill (Poker: probability calculation)

**Design consideration:**

* Intentional (StarCraft, Go) creates unique skill expression
* Unintentional (Warhammer complexity creep) creates frustration
* Key difference: Is impossibility elegant or messy?

***

## Part 5: Offloading and Simplification Strategies

### Where Can Complexity Live?

**Three places complexity can exist:**

#### 5.1: Player-Facing (Must Track/Remember)

**Examples:**

* Chess positions (must see and evaluate)
* Slay the Spire deck contents (must track)
* Resource pools (must manage)

**Implications:**

* Directly affects cognitive load
* Limits how complex you can be
* Must be worth the mental effort

**Good for:**

* Challenge/Mastery aesthetics (thinking IS the point)
* Turn-based games (time to process)
* When tracking creates decisions

**Bad for:**

* Fellowship (reduces social time)
* Narrative (breaks immersion)
* Real-time games (no time to process)

#### 5.2: GM/Referee-Facing (Offloaded to Human)

**Examples:**

* Blades: GM tracks world state, clocks, NPCs
* D\&D: GM knows monster stats, adjudicates rules
* PbtA: GM follows principles, tracks fictional positioning

**Implications:**

* Removes load from players
* Players focus on decisions, not bookkeeping
* GM absorbs complexity on behalf of group

**Advantages:**

* Can have complex world state (GM manages it)
* Players engage with fiction, not mechanics
* Social/narrative focus enabled

**Disadvantages:**

* GM cognitive load (GM can be overwhelmed)
* Requires skilled GM
* Limits scalability (need human GM)

**Design consideration:** "What should players track vs. what should GM track?"

#### 5.3: Computer-Facing (Automated)

**Examples:**

* Video games calculate damage, track stats
* Modifiers computed automatically
* State persistence (saves)
* Complex rules enforced automatically

**Implications:**

* Zero cognitive load for tracking
* Can have very complex systems
* Players see results, not calculation

**Advantages:**

* Can be extremely complex (computer doesn't care)
* Perfect consistency (no errors)
* Instant feedback
* State management automatic

**Disadvantages:**

* Can become black box (don't understand why)
* Loss of transparency
* Potential for confusion if opaque

**Design consideration:** "What should be automated vs. what should be visible?"

### Simplification Techniques

**From System Evolution Lessons:**

#### Technique 1: Fewer Resource Types

**Problem:** Too many currencies/resources (WoW expansions)
**Solution:** Consolidate (modern WoW)

**Guideline:**

* 3-5 resource types: Manageable for most
* 6-10: Significant attention required
* 10+: Overwhelming for most players

**Catan example:** 5 resources, can hold in head while socializing

#### Technique 2: Unified Mechanics

**Problem:** Different systems for similar things (AD\&D)
**Solution:** Single resolution mechanic (3e d20 system)

**D\&D 5e advantage/disadvantage:**

* Replaces: +2/-2 modifiers, stacking bonuses, circumstance tracking
* One simple rule: Roll twice, take higher/lower
* Eliminates calculation, preserves feel

**Lesson:** Simple core mechanic, complex application

#### Technique 3: Spatial vs. Numerical Complexity

**From System Evolution L4:**
"Spatial/visual complexity > numerical complexity"

**Examples:**

* Civ VI: District placement (visual puzzle) vs. Civ IV specialist optimization (spreadsheet)
* XCOM: Cover positioning (visual) vs. Time Unit calculation (numerical)

**Players prefer tangible to abstract**

**Design implication:** Make complexity visible/spatial when possible

#### Technique 4: Guided Complexity

**Problem:** Too many options, analysis paralysis
**Solution:** Guide players toward good choices

**Civ VI Eurekas:**

* Shows: "Do X to boost tech Y"
* Doesn't force, but guides
* Reduces overwhelm without removing choice

**Lesson:** Present complexity clearly, help players navigate it

#### Technique 5: Selective Abstraction

**Pattern:** Keep detail where it matters, abstract elsewhere

**D\&D encumbrance example:**

* Strict weight tracking: Tedious, not fun
* Abstract slots: Simple, serves purpose
* Ignore entirely: Often best (not worth tracking)

**Decision:** "Does this tracking create interesting decisions?"

* If YES → Keep it
* If NO → Abstract or remove

***

## Part 6: Examples Across Games

### Blades in the Dark: Intentional Low Cognitive Load

**Design goal:** Narrative/Fellowship aesthetic (crime drama)

**Cognitive load management:**

1. **Fiction-first (not calculation-first):**
   * Say what you do, don't optimize stats
   * GM translates to mechanics
   * Brainspace: Focus on story, not math

2. **Flashbacks (eliminate planning):**
   * Don't spend hour planning heist
   * Declare preparation retroactively
   * Brainspace: Play forward, not predict

3. **Simple core mechanic:**
   * Roll dice pool, count successes
   * Easy to eyeball odds
   * Brainspace: Don't calculate expected value

4. **GM holds complexity:**
   * World state, NPC motivations, faction clocks
   * Players just: "What do we do?"
   * Brainspace: Offloaded to GM

5. **Limited choices per moment:**
   * "Resist? How much stress?"
   * Not "choose from 40 abilities"
   * Brainspace: Clear decision points

**Result:** Low cognitive load enables narrative focus

### Catan: Social Over Optimization

**Design goal:** Fellowship aesthetic (social negotiation)

**Cognitive load choices:**

1. **Simple resources:** 5 types, clear costs
   * Can hold in head while talking
   * Brainspace: Focus on negotiation

2. **Visible board state:**
   * Everyone sees who needs what
   * Creates conversation
   * Brainspace: Social reads, not calculation

3. **Probabilistic production:**
   * Can't perfectly optimize
   * Creates discussion topics
   * Brainspace: Don't need perfect math

4. **Trading as core:**
   * Must interact with players
   * Social intelligence matters
   * Brainspace: People skills, not math

**Result:** Simplicity enables social experience

### Slay the Spire: Scalable Complexity

**Design goal:** Challenge/Mastery aesthetics

**Cognitive load design:**

1. **Turn-based:** Infinite thinking time
2. **But complex:** Deck tracking, probability, synergies
3. **Scalable:**
   * Casual: Play cards that look good (works on low difficulty)
   * Expert: Calculate exact deck probabilities (wins more on high difficulty)

**The genius:** Same game serves different engagement levels

* No time pressure (turn-based)
* Rewards calculation (deep strategy)
* Doesn't require it (can play casually)

**Pattern:** Turn-based + depth = scalable cognitive load

### WoW Evolution: Accessibility Through Simplification

**Classic WoW (2004):**

* 40+ abilities per class
* Complex buff management
* Threat meters (manual tracking)
* Result: High cognitive load

**Modern WoW (2020+):**

* 15-20 core abilities
* Simplified buff system
* Clear rotations
* Result: Lower cognitive load

**Why the change:**

* Realized players couldn't track everything in real-time
* Streamlined so brainspace goes to encounter mechanics
* Design evolution: Respect player capacity

**Lesson:** Real-time games need simpler systems than turn-based

### StarCraft: Embrace the Impossible

**Design choice:** Make optimal play literally impossible

**How:**

* More actions than can be executed (APM limit)
* More information than can be processed (fog of war, multiple bases)
* Simultaneous management (economy + military + scouting)

**Result:**

* Skill = prioritization under pressure
* Physical execution matters (APM)
* Strategic thinking under time constraint
* Different than turn-based strategy

**This is intentional:** The impossibility creates the skill ceiling

**Contrast with:**

* Warhammer: Complexity from rules bloat (unintentional)
* Difference: Elegant impossibility vs. messy complexity

***

## Part 7: What We Still Need to Cover

### Topics Identified But Not Fully Explored

#### 7.1: UI and Presentation

**Key insight from System Evolution L39-41:**

* "Interface is the game"
* Same complexity, different cognitive load based on presentation
* Visual clarity matters as much as mechanical simplicity

**Questions to explore:**

* How does UI design affect cognitive load?
* What makes information "readable" vs. overwhelming?
* Civ VI example: Adjacency bonuses visible, math hidden
* XCOM: Hit percentages, damage preview (clear feedback)

**Needs:** Dedicated section on presentation and information design

#### 7.2: Learning Curves and Onboarding

**Question:** How does cognitive load change as players master systems?

**Observations:**

* Beginners: Higher load (learning rules)
* Intermediate: Moderate load (understanding patterns)
* Experts: Lower load (automatic patterns) OR higher load (deeper optimization)

**Slay the Spire example:**

* New players: Learn card effects (high load)
* Experienced: Recognize synergies (moderate load)
* Experts: Calculate exact probabilities (high load by choice)

**Questions to explore:**

* How to design for different skill levels simultaneously?
* Progressive complexity revelation?
* Tutorial design?

**Needs:** Section on learning curves and skill development

#### 7.3: Attention Management in Real-Time

**The "more things to do than can be done" pattern needs deeper analysis**

**Questions:**

* How do real-time games direct attention?
* What makes attention management skillful vs. frustrating?
* Audio/visual cues (StarCraft alerts, XCOM indicators)
* Information hierarchy (what's important NOW?)

**Needs:** Section on real-time attention management

#### 7.4: Cognitive Load and Accessibility

**Touched on but not explored:**

* Different players have different cognitive capacities
* Accessibility isn't just physical (colorblind, motor skills)
* Cognitive accessibility matters (processing speed, working memory, attention)

**Questions:**

* How to design for cognitive diversity?
* Difficulty options vs. complexity options?
* Assist modes (automation without trivializing)?

**Needs:** Section on cognitive accessibility

#### 7.5: Memory and State Tracking

**Different types of memory demands:**

**Working memory (active tracking):**

* "I have 3 cards left in draw pile"
* "Enemy has 15 HP"
* Limited capacity (7±2 items)

**Long-term memory (learned patterns):**

* "This card combo is good"
* "That formation is weak to flanking"
* Built through experience

**Questions:**

* What should require working memory vs. long-term?
* How to design for limited working memory?
* Perfect information games (chess) vs. hidden information (poker)

**Needs:** Section on memory types and design

#### 7.6: Social Context and Cognitive Load

**Touched on but needs expansion:**

* Group play distributes cognitive load (or concentrates it on one player)
* "Quarterbacking" in co-ops (one player decides for all)
* Parallel vs. sequential decision-making
* Social negotiation as cognitive load (Catan trading)

**Questions:**

* How does group size affect cognitive load?
* Preventing quarterbacking?
* Encouraging distributed thinking?

**Needs:** Section on social dynamics and cognitive load

#### 7.7: Randomness and Cognitive Load

**Brief mention, needs exploration:**

* Randomness prevents perfect optimization (reduces calculation load)
* But creates uncertainty anxiety
* Probabilistic vs. deterministic systems

**Questions:**

* How does randomness affect cognitive load?
* "Can calculate odds" vs. "must react to results"
* Poker calculation vs. Catan dice adaptation

**Needs:** Section on randomness and calculability

#### 7.8: Emergent Complexity

**Pattern not yet explored:**

* Simple rules → complex interactions (Go, Magic: The Gathering)
* Designed complexity vs. emergent complexity
* Rule interactions creating cognitive overhead

**Questions:**

* How to design for emergent complexity?
* When is emergence good vs. overwhelming?
* Testing for unexpected interactions?

**Needs:** Section on emergence and interaction complexity

#### 7.9: Pacing and Cognitive Rhythm

**Observation:** Games have cognitive pacing (intense → rest → intense)

**Examples:**

* D\&D: Combat (high load) → exploration (low load) → social (medium load)
* Slay the Spire: Intense fights → shopping (low load) → events (medium)
* StarCraft: Macro phases (high APM) → lulls → battles (extreme APM)

**Questions:**

* How to design cognitive pacing?
* Recovery periods between high-load sections?
* Sustained vs. burst cognitive demands?

**Needs:** Section on cognitive pacing and rhythm

#### 7.10: LLM Implications (Brief)

**What LLMs change:**

* Can track complex state automatically
* Natural language reduces "translation" load
* Perfect consistency (no memory errors)

**What LLMs DON'T change:**

* Players still need to understand systems
* Complexity still has cost
* Can offload tracking, can't offload comprehension

**Questions:**

* What cognitive loads can LLMs eliminate?
* What loads remain player-facing?
* New cognitive loads created (understanding AI behavior)?

**Needs:** Brief section on LLM affordances (detailed treatment elsewhere)

## Part 9: Key Principles Identified So Far

### Principle 1: Cognitive Load Must Match Aesthetic Goal

**Pattern:** Different aesthetics require different cognitive profiles

* Challenge aesthetic → High load acceptable (thinking IS the point)
* Fellowship aesthetic → Low load (brainspace for socializing)
* Narrative aesthetic → Low load (don't break immersion)
* Mastery aesthetic → High load (optimization is the goal)

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated across multiple examples

### Principle 2: Time Pressure Fundamentally Changes the Game

**Pattern:** Real-time vs. turn-based creates entirely different cognitive experiences

* Turn-based: Can handle more complexity
* Real-time: Must simplify for time pressure
* Same mechanics, different time model = different game

**Example:** They Are Billions with/without pause

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated

### Principle 3: Complexity Budget Is Finite

**Pattern:** Players can only track so much

* Simple games (Catan): 5 resources, everyone can manage
* Complex games (Warhammer): Hundreds of rules, experts only
* Accumulation: Each system adds to cognitive load

**Guideline:** 3-5 major systems is manageable, 6-10 is challenging, 10+ overwhelming

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated (from System Evolution lessons, WoW currency problem)

### Principle 4: Offloading Enables Complexity

**Pattern:** Moving complexity to GM or computer frees player brainspace

* Blades: GM tracks world, players track character
* Video games: Computer calculates, players decide
* Tabletop: Simple player-facing, complex GM-facing

**Trade-off:** Offloading can reduce transparency

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated

### Principle 5: Spatial > Numerical Complexity

**Pattern:** Players handle visual/spatial complexity better than abstract math

* Civ VI: District placement puzzle (good)
* Civ IV: Specialist spreadsheets (bad)
* XCOM: Cover positioning (good)
* Old XCOM: Time unit calculation (bad)

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated (System Evolution L4)

### Principle 6: "Skill Through Impossibility" Can Work

**Pattern:** Making optimal play impossible creates unique skill expression

**When it works:**

* StarCraft: Elegant impossibility (APM limit creates prioritization skill)
* Go: Calculation impossible, intuition develops
* Intentional design

**When it doesn't:**

* Warhammer: Messy impossibility (too many rules, "gotcha" moments)
* Unintentional complexity creep

**Difference:** Elegant constraints vs. accidental bloat

**Confidence:** ⚠️ Pattern identified but needs more validation

### Principle 7: Scalable Complexity Serves Multiple Skill Levels

**Pattern:** Turn-based + depth allows players to engage at different cognitive levels

* Slay the Spire: Casual play works, expert calculation rewarded
* Same game serves both audiences
* Requires: No time pressure + meaningful depth

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated (Slay the Spire example)

### Principle 8: Simplification ≠ Dumbing Down

**Pattern:** Can be more accessible AND deeper through smart simplification

* D\&D 5e advantage/disadvantage: Simpler than +2/-2 modifiers, same strategic depth
* XCOM 2-action system: Simpler than Time Units, more tactical depth

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated (System Evolution L2)

### Principle 9: UI Is Part of Cognitive Load

**Pattern:** Same complexity, different presentation = different cognitive load

* Clear UI reduces load without reducing depth
* Opaque UI increases load without adding depth
* "Interface is the game" (System Evolution L39)

**Confidence:** ✅ Validated (needs deeper exploration)

### Principle 10: Cognitive Load Changes With Mastery

**Pattern:** Same system, different load at different skill levels

* Novices: High load (learning)
* Experts: Can be lower (automatic) OR higher (deeper optimization by choice)
* Must design for progression

**Confidence:** ⚠️ Observed but needs more analysis

***

## Part 13: Connection to Other Framework Documents

### How This Connects to Resource Management

**Resources chapter covered:**

* In-game mechanical entities
* Scarcity, recovery, spending patterns
* When to make something a resource
* Psychological effects (possession, greed, FOMO)

**Cognitive Load chapter covers:**

* Player mental capacity (constraint)
* How complexity affects feasible resource designs
* When tracking resources is worth the cognitive cost

**The relationship:**

* Resources CREATE cognitive load (through tracking)
* Cognitive load LIMITS resource designs (can't be too complex)
* Must balance: Resource depth vs. cognitive capacity

**Design question bridging both:**
"Is this resource worth the cognitive overhead it creates?"

### How This Connects to What Is a Game System

**System Functions include cognitive considerations:**

**Function 7: Aesthetic Reinforcement**

* Cognitive load must match aesthetic
* Challenge aesthetics can handle high load
* Fellowship/Narrative need low load

**Configuration Coherence:**

* Mechanics + Parameters + Context + Pacing
* All must be within player cognitive budget
* Can't have perfect coherence if too complex to parse

### How This Connects to Balance (Future Chapter)

**Balance asks:** "How much of each resource?"
**Cognitive Load asks:** "How many resources can players track?"

**The relationship:**

* Can't balance what players can't comprehend
* Must ensure balanced system is parseable
* Perfect balance is worthless if too complex to understand

### How This Connects to Scenario Testing

**When testing scenarios:**

* Can players track the systems?
* Is cognitive load appropriate for aesthetic?
* Does complexity serve experience?

**Scenario 1 (Busy Adults) specifically:**

* Monthly sessions = high load on remembering previous session
* Need systems that offload state tracking
* Perfect use case for LLM state management

**Scenario 3 (Mystery) taught us:**

* Don't gate progress behind complex checks
* Simple mechanics for investigation
* Cognitive load goes to interpretation, not tracking

***

## Part 14: Summary and Key Takeaways

### Core Insights

**1. Cognitive load is a design tool, not just a problem**

* Different load levels create different experiences
* Match cognitive profile to aesthetic goal
* "How much thinking" is a design choice

**2. Cognitive load is a constraint, not a resource**

* External to game state
* Can't be "spent" or "recovered" in game terms
* Shapes what systems are feasible
* Use different design tools than resources

**3. Time pressure fundamentally changes the cognitive game**

* Real-time limits complexity budget
* Turn-based allows deeper systems
* Same mechanics, different time = different experience

**4. Complexity has a sweet spot**

* Too simple: Solvable, boring for experts
* Too complex: Overwhelming, incomprehensible
* Just right: Deep but approachable
* Sweet spot varies by aesthetic and audience

**5. Offloading enables complexity without overwhelming players**

* GM-facing: Human referee absorbs complexity
* Computer-facing: Automation handles tracking
* Player-facing: Only what creates decisions
* Strategic distribution of complexity

**6. "Skill through impossibility" can work when elegant**

* StarCraft: More actions than can be executed
* Go: Complexity beyond calculation
* Creates unique skill expression through prioritization
* But: Must be intentional, not accidental bloat

### What Makes This Different from Resources

**Resources:**

* Mechanical game entities
* Players manage them strategically
* Scarcity creates decisions
* Part of game state

**Cognitive Load:**

* Player mental capacity
* Designer accommodates it
* Complexity creates different experiences
* External constraint on design

**Both matter, but require different design approaches**

### Aesthetic Implications

**Challenge/Mastery:**

* High cognitive load acceptable (the point!)
* Complexity creates depth
* Turn-based allows deep systems

**Fellowship:**

* Low cognitive load essential
* Brainspace for socializing
* Simple mechanics enable interaction

**Narrative:**

**Tension:**

* Time pressure + moderate load
* Real-time creates urgency
* Must be parseable under pressure

**Expression/Discovery:**

* Variable load acceptable
* Depends on type of expression/discovery
* Can be high if players choose engagement level

### Design Principles Extracted

1. **Match cognitive load to aesthetic goal**
2. **Time pressure reduces complexity budget**
3. **Offload complexity strategically**
4. **Simplification ≠ dumbing down**
5. **Spatial > numerical complexity**
6. **UI affects cognitive load as much as mechanics**
7. **Design for learning curve (novice → expert)**
8. **"Skill through impossibility" requires elegance**
9. **Scalable complexity serves multiple audiences**
10. **Cognitive load is a constraint to respect**
