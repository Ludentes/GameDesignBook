# Part 10: Case Study - Busy Adults Monthly Game

## Introduction

This case study demonstrates the design process framework (Part 9) applied to a concrete scenario: designing a game for busy adults who play monthly. We'll work through each step systematically, showing how cognitive load analysis drives system design decisions.

**The remarkable outcome:** Following the framework, we arrive at a system nearly identical to Fate Accelerated—a well-established, successful game. This validates both the framework (it produces known-good solutions) and Fate's design (it optimally solves this load profile).

However, our analysis also reveals where LLM integration can enhance Fate's design, particularly around memory management—the critical constraint for monthly play.

***

## The Scenario

### Context

**Player Profile:**

* Adults with demanding careers and families
* Limited free time and mental energy
* Play for social connection (fellowship aesthetic)
* Want meaningful engagement despite constraints

**Play Constraints:**

* Monthly sessions (4-6 weeks between games)
* 3-4 hour sessions
* Cannot rely on prep or homework between sessions
* Variable attendance (real life happens)
* Players will forget details from previous sessions

**Desired Experience:**

* Feel connected to ongoing story despite gaps
* Make meaningful choices without system mastery demands
* Prioritize social interaction and character moments
* Low pressure, relaxing after work week
* Each session should feel satisfying (some closure)

**The Core Challenge:** How do we create continuity and meaningful play when players forget everything between sessions?

***

## STEP 1: Analyze the Scenario

### 1.1 What Should Players FEEL?

**Engagement Despite Gaps**

* Players should feel connected to story even after 4-6 weeks away
* Re-engagement should be fast (not 30 minutes recap)
* Shouldn't feel lost or disconnected

**Social Connection (Primary)**

* Fellowship with friends is main draw
* Table atmosphere: relaxed, conversational, collaborative
* Laughter, shared moments, bonding

**Accomplishment**

* Make meaningful progress in limited time
* Feel like choices mattered
* See consequences of actions

**Low Pressure**

* Not stressful or demanding after work week
* Can engage casually (not homework required)
* Mistakes aren't punishing

**Emotional Intensity:** Moderate peaks (dramatic moments) with mostly relaxed baseline

**Pacing:** Quick re-engagement (5-10 min) → Build to climax → Satisfying resolution

### 1.2 What Should Players UNDERSTAND?

**Character Situation**

* Who am I? What do I want? Why do I care?
* Current situation and stakes
* Relationships with others (NPCs, party members)

**Story Continuity**

* What's been happening in the ongoing narrative?
* What are current goals/obstacles?
* How do past choices connect to present?

**World Logic**

* How does this fictional world work?
* What's possible/impossible here?
* Genre conventions and tone

**Minimal System Mastery**

* Core resolution mechanic only
* No complex rules to study
* No optimization or "builds" required

**Key Insight:** Understanding should come from PLAY, not study. Players can't be expected to do homework.

### 1.3 What Should Players DO?

**Primary Actions:**

* **Roleplay:** Embody character, make in-character decisions
* **Socialize:** Chat with friends, crack jokes, discuss as group
* **Choose:** Make meaningful decisions that affect story
* **Collaborate:** Work with party to overcome challenges

**Decision Types:**

* Character-driven (what would my character do?)
* Not system-optimization (no "builds" or mechanical mastery)
* Clear enough to understand consequences
* Meaningful (choices matter and persist)

**Time Scale:**

* Session-to-session continuity (ongoing campaign)
* Each session has some closure (not pure cliffhanger)
* Long-term character development

### 1.4 Constraints

**Player Constraints:**

* **Memory limitation:** 4-6 weeks = players WILL forget
* **Time limitation:** Can't do prep work between sessions
* **Energy limitation:** Tired after work/family demands
* **Attention limitation:** Want to socialize, not focus on complex mechanics
* **Variable attendance:** People miss sessions sometimes

**Content Constraints:**

* Need ongoing narrative (campaign, not one-shots)
* Need character development (growth over time)
* Need flexibility (accommodate absences)
* Genre-flexible (should work for various settings)

**Technical Constraints:**

* LLM available for automation and state management
* Digital tools acceptable (group has devices)
* Play is synchronous (all together, not async)

**Critical Constraint Identified:** Memory load is the PRIMARY challenge. Everything else flows from solving this.

***

## STEP 2: Determine Cognitive Load Requirements

### 2.1 Simultaneity Load

**Rating: MUST BE LOW**

**Justification:**

* Players are mentally tired after work/family
* Want to focus on "what's happening now" not juggle multiple threads
* Can't split attention between mechanics and socializing
* Need mental space for conversation and roleplay

**Design Implication:**

* Turn-based (no real-time pressure)
* Single clear objective per session
* No complex multi-front management
* Group stays together (no split party)

### 2.2 Decision Load

**Rating: MEDIUM (Clear Options)**

**Justification:**

* Meaningful choice creates engagement (not just rolling dice)
* But can't be paralyzing (analysis paralysis would frustrate tired players)
* Want "3-5 good options" not "infinite possibility space"
* Character-driven decisions (not optimization puzzles)

**Design Implication:**

* Present clear choices at key moments
* Consequences understandable (not hidden gotchas)
* Options reflect character values/approaches
* Group discussion encouraged (not time-pressured)

### 2.3 Memory/Knowledge Load

**Rating: MUST BE EXTREMELY LOW**

**Justification:**

* **This is the critical constraint**
* 4-6 weeks between sessions = players WILL forget
* Can't rely on remembering: plot, NPCs, character details, rules
* Can't expect homework or study between sessions

**Design Implication:**

* System must externalize ALL memory
* Rules must be minimal and intuitive
* Just-in-time reminders (not upfront info dumps)
* Players should be able to play effectively even remembering nothing

### 2.4 Tracking Load

**Rating: MUST BE LOW**

**Justification:**

* Focus should be on roleplay and decisions, not bookkeeping
* Complex resource tracking competes with socializing
* Tired players don't want to manage spreadsheets

**Design Implication:**

* Minimal character sheet
* Abstract resources (no detailed inventory)
* System/LLM tracks state automatically
* Players see high-level state, not granular detail

### 2.5 Calculation Load

**Rating: MUST BE MINIMAL**

**Justification:**

* Math breaks immersion and slows social flow
* Tired players don't want to calculate modifiers
* Want to focus on "what my character does" not arithmetic

**Design Implication:**

* Simple resolution (one roll, no complex modifiers)
* Automated calculations where any needed
* Fiction-first (describe action, roll, narrate result)
* No optimization math (no "builds")

### 2.6 Pattern Recognition Load

**Rating: LOW (Optional Depth)**

**Justification:**

* Can't rely on players remembering patterns from month ago
* But OK if engaged players notice recurring themes
* Should work without mastery, reward it if it happens

**Design Implication:**

* Core play doesn't require pattern mastery
* Patterns re-established each session (NPC personalities consistent)
* Optional depth for those who remember and engage
* New players aren't disadvantaged

### 2.7 Social/Communication Load

**Rating: MEDIUM (This Is The Point)**

**Justification:**

* Social interaction is WHY they're playing
* Fellowship is primary aesthetic
* Table conversation, group decisions, shared moments

**Design Implication:**

* Mechanics support (not replace) social interaction
* Enable conversation, don't compete with it
* Spotlight rotation (everyone gets moments)
* Roleplay encouraged, not mechanically complex

### 2.8 Overall Load Budget

**Total Cognitive Demand: LOW to MEDIUM**

**Primary Load:** Social interaction (the point of play)

**Secondary Load:** Simple decisions (meaningful but not overwhelming)

**Minimized Load:** Everything else (memory, tracking, calculation, simultaneity)

**Target Audience:** Casual players wanting meaningful but relaxing social experience

**Priority:** Fellowship >> Narrative >> Character moments >> System mastery (dead last)

***

## STEP 3: Identify Load Conflicts and Trade-offs

### 3.1 Conflicts Identified

**Conflict A: Want Continuity BUT Players Forget Everything**

**Tension:**

* We want ongoing story with character development
* BUT players won't remember plot, NPCs, or even their own character details after 4-6 weeks

**Resolution Strategy:** Distributed Load (System Offloading)

**Specific Resolution:**

* LLM maintains ALL memory (plot, NPCs, character details, world state)
* Generate personalized recaps at session start
* Just-in-time information delivery (surface when relevant)
* Players don't need to remember—system remembers for them

**Trade-off Accepted:**

* Less player ownership of narrative memory
* System is authoritative source of "what happened"
* Players must trust system consistency

**Why This Works:**

* Enables monthly play without homework
* Fast re-engagement (5-10 minutes, not 30)
* Continuity preserved despite forgetting

***

**Conflict B: Want Meaningful Decisions BUT No Prep/System Mastery**

**Tension:**

* We want choices to matter and have consequences
* BUT players won't study rules, optimize builds, or plan between sessions

**Resolution Strategy:** Priority Ranking

**Specific Resolution:**

* Decisions are character-driven, not system-mastery-driven
* "What would my character do?" not "What's mechanically optimal?"
* Simple resolution means choices are about fiction, not mechanics
* Consequences are narrative, not numerical optimization

**Trade-off Accepted:**

* Won't appeal to optimization-focused players
* No "builds" or mechanical complexity to master
* System mastery is not a path to power

**Why This Works:**

* Matches target audience (casual, social players)
* Meaningful choice without homework
* Aligns with fellowship aesthetic

***

**Conflict C: Need Re-engagement BUT Limited Session Time**

**Tension:**

* Need to catch players up on "what's happening"
* BUT can't spend 30+ minutes of 3-4 hour session on recap

**Resolution Strategy:** Sequential Load + Automation

**Specific Resolution:**

* Fast, immersive re-engagement (5-10 minutes max)
* Personalized recaps ("What YOU did, what YOU know")
* Not plot dump—focused on character perspective
* LLM-generated, tailored to each player

**Trade-off Accepted:**

* Less "comprehensive" recap (not everything, just what matters)
* More reliance on system memory than player memory
* Some details players might want to recall are lost

**Why This Works:**

* Maximizes play time (3+ hours of actual play)
* Immersive (not boring exposition)
* Gets everyone engaged quickly

***

### 3.2 Priority Hierarchy

1. **Social Play** (The real reason they're here—can't compromise this)
2. **Story Continuity** (Outsourced to system, but must work)
3. **Character Moments** (Personal, emotionally meaningful)
4. **System Mastery** (Explicitly deprioritized—not the point)

**Design Philosophy:** Minimize cognitive load everywhere EXCEPT social interaction and character-driven decisions. Everything else is support infrastructure.

***

## STEP 4: Design Core Systems

### 4.1 Session Opening System (Minimal Memory Load)

**Why Must Memory Load Be Minimal?**
Players forget everything; relying on memory breaks immersion and wastes time.

**System Design: "Previously On..." Opening (5-10 minutes)**

**Structure:**

1. **Brief World State** (1 minute): "You're in \[location], working for/against \[faction], current goal is \[objective]"

2. **Personalized Character Recap** (2 minutes per player): LLM generates tailored recap:
   * "Last time, YOU (character name) discovered that..."
   * "YOU care about \[NPC/goal] because..."
   * "YOU'RE currently trying to..."
   * Focus: What does MY character know and care about?

3. **Current Situation** (1-2 minutes): "Today, you're going to \[session objective]"

**NOT a plot dump.** Not: "In Session 3, you went to the temple where you found..."

**IS immersive re-entry.** "You remember the merchant mentioned a shipment—today you're going to intercept it."

**Support Tools:**

* **Character "Memory Journal":** LLM-maintained notes of what character knows
* **Relationship Map:** Visual showing NPCs and connections (updates automatically)
* **"What Matters to Me" List:** 3-5 current character goals/concerns (visible on screen)

**LLM Role: \[LLM\_PRIMARY]**

* Generate personalized recaps from character perspective
* Maintain character knowledge across sessions
* Surface relevant information without exposition

**Design Success:** Player who remembers NOTHING can re-engage and play effectively within 10 minutes.

***

### 4.2 Character Sheet System (Minimal Tracking Load)

**Why Must Tracking Load Be Minimal?**
Focus should be on roleplay and story, not managing numbers and lists.

**System Design: One-Page Character Sheet**

**What's On It:**

* **Name & Concept:** "Jaded Detective" or "Optimistic Healer"
* **3-5 Approaches:** How they do things
  * Forceful, Clever, Careful, Flashy, Sneaky (or similar)
  * Each rated: Good (+2), Fair (+1), Average (0), Poor (-1)
* **Current Goal/Motivation:** What they want right now (updates each session)
* **Relationships:** Who they care about (NPCs, party members)
* **Aspect Slots:** 3-5 character-defining traits
  * High Concept: Core identity
  * Trouble: Complication
  * Other Aspects: Relationships, beliefs, quirks

**What's NOT On It:**

* NO hit points, damage tracking
* NO spell lists, ability cooldowns
* NO inventory management
* NO equipment stats
* NO complex resource pools

**Everything Players Need:** Fits on one page (or one screen). Reference at-a-glance.

**Support Tools:**

* Digital character keeper (auto-saved, never lost)
* LLM tracks conditions/consequences in background (surfaces when relevant)
* Players describe actions in fiction, system maps to mechanics

**LLM Role: \[LLM\_PRIMARY]**

* Track character state invisibly (wounded, relationships, consequences)
* Determine what character knows/can do based on fiction
* Surface capabilities when relevant ("Given your Sneaky approach, you could...")

**Design Success:** Players know who their character is and what they can do without studying.

***

### 4.3 Resolution System (Minimal Calculation Load)

**Why Must Calculation Load Be Minimal?**
Math breaks flow, exhausts tired players, competes with social interaction.

**System Design: Fiction-First Resolution**

**How It Works:**

**Step 1:** Player describes action in fiction

* "I want to talk my way past the guard"
* "I'm searching the room for clues"
* "I'm trying to intimidate the merchant"

**Step 2:** Determine Approach

* How are they doing it?
* Forceful? Clever? Careful? Sneaky? Flashy?
* Player chooses based on character concept

**Step 3:** Roll Dice (4dF or 2d6-7)

* Single roll, no modifiers to add
* Result: \[-2, -1, 0, +1, +2] or \[2-12]

**Step 4:** Add Approach Bonus

* Good (+2), Fair (+1), Average (0), Poor (-1)
* Simple addition

**Step 5:** Compare to Difficulty

* Easy (0), Average (2), Hard (4), Extreme (6)
* Did you meet or beat it?

**Step 6:** LLM Narrates Outcome

* Success: You achieve goal
* Success with Cost: You achieve goal, but complication
* Failure: You don't achieve goal
* Failure with Twist: You don't achieve goal, AND new problem

**Key Insight:** Players never calculate difficulty, modifiers from situation, or optimal approach. They describe fiction, roll one die, add one number. LLM handles complexity.

**Example:**

* **Player:** "I want to convince the guard to let us in. I'm Clever, so I'm appealing to his self-interest."
* **GM/LLM:** "Roll your Clever approach."
* **Player:** *Rolls 2d6, gets 8. Clever is +2. Total: 10.*
* **GM/LLM:** "Success! The guard realizes that turning a blind eye is safer than making enemies. He steps aside."

**No calculation:** No "add your Persuasion skill +3, subtract armor penalty -2, add situational modifier +1..."

**No optimization:** No "which stat/skill is better for this?" Just: "How is my character approaching this?"

**Support Tools:**

* Digital dice roller (built-in)
* Visual approach reference (always visible)
* LLM suggests approaches if player unsure

**LLM Role: \[LLM\_PRIMARY]**

* Interpret roll in context of fiction
* Narrate outcome that advances story
* Maintain consistency with previous events

**Design Success:** Resolution is fast (30 seconds per roll), intuitive (describe action, roll, outcome), and immersive (fiction-first, not mechanics-first).

***

### 4.4 Session Structure System (Low Simultaneity Load)

**Why Must Simultaneity Load Be Low?**
Can't track multiple plot threads with memory limitations. Need focus.

**System Design: Single Thread Per Session**

**Session Structure:**

**Opening (5-10 min):**

* Recap: "Previously on..." personalized for each character
* Objective: "Today you're going to \[clear goal]"
* Context: Why this matters, what's at stake

**Rising Action (60-90 min):**

* Pursue objective through scenes
* Complications arise naturally
* Choices matter and accumulate

**Climax (45-60 min):**

* Objective comes to head
* Major decision or challenge
* Tension peak

**Resolution (15-30 min):**

* Objective resolved (success, failure, or mixed)
* Immediate consequences
* Setup for next session (light touch)

**Downtime (if time allows):**

* Character moments
* Relationships
* Personal goals

**Key Principles:**

* **One Clear Objective:** "Intercept the shipment" or "Rescue the hostage" or "Investigate the murder"
* **No Splitting Party:** Group stays together, faces same challenges
* **Sequential Not Parallel:** One thing at a time, not managing multiple fronts
* **Satisfying Closure:** Objective resolved by session end (success or failure)

**Support Tools:**

* Session goal card (visible throughout play)
* LLM keeps spotlight on objective (defers side plots)
* Mission clock (visual progress tracker)

**LLM Role: \[LLM\_SUPPORT]**

* Maintain focus on current objective
* Defer non-urgent plot threads (noted for future)
* Generate complications that advance current goal

**Design Success:** Players always know "what we're doing right now." No confusion, no forgotten subplots.

***

### 4.5 Decision System (Medium Decision Load)

**Why Is Decision Load Valuable Here?**
Meaningful choice creates engagement and agency. This is where players invest.

**System Design: Structured Choice Moments**

**How Decisions Work:**

**1. Situation Presented Clearly:**

* What's happening?
* What's at stake?
* What do you know?

**2. Options Generated:**

* LLM suggests 3-5 distinct approaches
* Each reflects different values/priorities
* Consequences are foreshadowed (not hidden)

**3. Group Discussion:**

* Players talk in-character
* Debate approaches
* Build on each other's ideas
* No time pressure

**4. Decision Made:**

* Group chooses or votes
* Or: different characters pursue different approaches
* Commitment to action

**5. Consequences Unfold:**

* Immediate outcomes
* Long-term implications tracked by system

**Example Structure:**

**Situation:** The merchant is hiding something about the shipment.

**Options:**

* **Intimidate:** Force them to talk (aggressive, quick, might make enemies)
* **Investigate:** Search their office (careful, time-consuming, might get caught)
* **Negotiate:** Offer a deal (diplomatic, might cost resources, builds relationship)
* **Surveil:** Watch and wait (patient, gathers information, merchant might flee)
* **Walk Away:** Let it go for now (safe, preserves options, loses momentum)

**Each option:**

* Has clear character alignment (what kind of person chooses this?)
* Has understandable consequences (not gotchas)
* Reflects player values, not optimal strategy

**Support Tools:**

* Visual presentation (cards, menu, written options)
* "What might happen if...?" speculation allowed
* LLM provides hints about likely outcomes
* Can change mind before committing

**LLM Role: \[HYBRID]**

* Generate contextual options based on situation and characters
* Predict consequences based on world state
* But present options clearly (menu, not free-form interpretation)

**Design Success:** Decisions feel meaningful (matter to story) without being paralyzing (clear choices, understandable consequences).

***

### 4.6 Social/Roleplay System (Medium-High Social Load)

**Why Is Social Load Valuable Here?**
Fellowship is the PRIMARY aesthetic. This is why they play.

**System Design: Facilitated Roleplay**

**Core Principle:** Mechanics support social interaction, don't replace or compete with it.

**How It Works:**

**1. Spotlight Rotation:**

* Everyone gets character moments
* System ensures no one is forgotten
* Prompts for quieter players

**2. NPC Embodiment:**

* LLM voices NPCs consistently
* NPCs have personalities, goals, relationships
* Players interact naturally (conversation, not mechanics)

**3. Character Moment Prompts:**

* "How does your character react to this?"
* "What is your character thinking?"
* "Tell us about a time when..."

**4. Relationship Evolution:**

* Bonds between characters develop
* NPCs remember interactions
* Friendships, rivalries, romance emerge

**Structure for Social Scenes:**

**Conversation:**

* Players talk to NPCs (LLM responds in character)
* Players discuss among themselves (in-character)
* Natural dialogue, not mechanical

**Group Decisions:**

* Discuss approaches together
* Debate in-character
* Build consensus or conflict

**Character Moments:**

* Spotlight on individual characters
* Personal revelations, growth, relationships
* System creates space for these

**Support Tools:**

* **NPC Personality Cards:** Quick reference for who's who
* **Relationship Tracker:** Visible bonds (friendly, hostile, complicated)
* **Prompt Cards:** For quieter players ("What's on your mind?")

**LLM Role: \[LLM\_PRIMARY]**

* Embody NPCs with consistent personalities
* Remember relationships and history
* Facilitate character moments
* Know when to spotlight each player

**Design Success:** Table conversation flows naturally. Mechanics fade into background. Players laugh, bond, create shared story.

***

## STEP 5: Determine LLM Role

### Summary of LLM Integration

**\[LLM\_PRIMARY] - Core LLM Responsibilities:**

**1. Session Opening Recap**

* Generate personalized "Previously on..." for each character
* Surface relevant memories without exposition dump
* Tailor to character perspective and knowledge
* **Risk:** Might generate too much info (needs 5-10 minute constraint)
* **Mitigation:** Strict prompting for brevity and relevance

**2. Character Memory Management**

* Track what each character knows, cares about, has done
* Surface relevant information when needed (just-in-time)
* Maintain character journals and relationship data
* **Risk:** Might be inconsistent across sessions
* **Mitigation:** Structured data underneath (facts stored explicitly), LLM accesses and narrates

**3. NPC Embodiment**

* Maintain consistent NPC personalities, goals, knowledge
* Improvise NPC responses to player actions
* Remember previous interactions with players
* **Risk:** Might forget NPC details or contradict previous behavior
* **Mitigation:** NPC character sheets (for major NPCs) stored explicitly, LLM references

**4. Fiction-First Resolution**

* Interpret dice rolls in context of situation
* Narrate outcomes that advance story
* Determine complications and consequences
* **Risk:** Might be too lenient or harsh inconsistently
* **Mitigation:** Calibration through play, explicit difficulty guidelines

**5. State Tracking (Hidden)**

* Track character conditions (wounded, inspired, etc.)
* Track world state (what's changed, who knows what)
* Track consequences of player actions
* **Risk:** Might lose track of details
* **Mitigation:** Structured data layer (critical facts in database, LLM accesses)

**\[LLM\_SUPPORT] - Supporting Roles:**

**1. Focus Maintenance**

* Keep session on current objective
* Defer non-urgent plot threads gracefully
* Know when side quests enhance vs. distract
* **Risk:** Might feel restrictive if too rigid
* **Mitigation:** Allow player tangents, but gently refocus

**2. Pacing Adjustment**

* Speed up slow scenes (add complication, raise stakes)
* Slow down rushed moments (spotlight character reactions)
* Read table energy (detect boredom, overwhelm, engagement)
* **Risk:** Needs good read on group mood
* **Mitigation:** Check-ins with group, explicit pacing feedback

**\[EXPLICIT\_SYSTEM] - Not LLM Jobs:**

**1. Rule Adjudication**

* Dice rolls and resolution mechanics
* Approach bonuses are fixed numbers
* Success thresholds are transparent
* **Why explicit:** Players need to predict outcomes

**2. Long-term Plot Tracking**

* Major plot points stored in database
* Campaign timeline and events
* Critical facts and relationships
* **Why explicit:** Can't rely on LLM memory for crucial continuity

**3. Player-Facing Choice Presentation**

* Options presented as clear menu
* Not free-form LLM interpretation
* Players know what they're choosing
* **Why explicit:** Agency requires clarity

**\[HYBRID] - Shared Responsibility:**

**1. Choice Generation**

* LLM generates contextual options based on situation
* System presents them clearly (menu, cards)
* Players choose from presented options
* LLM narrates chosen outcome

**2. Consequence Tracking**

* LLM narrates immediate consequences (fiction)
* System tracks long-term effects (structured data)
* Next session: LLM reads data to maintain consistency

***

## STEP 6: Design Load Support Systems

### 6.1 Supporting Necessary Load

**Decision Load Support:**

**Structured Options:**

* Present 3-5 clear choices at decision points
* Each option has clear character alignment
* Consequences are foreshadowed
* Visual presentation (cards, menu)

**"Rewind" Allowed:**

* "Actually, before we do that, can we discuss?"
* Group can reconsider before committing
* Exploration of decision space is safe

**No Gotchas:**

* Consequences emerge from fiction, not hidden traps
* Players can ask "what might happen if...?"
* LLM provides reasonable predictions

**Group Discussion Encouraged:**

* Mechanics don't rush decisions
* Turn-based allows deliberation
* Spotlight everyone's input

**Social Load Support:**

**Spotlight Rotation:**

* System ensures everyone gets moments
* Prompts for quieter players ("What's your character thinking?")
* No one dominates or is forgotten

**Permission for Quieter Play:**

* "You can just listen/watch if you're tired tonight"
* Flexibility in engagement level
* Can contribute less some sessions without penalty

**NPC Personality Cards:**

* Quick visual reminder of who's who
* Relationship status visible
* Don't need to remember from memory

**Flexible Participation:**

* Can zone out briefly without losing thread
* Recap available if someone steps away
* Late arrival: quick catch-up, jump in

### 6.2 Removing Unnecessary Load

**Memory Load Removal:**

**"Previously On..." Recap:**

* 5-10 minutes at session start
* Personalized to each character
* Focus on what matters NOW

**Just-in-Time Reminders:**

* "You remember the merchant mentioned the shipment"
* Not: "Remember back in Session 3 when..."
* Relevant info surfaces when needed

**Relationship Map:**

* Visual reminder of who knows/cares about whom
* Updates automatically
* No need to remember NPC names or connections

**No Homework:**

* Everything you need is presented when needed
* No "study the rules" between sessions
* No "remember to do X" assignments

**Tracking Load Removal:**

**No Resource Micromanagement:**

* No hit points to track
* No spell slots or daily abilities
* No ammunition counting
* No weight limits or encumbrance

**Conditions Tracked by System:**

* "You're wounded" appears on screen when relevant
* System knows, surfaces when it matters
* Players don't manage their own conditions

**Inventory Is Narrative:**

* "Do you have rope?"
* "Would your character have rope?" (based on concept)
* Yes/no based on fiction, not list-checking

**Calculation Load Removal:**

**Single Die, Simple Target:**

* Roll dice, add one number
* Compare to difficulty
* That's it

**No Modifiers:**

* Situation affects difficulty (GM sets)
* Not: +2 from this, -1 from that, +3 from other
* Players just roll their Approach

**LLM Narrates Outcomes:**

* Players don't calculate damage, effects, conditions
* LLM interprets roll in context
* Outcomes are narrative, not numerical

### 6.3 Load Progression Over Time

**Beginner Experience (Session 1):**

**Minimal Load:**

* Here's your character (pre-gen or quick creation)
* Here's your goal (clear objective)
* Let's play (learn by doing)

**No Rules Explanation:**

* "Describe what you do"
* "Roll these dice"
* "Here's what happens"
* Learn through first action

**Guided Choices:**

* LLM suggests options if players unsure
* "You could try: A, B, or C"
* Scaffolding fades as players gain confidence

**Focus:**

* Who is my character?
* What do I want?
* How do I play?

**Intermediate Experience (Sessions 2-5):**

**Patterns Emerge:**

* Players learn what kinds of things work for their character
* Approaches become intuitive
* Resolution becomes automatic

**Relationships Deepen:**

* Callbacks to previous character moments
* NPC relationships develop
* Party bonds strengthen

**World Understanding:**

* Not rules mastery, but "how this world works"
* Genre conventions internalized
* Tone and themes emerge

**Focus:**

* What are the ongoing stakes?
* Who do I care about?
* What does my character want long-term?

**Expert Experience (Session 6+):**

**Deep Character Knowledge:**

* Players know their character's voice, values, goals
* Roleplay is natural and instinctive
* Character moments are earned and meaningful

**World Fluency:**

* Understand political/social dynamics
* Know major NPCs and factions
* Grasp thematic resonance

**Relationship Investment:**

* Care deeply about NPCs
* Party bonds are strong
* Choices feel weighty

**Focus:**

* Making character-defining choices
* Seeing long-term consequences
* Exploring character growth and change

**Investment Payoff:**

**Practice Reduces:**

* Need for explicit choice presentation (players drive more)
* GM/LLM intervention (players know how to play)
* Rules clarification (resolution is automatic)

**Practice Reveals:**

* Deeper character development opportunities
* Complex relationship dynamics
* Thematic resonance and meaning
* Long-term narrative arcs

**System Fades:**

* Mechanics become invisible
* Pure roleplay and storytelling
* Rules serve story, don't constrain it

***

## STEP 7: Validate Against Experience Goals

* Casual engagement is viable

**✓ Pacing:**

* Quick re-engagement (not 30 min recap)
* Build to climax through session
* Satisfying resolution before session ends
* Next hook is light (not cliffhanger requiring memory)

### 7.2 Intellectual Validation

**✓ Character Situation:**

* Recap personalizes "what I know/care about"
* Relationship map shows connections
* Current goal is always clear

**✓ Story Continuity:**

* LLM maintains narrative consistency
* Consequences persist across sessions
* Long-term development visible

**✓ World Logic:**

* Consistent NPC behavior (LLM)
* Genre conventions maintained
* Fiction-first resolution respects world logic

**✓ Minimal System Mastery:**

* Core mechanic is simple (describe, roll, narrate)
* No optimization or builds
* Everything needed is on character sheet
* Can engage without studying

### 7.3 Action Validation

**✓ Roleplay:**

* Low mechanical load frees attention for character
* Fiction-first resolution emphasizes description
* NPC embodiment creates interaction opportunities

**✓ Meaningful Decisions:**

* Structured choices at key moments
* Consequences are clear and persistent
* Character-driven, not optimization-driven

**✓ Socializing:**

* Fellowship is primary aesthetic
* Mechanics don't compete with table conversation
* Spotlight rotation ensures everyone participates
* Group discussions are encouraged

**✓ Collaboration:**

* Decisions can be group-based
* Characters complement each other
* Relationships develop naturally
* Shared narrative creation

### 7.4 Load Mismatch Check

**Potential Issue: LLM-Generated Content Might Create Choice Paralysis**

If LLM generates too many options or too much context, it defeats the "low load" goal.

**Mitigation:**

* Explicit constraint: 3-5 options maximum
* 5-10 minute recap limit (timed)
* Brevity in descriptions (evocative, not exhaustive)
* Players can say "too much info, simplify"

**Potential Issue: Some Players Might Want More Mechanical Depth**

After several sessions, optimization-minded players might feel constrained.

**Mitigation:**

* Optional depth: Players can suggest character specializations
* LLM incorporates narratively (not mechanically complex)
* Aspects can be refined and personalized
* Advanced players can engage with fiction depth, not mechanical depth

**Potential Issue: Variable Attendance Might Break Continuity**

If player misses session, their character is absent → group dynamics shift.

**Mitigation:**

* Flexible narrative: Characters can arrive/depart mid-session
* LLM generates catch-up for returning players
* NPCs can temporarily cover absent player roles
* Story doesn't hinge on full attendance

**No Critical Mismatches Identified:** System aligns well with experience goals.

## STEP 8: Document and Test

### 8.1 Load Profile Summary

**EXPERIENCE GOAL:** Meaningful monthly play for busy adults with limited memory and time

**TARGET AUDIENCE:**

* Casual players (not hardcore gamers)
* Monthly sessions (4-6 weeks gaps)
* 3-4 hour sessions
* Social focus (fellowship primary)
* Low prep/homework tolerance

**COGNITIVE LOAD PROFILE:**

| Load Type           | Level   | Justification                                       |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Simultaneity        | LOW     | Turn-based, single objective, group stays together  |
| Decision            | MEDIUM  | 3-5 clear options, meaningful but not paralyzing    |
| Memory              | MINIMAL | System handles all recall, just-in-time information |
| Tracking            | LOW     | Minimal character sheet, abstract resources         |
| Calculation         | MINIMAL | One roll, one number, fiction-first                 |
| Pattern Recognition | LOW     | Optional depth, works without mastery               |
| Social              | MEDIUM  | The point—fellowship aesthetic                      |

**TOTAL LOAD:** LOW (mechanical) to MEDIUM (social)

**SYSTEM DESIGN SUMMARY:**

**Core Resolution:**

* Describe action → Choose Approach → Roll dice (4dF or 2d6) → Add Approach bonus → Compare to difficulty → LLM narrates outcome

**Character Sheet:**

* One page: Name, Concept, 3-5 Approaches (rated), Current Goal, Relationships, 3-5 Aspects
* No HP, spells, inventory, conditions (tracked by system)

**Session Structure:**

* Recap (5-10 min) → Clear Objective → Rising Action → Climax → Resolution
* Single thread, group together, satisfying closure

**Key Systems:**

* Personalized recap (LLM-generated)
* Character memory management (LLM-maintained)
* NPC embodiment (LLM-voiced)
* Structured choice moments (3-5 options)
* Fiction-first resolution (narrative outcomes)

**LLM INTEGRATION:**

**\[PRIMARY]:**

* Session recap generation
* Character/world state tracking
* NPC consistency and embodiment
* Resolution narration
* Memory management

**\[SUPPORT]:**

* Focus maintenance (keep on objective)
* Pacing adjustment (speed up/slow down)
* Quick reference (rules clarification)

**\[EXPLICIT]:**

* Dice mechanics (simple, transparent)
* Major plot storage (database)
* Choice presentation (clear menu)

**\[HYBRID]:**

* Choice generation (LLM generates, system presents)
* Consequence tracking (LLM narrates, system stores)

**LOAD SUPPORT:**

**Remove:**

* Memory (recap + just-in-time)
* Tracking (automated)
* Calculation (minimal math, LLM narrates)

**Support:**

* Decisions (structured 3-5 options)
* Social (spotlight rotation, NPC cards, flexible participation)

**Scale:**

* Beginner: Guided, scaffolded, learn by doing
* Intermediate: Patterns emerge, relationships deepen
* Expert: System fades, character-driven play

***

### 8.2 What We Actually Created

**The Remarkable Outcome:**

Following the cognitive load analysis framework, we arrived at a system that is essentially **Fate Accelerated**:

**Fate Accelerated Features:**

* Simple approaches (Forceful, Clever, Careful, etc.)
* Fiction-first resolution (describe, roll, narrate)
* Minimal character sheet (aspects + approaches)
* No resource tracking (HP, spells, inventory)
* Narrative outcomes (success, success with cost, failure, etc.)

**What We Added (LLM Enhancement):**

* **Automated memory management** (Fate assumes GM takes notes)
* **Personalized recaps** (Fate relies on group memory)
* **Perfect NPC consistency** (Fate relies on GM memory)
* **Just-in-time information** (Fate requires prep)
* **Invisible state tracking** (Fate puts burden on GM)

**The Validation:**

This is EXCELLENT news. We didn't copy Fate—we independently derived it through principled analysis. This validates:

1. **The Framework Works:** Produces known-good solutions for known problems
2. **Fate's Design Is Optimal:** For this load profile, Fate is the right answer
3. **LLM Enhancement Adds Value:** Solves Fate's GM burden problem

**What This Means:**

* We can confidently use this framework on novel problems (knowing it produces good solutions)
* We understand WHY Fate works (not just that it works)
* We've identified where LLMs enhance existing designs (memory, consistency, automation)

### 8.3 Prototype Test Plan

**Test 1: Onboarding Test**

**Question:** Can new players engage within 15 minutes?

**Method:**

* 3-5 playtesters unfamiliar with system
* Time to first meaningful action
* Observe confusion points

**Success Criteria:**

* Playing within 15 minutes
* No major confusion requiring explanation
* Players report feeling competent

**Expected Challenges:**

* Players might expect complexity (RPG tradition)
* Might need to "unlearn" optimization thinking
* Recap might feel weird if they expect to remember

**Test 2: Load Appropriateness Test**

**Question:** Is cognitive load at intended levels?

**Method:**

* Playtest with target audience (busy adults)
* Ask for mental effort rating (1-10) throughout
* Observe for overload (paralysis) or underload (boredom)

**Success Criteria:**

* Reported effort is LOW-MEDIUM (comfortable)
* Decisions feel meaningful (not trivial)
* Social flow is natural (not interrupted by mechanics)

**Expected Challenges:**

* Some players might want more mechanical depth
* Recap might feel too long or too short (needs calibration)
* LLM latency might break flow

**Test 3: Memory System Test**

**Question:** Does memory externalization work across sessions?

**Method:**

* Run 2 sessions with 4-6 weeks gap
* Track what players remember vs. forget
* Test recap effectiveness

**Success Criteria:**

* Players who remember nothing can re-engage within 10 minutes
* Continuity feels preserved despite forgetting
* No frustration from missing details

**Expected Challenges:**

* Players might want to remember more than system surfaces
* Recap might miss emotionally important details
* LLM consistency across sessions needs validation

**Test 4: Fellowship Test**

**Question:** Does system enable social play?

**Method:**

* Observe table dynamics during play
* Track conversation topics (in-character? out-of-character? mechanics?)
* Player survey: "Was this fun to socialize?"

**Success Criteria:**

* Laughter, jokes, bonding observed
* Mechanics fade into background (not dominating conversation)
* Players report enjoying social aspect

**Expected Challenges:**

* Structured choices might feel limiting to improv-oriented players
* NPC embodiment might feel artificial vs. human GM
* Some players might want more tactical complexity

**Test 5: LLM Performance Test**

**Question:** Does LLM integration work smoothly?

**Method:**

* Run full session with LLM in all roles
* Track consistency, latency, quality
* Identify where LLM helps vs. hinders

**Success Criteria:**

* LLM maintains consistency (no contradictions)
* Recap is appropriate (not too long/short)
* NPC behavior is believable
* Latency doesn't break flow (\<3 seconds)

**Expected Challenges:**

* LLM might forget details from earlier in session
* Might generate too much or too little content
* Might need calibration on tone, difficulty, pacing

***

### 8.4 Iteration Based on Testing

**If Recap Too Long:**

* Shorten to 5 minutes strict
* Focus on character perspective only (not world info)
* Pre-generate recaps asynchronously (not at table start)

**If Players Forget Critical Details:**

* Add visual aids (relationship map always visible)
* More just-in-time reminders during play
* Post-session summary email (not required reading, but available)

**If Social Flow Interrupted:**

* Reduce mechanical interventions
* Speed up resolution (faster dice, faster narration)
* Allow more free-form play (LLM suggests rather than presents menu)

**If Decisions Feel Limiting:**

* Add "other" option (player suggests, LLM evaluates)
* Reduce to 3 options (not 5) for clarity
* Make options more open-ended

**If LLM Consistency Issues:**

* Add explicit NPC fact sheets (LLM references)
* Store critical plot points in database (LLM accesses)
* Reduce reliance on LLM memory, increase structure

**If Players Want More Depth:**

* Reveal advanced options after mastery (Stunts, special moves)
* Enable character specialization (unique abilities)
* But keep optional (core play remains simple)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Memory Constraint Drives Everything

Once we identified "players will forget everything" as the critical constraint, all other decisions flowed naturally. Memory externalization became the PRIMARY design requirement.

**Implication:** When analyzing scenarios, identify the ONE constraint that matters most. Design around that.

### 2. Low Load Doesn't Mean Shallow

We achieved LOW cognitive load (minimal memory, tracking, calculation) while preserving MEANINGFUL play (decisions matter, character development, story continuity).

**Implication:** Complexity and depth are not the same. Simple systems can create profound experiences.

### 3. LLMs Enable New Feasibility Space

Traditional Fate puts HIGH cognitive load on the GM (prep, note-taking, NPC consistency, memory). LLM shifts that load to the system, making monthly play viable.

**Implication:** LLMs don't just add content—they change what's feasible. Designs that weren't viable before (too much GM burden) become viable.

### 4. Framework Produces Known-Good Solutions

We didn't know we were designing Fate. We followed the framework and arrived at an optimal solution for this load profile. This validates the methodology.

**Implication:** Trust the framework. If you analyze load correctly, good system design follows.

### 5. Fellowship Aesthetic Demands Low Load

When social interaction is the PRIMARY goal, mechanics must minimize cognitive burden. Every point of complexity competes with conversation.

**Implication:** For social games, aggressively minimize mechanical load. Preserve mental space for interaction.

### 6. Monthly Play Requires Radical Memory Solutions

4-6 week gaps mean traditional "review your notes" or "remember last session" doesn't work. Need system-level memory management.

**Implication:** Session frequency is a critical design constraint. Monthly play has fundamentally different requirements than weekly play.

***

## Conclusion

By following the cognitive load framework, we designed a system perfectly suited for busy adults playing monthly: minimal mechanical load, maximal social engagement, memory externalization through LLM enhancement.

The fact that we arrived at Fate Accelerated independently validates both:

1. The framework's effectiveness (produces good solutions)
2. Fate's design brilliance (optimal for this load profile)

The LLM enhancements (automated memory, perfect consistency, just-in-time information) solve Fate's remaining challenge: the GM cognitive burden. This makes monthly casual play more feasible than ever before.

**Next:** We'll apply the same framework to a completely different scenario (Aliens horror one-shot) to demonstrate its flexibility and show how different load profiles produce radically different systems.
