# Part 7: Player Types and Load Preferences

## Introduction

Not all players want the same cognitive experience. Some thrive on overwhelming complexity, others prefer streamlined simplicity. Some want to master intricate systems, others want to explore freely without mental burden.

**Richard Bartle's taxonomy** (Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, Killers) provides a framework for understanding player motivations. When applied to cognitive load, it reveals that **different player types have different load preferences and tolerances**.

This chapter explores:

* How Bartle types map to cognitive load profiles
* Why certain players gravitate toward high or low load games
* How to design for your target audience
* How to accommodate multiple player types in one game

***

## Bartle's Taxonomy: Quick Overview

**Richard Bartle (1996)** identified four player types based on two axes:

**Axis 1: Acting vs. Interacting**

* Acting: Players who DO things (to world or to players)
* Interacting: Players who engage WITH things (world or players)

**Axis 2: World vs. Players**

* World: Focus on game environment, systems, content
* Players: Focus on other people, social dynamics

**The four types:**

1. **ACHIEVERS** (Acting on World)
   * Goal: Mastery, completion, achievement
   * Motivated by: Challenges to overcome, skills to perfect, goals to reach

2. **EXPLORERS** (Interacting with World)
   * Goal: Discovery, understanding, uncovering secrets
   * Motivated by: Hidden content, system depth, lore

3. **SOCIALIZERS** (Interacting with Players)
   * Goal: Relationships, community, shared experiences
   * Motivated by: Conversation, cooperation, belonging

4. **KILLERS** (Acting on Players)
   * Goal: Competition, dominance, impact on others
   * Motivated by: Winning, outplaying opponents, reputation

**Key insight:** These aren't absolute categories—players can be hybrids, or shift based on mood/context. But the framework helps understand different relationships to cognitive load.

***

## Achievers and Conquerable High Load

### Profile: Mastery Through Cognitive Challenge

**Achievers** are motivated by overcoming challenges and demonstrating skill. They WANT high cognitive load—as long as it's **conquerable**.

**Load preferences:**

**HIGH load is attractive when:**

* Mastery is clearly possible (not random, not arbitrary)
* Skill progression is visible (can see improvement)
* Complexity creates depth (more to optimize)
* Challenge is respected (prestige from overcoming difficulty)

**LOW load is boring:**

* Too simple = solved too quickly
* No skill ceiling = nothing to master
* Trivial = not impressive to overcome

**Load must be FAIR:**

* Transparent (understand why you failed)
* Consistent (can learn and improve)
* Conquerable (hard but achievable)

### Games That Attract Achievers

**StarCraft / Competitive RTS**

* **Load profile:** VERY HIGH (simultaneity, decision, real-time pressure)
* **Why Achievers love it:** Clear skill ceiling, visible mastery, APM/strategy optimization
* **What they optimize:** Faster/better execution, strategic refinement, matchup knowledge

**Dark Souls / Difficult Action Games**

* **Load profile:** HIGH initially (pattern recognition), decreases with mastery
* **Why Achievers love it:** "Git gud" progression, mastery feels earned, difficulty is prestige signal
* **What they optimize:** Perfect boss kills, no-hit runs, speedruns

**Chess / Abstract Strategy**

* **Load profile:** HIGH decision load, infinite depth
* **Why Achievers love it:** Clear rating system, endless improvement, respected skill hierarchy
* **What they optimize:** Opening theory, middlegame tactics, endgame technique

**Complex Deck-Builders / Optimization Games**

* **Load profile:** HIGH decision and calculation load
* **Why Achievers love it:** Many variables to optimize, clear win/loss, meta-game mastery
* **What they optimize:** Deck synergies, probability calculations, meta adaptations

### What Achievers DON'T Want

**Random/Arbitrary Difficulty**

* High load that doesn't reflect skill (memorizing trivia, lucky rolls)
* Can't optimize = frustrating, not satisfying
* Example: Trivia games (knowledge-based, not skill-based)

**No Clear Victory**

* Open-ended games with no win condition
* Can't demonstrate mastery if there's no goal
* Example: Pure sandbox games (Minecraft without challenges)

**Skill Ceilings Too Low**

* Master game too quickly, then bored
* Need continuous improvement opportunity
* Example: Simple party games (fun once, then solved)

### Designing for Achievers

**Provide:**

* **High skill ceiling:** Always more to optimize (StarCraft's "always more to do")
* **Clear feedback:** Show improvement (ratings, times, scores)
* **Masterable systems:** Complex but learnable (not random)
* **Prestige markers:** Achievements, rankings, cosmetics for difficult feats
* **Scaling challenge:** Difficulty modes, ranked play, self-imposed challenges

**Avoid:**

* **Artificial grind:** Time-gating that doesn't reflect skill
* **Pay-to-win:** Purchasing power instead of earning mastery
* **Randomness as difficulty:** RNG that negates skill
* **Skill reset:** Changes that invalidate learned mastery (unless clearly communicated)

***

## Explorers and Tolerance for Messy Complexity

### Profile: Discovery Through Deep Engagement

**Explorers** are motivated by understanding systems, uncovering secrets, and discovering content. They TOLERATE high cognitive load—as long as there's **something to discover**.

**Load preferences:**

**HIGH load is acceptable when:**

* Complexity hides secrets (more to discover)
* Systems are deep (understanding takes time)
* Emergent behavior (surprising interactions)
* Lore to uncover (world-building depth)

**LOW load is fine IF:**

* Allows focus on exploration (not distracted by complex mechanics)
* Supports discovery aesthetic (simple interactions reveal complex world)

**Load can be MESSY:**

* Explorers tolerate inconsistency, bugs, rough edges
* Willing to dig through wikis, experiment, theorize
* Part of the discovery process

### Games That Attract Explorers

**Dwarf Fortress**

* **Load profile:** EXTREMELY HIGH (tracking, memory, interface)
* **Why Explorers love it:** Endless emergent behavior, deep simulation, surprising interactions
* **What they explore:** System depth, fortress stories, bizarre emergent phenomena

**Outer Wilds**

* **Load profile:** LOW-MEDIUM mechanics, HIGH synthesis (connecting clues across space/time)
* **Why Explorers love it:** Mystery to solve, non-linear discovery, "aha!" moments
* **What they explore:** Connections between clues, environmental storytelling, hidden secrets

**Minecraft (Exploration Mode)**

* **Load profile:** LOW mechanics, HIGH spatial/creative
* **Why Explorers love it:** Procedural world, secrets to find, building possibilities
* **What they explore:** Biomes, structures, Redstone mechanics, building techniques

**Environmental Storytelling Games (Dishonored, Bioshock, etc.)**

* **Load profile:** MEDIUM mechanics, HIGH attention to detail
* **Why Explorers love it:** Lore in readables, environmental clues, world consistency
* **What they explore:** Story fragments, world history, character backstories

### What Explorers DON'T Want

**Gated Content**

* Locked behind mandatory grinding or skill checks
* Can't explore freely if blocked by difficulty
* Example: Story locked behind hard boss fights (would prefer boss skip option)

**Empty Complexity**

* High load but no depth (just tedious, not interesting)
* Busywork that doesn't reveal anything
* Example: Inventory management with no meaningful choices

**Linear/On-Rails**

* No room for discovery if path is fixed
* Want to wander, experiment, sequence-break
* Example: Corridor shooters with no secrets

**Timed/Pressured**

* Can't explore under time pressure
* Want to take their time, notice details
* Example: Speedrun-required games (stressful, not contemplative)

### Designing for Explorers

**Provide:**

* **System depth:** Interactions to discover (not just surface complexity)
* **Hidden content:** Secrets, Easter eggs, optional areas
* **Environmental storytelling:** Details to notice, lore to piece together
* **Emergent behavior:** Systems that surprise even designers
* **Non-linear paths:** Multiple ways to engage, sequence-breaking allowed

**Avoid:**

* **Required optimization:** Don't force efficient play (let them wander)
* **Time pressure:** Allow contemplation, not rush
* **Gating exploration:** Make discovery accessible, not locked behind skill checks
* **Empty world:** Depth matters more than size (small rich > large empty)

**Accept:**

* **Messy complexity:** Explorers will learn it if there's depth
* **Rough edges:** Bugs/inconsistencies are tolerable if systems are interesting
* **Wiki dependency:** External resources are fine (part of exploration culture)

***

## Socializers and Preference for Distributed/Low Load

### Profile: Fellowship Through Accessible Systems

**Socializers** are motivated by relationships, community, and shared experiences. They PREFER low cognitive load—because they want **brainspace for socializing**.

**Load preferences:**

**LOW mechanical load is essential:**

* Simple rules = can talk while playing
* Quick turns = keeps conversation flowing
* Minimal calculation = don't break social rhythm
* Accessible = can play with anyone (not just experts)

**HIGH social load is welcome:**

* Negotiation, diplomacy, table talk
* Reading people, building trust/alliances
* Storytelling, shared jokes, creating memories

**Distributed load is ideal:**

* Cooperative games (work together)
* Team-based games (share cognitive burden)
* Asymmetric roles (different contributions, all valued)

### Games That Attract Socializers

**Party Games (Werewolf, Mafia, Codenames)**

* **Load profile:** LOW mechanics, HIGH social (deduction, persuasion)
* **Why Socializers love it:** Conversation is the game, accessible to all, memorable moments
* **What they enjoy:** Table dynamics, reading people, shared laughter

**Cooperative Board Games (Pandemic, Forbidden Island)**

* **Load profile:** LOW-MEDIUM mechanics, HIGH coordination
* **Why Socializers love it:** Work together, no player elimination, shared victory/defeat
* **What they enjoy:** Group problem-solving, helping each other, collective experience

**Casual MMOs / Social Simulators (Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley)**

* **Load profile:** LOW mechanical challenge, HIGH social interaction
* **Why Socializers love it:** Hang out with friends, casual play, community building
* **What they enjoy:** Decorating together, trading, showing off creations, chatting

**Storytelling RPGs (Powered by the Apocalypse games)**

* **Load profile:** LOW mechanics, HIGH narrative/social
* **Why Socializers love it:** Collaborative storytelling, character relationships, improv
* **What they enjoy:** Shared narrative, character moments, table chemistry

### What Socializers DON'T Want

**High Mechanical Load**

* Complex rules = can't socialize while playing
* Takes brainspace away from conversation
* Example: Heavy strategy games that demand silent concentration

**Player Elimination**

* Eliminated players can't participate (sit out, feel excluded)
* Breaks fellowship vibe
* Example: Traditional Risk, old-school board games

**Toxicity Enablers**

* Mechanics that encourage mean behavior
* Kingmaking, take-that cards, forced betrayal
* Example: Munchkin (designed to be antagonistic)

**Skill Gatekeeping**

* Experts dominate, novices feel excluded
* Can't play with friends of different skill levels
* Example: Fighting games with high execution barrier

### Designing for Socializers

**Provide:**

* **Simple mechanics:** Easy to learn, quick to play
* **Low downtime:** Frequent turn rotation, or simultaneous play
* **Cooperative options:** Work together, not just compete
* **Inclusive design:** No player elimination, all skill levels welcome
* **Social prompts:** Mechanics that encourage conversation (negotiation, storytelling)

**Avoid:**

* **Complexity for complexity's sake:** Keep it simple
* **Silent concentration:** Don't demand total focus
* **Mean mechanics:** Avoid designs that create bad feelings
* **Skill gaps:** Minimize advantage from mechanical mastery

**Support:**

* **Table talk:** Allow/encourage conversation during play
* **Catch-up mechanics:** Keep everyone in the game
* **Shared experiences:** Memorable moments > mechanical depth
* **Community features:** Clubs, guilds, friend lists, chat

***

## Killers and Load as Competitive Weapon

### Profile: Domination Through Superior Load Management

**Killers** are motivated by competition, impact on others, and demonstrating superiority. They EMBRACE high cognitive load—as long as it's a **competitive advantage**.

**Load preferences:**

**HIGH load is attractive when:**

* Mastering load = beating opponents
* Cognitive edge is advantage (better decision-making, faster processing)
* Outplaying others through superior management
* Load is weapon (overwhelming opponents who can't keep up)

**LOW load is acceptable when:**

* Social manipulation is the game (deception, politics)
* Mind-games matter more than mechanics
* Example: Poker (simple mechanics, high psychological complexity)

**Asymmetric load is interesting:**

* Different roles with different challenges
* Opportunity to exploit others' weaknesses
* Example: Among Us Impostor (harder role but powerful)

### Games That Attract Killers

**Competitive RTS / MOBAs (StarCraft, League of Legends)**

* **Load profile:** VERY HIGH simultaneity, decision, real-time pressure
* **Why Killers love it:** Better load management = winning, outplay opponents
* **What they optimize:** Macro/micro, matchup knowledge, psychological warfare

**Fighting Games (Street Fighter, Smash Bros)**

* **Load profile:** HIGH execution, pattern recognition, reaction time
* **Why Killers love it:** Direct competition (1v1), skill expression, dominance
* **What they optimize:** Frame data, mind-games, reading opponents

**Chess / Competitive Abstract Games**

* **Load profile:** HIGH decision load, zero randomness
* **Why Killers love it:** Pure skill, direct confrontation, clear winner
* **What they optimize:** Tactics, strategy, out-calculating opponent

**Social Deduction (Werewolf, Among Us, Poker)**

* **Load profile:** LOW-MEDIUM mechanics, VERY HIGH social/psychological
* **Why Killers love it:** Manipulate others, lie convincingly, control narrative
* **What they optimize:** Deception, reading tells, table control

### What Killers DON'T Want

**Pure Cooperation**

* No competition = no domination
* Want opponents to beat
* Example: Fully cooperative games (no individual victory)

**Randomness Negating Skill**

* If luck dominates, skill doesn't matter
* Can't demonstrate superiority through RNG
* Example: Candy Land (pure luck, zero skill)

**No Impact on Others**

* Solo challenges don't satisfy (no opponent to defeat)
* Want to affect other players directly
* Example: Single-player puzzle games (no PvP)

**Participation Trophies**

* Want hierarchy, not equality
* Victory meaningless if everyone "wins"
* Example: Non-competitive kids' games

### Designing for Killers

**Provide:**

* **Direct competition:** PvP, rankings, leaderboards
* **Skill-based advantage:** Better play = better results
* **Psychological depth:** Mind-games, bluffing, reading opponents
* **Prestige markers:** Ranks, titles, cosmetics for top players
* **Impact on others:** Direct interaction, not just parallel play

**Avoid:**

* **Rubber-banding:** Catch-up mechanics that negate lead
* **Forced cooperation:** Killers want competition, not teamwork
* **Hidden MMR:** Show rankings publicly (status matters)
* **Participation rewards:** Don't dilute victory's meaning

**Balance:**

* **Toxicity management:** Killers can create hostile environments
* **Sportsmanship incentives:** Reward respect, not just domination
* **Separate queues:** Competitive vs. casual modes
* **Report/ban systems:** Prevent abuse beyond game mechanics

***

## Hybrid Players and Spectrum Thinking

### Players Are Not Pure Types

**Reality:** Most players are hybrids with primary and secondary motivations.

**Common hybrids:**

**Achiever-Explorer:**

* Loves mastery AND discovery
* Wants to find optimal strategies through exploration
* Example: Speedrunners (master game, discover skips)

**Socializer-Achiever:**

* Enjoys community AND accomplishment
* Wants to achieve things WITH friends
* Example: MMO raiders (difficult content, but social experience)

**Killer-Achiever:**

* Competitive drive AND mastery focus
* Wants to win AND improve
* Example: Ranked competitive players (not just winning, climbing ladder)

**Explorer-Socializer:**

* Discovery AND sharing findings
* Wants to uncover secrets AND discuss with community
* Example: Lore theorists (explore deeply, share theories)

### Spectrum, Not Binary

Players aren't ONLY one type—they have proportions:

**Example player:**

* 40% Achiever (likes challenge)
* 30% Socializer (plays with friends)
* 20% Explorer (enjoys discovering builds)
* 10% Killer (occasionally likes PvP)

**Design implication:** Games can appeal to multiple types if they support different playstyles.

***

## Designing for Multiple Player Types

### Strategy 1: Layered Depth

**Principle:** Surface simplicity with optional complexity.

**How it works:**

* **Socializers:** Engage with simple surface (mechanics don't interfere with conversation)
* **Achievers:** Dive into optimization (deeper tactics, build crafting)
* **Explorers:** Discover hidden depth (emergent strategies, secret interactions)
* **Killers:** Use depth to dominate (superior knowledge = advantage)

**Example: Slay the Spire**

* **Surface:** Simple card game (play cards, deal damage, block)
* **Achiever depth:** Optimal card synergies, deckbuilding theory, ascension difficulty
* **Explorer depth:** Discovering combos, secret events, relic interactions
* **Killer depth:** Daily challenges leaderboard, speedrun competition
* **Socializer:** (Less served—single-player, but community shares builds/seeds)

**Key:** Depth is OPTIONAL. Can enjoy game at surface level or dive deep.

***

### Strategy 2: Multiple Modes/Paths

**Principle:** Separate experiences for different player types.

**How it works:**

* **Ranked competitive:** For Killers and Achievers (high stakes, skill-based)
* **Casual/social:** For Socializers (low pressure, matchmaking by social graph)
* **Creative/sandbox:** For Explorers (freedom to experiment, no pressure)
* **Challenge modes:** For Achievers (specific difficult content)

**Example: Minecraft**

* **Survival mode:** Achievers (beat the dragon, build efficiently)
* **Creative mode:** Explorers and Socializers (build freely, show friends)
* **Hardcore mode:** Achievers (permadeath, ultimate challenge)
* **Multiplayer servers:** All types (PvP for Killers, communities for Socializers, minigames for Achievers)

**Key:** Players self-select into mode that matches their preferences.

***

### Strategy 3: Role Differentiation

**Principle:** Different roles serve different player types.

**How it works:**

* **DPS/Carry:** Killers and Achievers (high impact, mechanical skill)
* **Support/Healer:** Socializers (enable team, less mechanical stress)
* **Tank/Controller:** Achievers (macro play, strategic decisions)
* **Scout/Specialist:** Explorers (find information, map knowledge)

**Example: Overwatch / Team Games**

* **Damage heroes:** Killers and Achievers (fragging, mechanical skill)
* **Support heroes:** Socializers (heal team, enable others, less aim-intensive)
* **Tank heroes:** Achievers (positioning, game sense, strategic calls)
* **Flankers:** Killers (solo impact, assassinate key targets)

**Key:** All roles are valuable, different load profiles appeal to different players.

***

### Strategy 4: Scalable Challenge

**Principle:** Difficulty adjusts to player preference.

**How it works:**

* **Easy mode:** Socializers, Explorers (low mechanical load, can focus on story/discovery)
* **Normal mode:** General audience (balanced challenge)
* **Hard mode:** Achievers (conquerable difficulty, prestige)
* **Extreme/permadeath:** Hardcore Achievers (ultimate challenge)

**Example: Hades**

* **God Mode:** Can enable damage reduction (accessibility for story focus)
* **Heat system:** Add difficulty modifiers for challenge (Achievers push higher heat)
* **Speedrun mode:** Timer for competitive comparison (Killers)
* **Baseline:** Fun for all types (well-tuned default difficulty)

**Key:** Players choose their cognitive load level.

***

## Load Preferences by Type: Summary Table

| Player Type     | Preferred Load Level             | Load Types They Seek                            | Load Types They Avoid                                       | Example Games                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Achievers**   | HIGH (if conquerable)            | Decision, Pattern Recognition, Calculation      | Random/Arbitrary, Trivial, Unsolvable                       | StarCraft, Dark Souls, Chess, Optimization Puzzles                 |
| **Explorers**   | Variable (tolerates messy)       | Discovery, Synthesis, System Depth              | Gated Content, Timed Pressure, Empty Complexity             | Dwarf Fortress, Outer Wilds, Minecraft, Environmental Storytelling |
| **Socializers** | LOW (mechanical) / HIGH (social) | Social/Communication, Negotiation, Storytelling | Complex Mechanics, Silent Concentration, Player Elimination | Party Games, Cooperative Games, Social Sims, Storytelling RPGs     |
| **Killers**     | HIGH (if competitive advantage)  | Decision, Execution, Psychological              | Pure Cooperation, Luck-Based, No PvP Impact                 | Competitive RTS/Fighting Games, Poker, Social Deduction            |

## Design Questions: Matching Load to Audience

When designing for a target player type:

### For Achievers:

* [ ] Is there a clear skill ceiling to reach for?
* [ ] Can players see their improvement over time?
* [ ] Is mastery satisfying (not just tedious)?
* [ ] Are systems transparent (can learn from failure)?
* [ ] Is difficulty fair (not random or arbitrary)?

### For Explorers:

* [ ] Is there depth to discover (hidden secrets, emergent behavior)?
* [ ] Can players explore freely (not gated behind skill checks)?
* [ ] Is the world consistent (rewards attention to detail)?
* [ ] Are there multiple valid approaches (not one optimal path)?
* [ ] Can players take their time (not time-pressured)?

### For Socializers:

* [ ] Are mechanics simple enough to socialize while playing?
* [ ] Does the game encourage positive interaction?
* [ ] Can friends of different skill levels play together?
* [ ] Is there low downtime (everyone stays engaged)?
* [ ] Does the game create shared memorable moments?

### For Killers:

* [ ] Is there direct competition (PvP, rankings)?
* [ ] Does skill create clear advantage (not pure luck)?
* [ ] Can players impact others directly (not just parallel play)?
* [ ] Is victory meaningful (prestige, recognition)?
* [ ] Are psychological tactics viable (mind-games, bluffing)?

### For Hybrid Audiences:

* [ ] Can the game serve multiple player types?
* [ ] Is depth optional (surface simplicity + hidden complexity)?
* [ ] Are there multiple modes/paths for different preferences?
* [ ] Do different roles serve different player types?
* [ ] Can players adjust difficulty/challenge level?

## Case Studies: Player Type Design

### Case Study 1: Dark Souls (Achiever-Focused)

**Primary audience:** Achievers who want conquerable high challenge

**Load profile:**

* HIGH pattern recognition (learn through death)
* MEDIUM spatial/execution (positioning, timing)
* LOW rules complexity (simple controls)

**Why Achievers love it:**

* Clear mastery progression (boss seems impossible → farm until trivial)
* Skill-based (not luck or grinding, pure "git gud")
* Prestige (beating hard game is accomplishment)
* Community recognition (sharing victories)

**How it accommodates others:**

* **Explorers:** Environmental storytelling, hidden secrets, lore fragments
* **Socializers:** (Limited) Co-op summons, messages, community sharing
* **Killers:** PvP invasions (optional)

**What it sacrifices:**

* Doesn't serve casual Socializers (too difficult, too solo-focused)
* Doesn't compromise difficulty for accessibility (intentional gate)

***

### Case Study 2: Among Us (Multiple Types)

**Primary audiences:** Socializers, Killers, some Achievers

**Load profile:**

* LOW mechanical (simple tasks)
* HIGH social (deduction, deception, persuasion)
* Asymmetric (Impostor >> Crewmate load)

**Why different types engage:**

**Socializers:**

* Conversation is the game (discussion phase)
* Play with friends (social context matters)
* Accessible (anyone can play)

**Killers:**

* Can dominate as Impostor (manipulate, deceive, win)
* Impact others directly (kill, sabotage, control narrative)
* Competitive (be best Impostor)

**Achievers:**

* Master Impostor role (high-load challenge)
* Detective work as Crewmate (solve puzzle)
* Improve deduction/deception skills

**Explorers:**

* (Least served) Map knowledge, optimal task routes, vent locations

**Why it works for multiple types:**

* Different load profiles for different roles (Socializers can coast as Crewmate, Killers challenged as Impostor)
* Core experience is social (appeals to Socializers)
* But has skill depth (appeals to Achievers)
* Competitive element (appeals to Killers)

***

### Case Study 3: Minecraft (Broad Appeal)

**Primary audiences:** All types through different modes

**Load profiles by mode:**

**Survival Mode:**

* MEDIUM mechanics (crafting, combat, resource management)
* Achievers: Beat dragon, build efficiently, optimize farms
* Explorers: Discover biomes, find structures, experiment with Redstone

**Creative Mode:**

* LOW mechanics (infinite resources, no threats)
* Explorers: Build freely, experiment with mechanics
* Socializers: Show friends creations, collaborate on builds

**Multiplayer Servers:**

* Variable (depends on server type)
* Socializers: Community, events, hanging out
* Killers: PvP servers, factions, competition
* Achievers: Minigames, challenges, ranks

**Why it serves all types:**

* Multiple modes for different preferences
* Opt-in depth (can play casually or deep-dive)
* Social layer available but optional
* Creative expression for all types

**Key insight:** Sandbox games can serve broad audiences by allowing player-defined goals.

***

## Summary: Designing for Your Audience

**Key insights:**

1. **Different player types have different load preferences**—Achievers want conquerable high load, Socializers want low mechanical load, Explorers tolerate mess, Killers embrace competition.

2. **Hybrid players are common**—most people have primary + secondary types, not pure categories.

3. **Load can serve multiple types**—layered depth, multiple modes, role differentiation, scalable challenge.

4. **Know your primary audience**—can't serve everyone equally, but can accommodate multiple types.

5. **Match load to motivation**—Achievers = mastery, Explorers = discovery, Socializers = fellowship, Killers = domination.

**Design principles:**

* **Target primary type** (who is this game FOR?)
* **Accommodate secondary types** (how can others enjoy it?)
* **Provide appropriate load** (match cognitive profile to player motivation)
* **Allow opt-in/opt-out** (different modes, roles, difficulty levels)
* **Don't compromise core** (trying to serve everyone equally serves no one well)

**When targeting specific types:**

* **Achievers:** High but fair challenge, clear progression, skill expression
* **Explorers:** System depth, freedom to discover, non-linear paths
* **Socializers:** Simple mechanics, cooperative play, shared experiences
* **Killers:** Direct competition, psychological depth, skill advantage

In the next chapter, we'll explore how to SUPPORT cognitive load through tools, UI, automation, and onboarding—making necessary complexity manageable.
