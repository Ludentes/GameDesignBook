# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Document 6: Spending and Agency

***

## The Player's Perspective

Previous documents covered what resources are, when to use them, and how they replenish. This document focuses on the player's experience: **How do players interact with resources? What choices do they make? What creates satisfying agency?**

**Core insight:** Resource management is meaningless without player agency. The quality of spending decisions determines whether resources create engaging gameplay or tedious bookkeeping.

***

## High-Level Principle: Agency Creates Engagement

✅ **Validated across all analyzed games**

**Principle:** Players must have meaningful choices about resource acquisition and spending for resource management to be engaging. Remove agency (automatic spending, obvious choices, no alternatives) and resources become busywork.

**The spectrum:**

* **High agency:** Multiple viable options, unclear optimal choice, player expression
* **Moderate agency:** Several options, some better than others, optimization possible
* **Low agency:** Few options, obvious best choice, mechanical execution
* **No agency:** Automatic or forced spending, no player decision

**Implication:** Resources without agency should be reconsidered. Either add meaningful choices or remove the resource.

***

## Types of Resource Spending

### Spending Type 1: Active Choice (Direct Player Control)

**Definition:** Player explicitly decides when and how to spend resource.

**Examples:**

* Playing cards in Slay the Spire (choose which cards)
* Spending gold on purchases (choose what to buy)
* Using abilities in D\&D (choose when to cast spell)
* Blades stress resistance (choose whether to resist)

#### Characteristics

**Decision point:** Clear and conscious
**Player control:** Complete
**Satisfaction:** High (when choice matters)

#### What Creates Good Active Choices

**Multiple viable options:**

* Not one obviously best answer
* Different options for different situations
* Player preference matters

**Clear trade-offs:**

* Understand consequences
* Can predict outcomes (roughly)
* Risk/reward calculable

**Timing matters:**

* When to spend is meaningful
* Early vs. late spending creates different outcomes
* Saving for later is viable strategy

**Example - Slay the Spire Card Play:**

* Have 5 cards, 3 energy
* Can play cards in different orders
* Each order creates different outcome
* **Good because:** Multiple viable sequences, timing matters, clear trade-offs

**Example - Blades Stress Resistance:**

* GM presents consequence
* Choose: Accept harm OR spend stress to resist
* Must weigh: Stress now vs. injury later
* **Good because:** Meaningful choice, player expression, consequences clear

#### When Active Choice Works Best

✓ **Good for:**

* Challenge/Mastery aesthetic (optimization)
* Strategic depth
* Player expression
* Tactical gameplay

✗ **Poor for:**

* Fast-paced action (too much decision-making slows flow)
* Submission aesthetic (choices create stress)
* When optimal choice is obvious (becomes mechanical)

### Spending Type 2: Passive Drain (Involuntary Loss)

**Definition:** Resource depletes automatically or through external forces, player doesn't choose to spend.

**Examples:**

* HP lost when hit (damage happens TO you)
* Time passing (real-time strategy, survival games)
* Upkeep costs (automatic deductions)
* Entropy/decay systems

#### Characteristics

**Decision point:** Indirect (prevent loss, not control spending)
**Player control:** Defensive (minimize loss, not choose use)
**Satisfaction:** From prevention, not spending

#### What Makes Passive Drain Work

**Predictable rate:**

* Know how fast depleting
* Can plan around drain
* Not arbitrary or random

**Player can influence:**

* Avoid damage (defensive play)
* Slow drain (efficiency)
* Counteract with recovery

**Creates pressure:**

* Urgency from depletion
* Must act before runs out
* Tension over time

**Example - HP in Combat:**

* Takes damage from enemies
* Didn't choose to spend HP
* **But:** Can avoid damage through positioning, defense
* **Creates:** Tactical challenge in damage prevention

**Example - Hunger in Survival Games:**

* Depletes automatically over time
* Didn't choose to get hungry
* **But:** Must manage food supply, plan meals
* **Creates:** Resource pressure, survival tension

#### When Passive Drain Works Best

✓ **Good for:**

* Tension aesthetic (mounting pressure)
* Survival gameplay
* Time pressure
* Defense/prevention challenges

✗ **Poor for:**

* Player expression (not choosing use)
* Strategic depth (no spending optimization)
* When feels arbitrary or unavoidable

### Spending Type 3: Automatic Optimization (System-Managed)

**Definition:** System spends resources optimally for player, no conscious choice needed.

**Examples:**

* Auto-battle in mobile games
* Passive abilities (always on, no activation)
* Automatic resource allocation in some strategy games
* Experience points (automatically level up)

#### Characteristics

**Decision point:** None (system handles it)
**Player control:** Minimal to none
**Satisfaction:** From outcomes, not process

#### When Automatic Works

**For non-core gameplay:**

* Grinding/repetitive tasks
* Bookkeeping that isn't interesting
* Tedious micromanagement

**When optimal choice is obvious:**

* Only one viable option
* Choice would be mechanical, not strategic
* Automation removes busywork

**For accessibility:**

* Let players opt into automation
* Simplifies complex systems
* Reduces cognitive load

**Example - XP Auto-Leveling:**

* Gain XP automatically from actions
* Level up when reach threshold (no spending decision)
* **Works because:** Spending XP isn't interesting (always want to level up)
* **Alternative:** Manual leveling with build choices (if customization matters)

⚠️ **Warning:** Automation removes agency. Only automate when choice isn't meaningful or when offering as accessibility option.

#### When Automatic Doesn't Work

✗ **Core gameplay:** If spending resource IS the game, can't automate
✗ **Player expression:** If build/style depends on choices, need manual control
✗ **Challenge aesthetic:** If optimization is the challenge, automation removes it

> **Anti-Pattern: Over-Automation**
> Automating choices that should be player expression or strategic decisions.
>
> **Example:** Auto-spec character builds in RPG
> **Problem:** Removes player identity, one of the reasons to play
> **Fix:** Either make choices more meaningful or accept automation is appropriate

### Spending Type 4: Opportunity Cost (Implicit Spending)

**Definition:** "Spending" resource by choosing not to get it, or by using it one way that prevents another use.

**Examples:**

* Slay the Spire skipping card reward (choose not to "spend" deck slot)
* Taking one path in branching game (can't take other path)
* Blades downtime actions (do this OR that, not both)
* Specialization in skill trees (invest here, not there)

#### Characteristics

**Decision point:** What to pursue/acquire
**Player control:** Indirect (shape what you have)
**Satisfaction:** From long-term build/path

#### What Makes Opportunity Cost Work

**Multiple valuable options:**

* All paths are useful
* No single "best" choice
* Different builds/playstyles viable

**Long-term consequences:**

* Choice affects future options
* Creates commitment
* Specialization emerges

**Meaningful trade-offs:**

* Understand what you're giving up
* Can evaluate relative value
* Risk/reward visible

**Example - Slay the Spire Card Skipping:**

* Offered card after combat
* Can take or skip
* **Opportunity cost:** Taking weak card dilutes deck
* **Choice:** "Does this improve my deck?" not just "Is this good?"
* **Works because:** Quality over quantity, curation is skill

**Example - Blades Downtime Actions:**

* Can recover stress OR heal harm OR advance project
* Can't do all with limited actions
* **Opportunity cost:** Each action chosen prevents others
* **Works because:** Reveals player priorities, character-defining

#### When Opportunity Cost Works Best

✓ **Good for:**

* Mastery aesthetic (optimization through curation)
* Player expression (choices reveal identity)
* Long-term planning
* Replayability (different paths each time)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Short-term gameplay (consequences not felt)
* When all options equivalent (no real choice)
* Submission aesthetic (creates decision stress)

## The Spending Decision Framework

Good resource spending creates this decision structure:

### Step 1: Awareness

**Player knows:**

* How much resource they have
* What spending options exist
* Rough consequences of each option

**Design requirement:** Clear information

* Visible resource levels
* Understandable options
* Predictable outcomes (at least generally)

### Step 2: Evaluation

**Player considers:**

* Immediate benefit vs. future need
* Risk vs. reward
* Alternatives and opportunity costs

**Design requirement:** Meaningful trade-offs

* Multiple viable options
* Different situations favor different choices
* No single dominant strategy

### Step 3: Commitment

**Player decides:**

* Spend now or save
* This option or that option
* Accept consequences

**Design requirement:** Irreversibility (at least short-term)

* Can't undo immediately
* Choice matters
* Creates weight

### Step 4: Feedback

**Player experiences:**

* Consequences of choice
* Success or failure
* Learning for next time

**Design requirement:** Clear causality

* Understand why outcome occurred
* Can improve decision-making
* Not random or arbitrary

### When This Framework Breaks Down

**Missing Awareness:**

* Hidden costs or consequences
* Unclear options
* **Result:** Frustration, can't make informed choice

**Missing Evaluation:**

* Only one viable option
* Obvious best choice
* **Result:** Mechanical execution, no strategy

**Missing Commitment:**

* Can immediately undo choice
* No consequences
* **Result:** Choice doesn't matter

**Missing Feedback:**

* Can't tell if choice was good
* Random outcomes
* **Result:** Can't learn or improve

## Spending Patterns and What They Create

### Pattern 1: Conservative Hoarding

**Behavior:** Save resources for "when really needed"

**Causes:**

* Harsh scarcity (resource very limited)
* Uncertain future (don't know what's coming)
* High consequence (mistakes costly)
* One-time use (can't get more)

**Example:** Never using elixirs in Final Fantasy

* Rare items
* Don't know what future bosses require
* Fear of wasting

**Design implications:**

* If want spending: Reduce uncertainty, enable recovery
* If want hoarding: Make it viable strategy (survival aesthetic)

**Fix for unwanted hoarding:**

* Renewable resources (reduces fear)
* Use-it-or-lose-it pressure (Catan hand limit)
* Clear telegraphing (know what's coming)
* Abundant enough to experiment

### Pattern 2: Aggressive Spending

**Behavior:** Spend resources freely, don't conserve

**Causes:**

* Fast recovery (will get more soon)
* Clear immediate benefit (spending is obviously good)
* Low consequence for running out (just recover)
* Optimization mindset (efficiency > conservation)

**Example:** Modern WoW cooldown usage

* Abilities recover quickly
* Want to use as often as possible
* Holding them wastes potential uses

**Design implications:**

* If want aggressive play: Fast recovery, clear benefits
* If want conservation: Slow recovery, uncertain future needs

### Pattern 3: Optimization

**Behavior:** Calculate optimal use, maximize efficiency

**Causes:**

* Clear optimal strategies exist
* Perfect information available
* Mathematical relationships transparent
* Mastery aesthetic appeals to player

**Example:** Slay the Spire energy optimization

* 3 energy per turn
* Can calculate exact damage/block
* Find optimal card sequence

**Design implications:**

* If want optimization: Provide information, clear math
* If want intuition: Hide information, complex interactions

### Pattern 4: Satisficing

**Behavior:** "Good enough" rather than optimal, prioritize convenience

**Causes:**

* Optimization too complex/tedious
* Good enough succeeds anyway
* Cognitive load too high for optimization
* Not Mastery aesthetic

**Example:** Casual players in strategy games

* Don't calculate exact optimal
* Use heuristics ("this seems fine")
* Succeed without perfection

**Design implications:**

* Support both: Optimization possible but not required
* Multiple difficulty levels
* Accessibility through satisficing, depth through optimization

***

## Spending and Agency Patterns

### High Agency: Build Your Own Strategy

**Pattern:** Players construct unique approaches through spending choices

**Example - Slay the Spire Deck Building:**

* Every card choice shapes deck
* Different builds viable
* Player expression through curation

**Creates:**

* Replayability (different builds each time)
* Player identity (this is MY deck)
* Mastery depth (learn what works)

✓ **Best for:** Mastery, Expression, Challenge aesthetics

### Moderate Agency: Choose Your Path

**Pattern:** Branching paths, must choose between good options

**Example - RPG Skill Trees:**

* Can't max everything
* Must specialize
* Different paths for different playstyles

**Creates:**

* Strategic commitment
* Trade-offs
* Build diversity

✓ **Best for:** Challenge, Expression aesthetics

### Low Agency: Obvious Optimal Choice

**Pattern:** One choice clearly best, others sub-optimal

**Example:** Required upgrades in many games

* Must buy to progress
* No real alternative
* Just gate-keeping

**Creates:**

* Mechanical execution
* Illusion of choice
* Busywork

✗ **Poor for:** Most aesthetics (not engaging)
⚠️ **Consider:** Remove resource entirely if choices aren't meaningful

### No Agency: Automatic or Forced

**Pattern:** Player doesn't choose, system handles

**Example:** Auto-level systems, forced story beats

**Creates:**

* Streamlined experience
* Removes tedium
* But also removes player expression

✓ **Good for:** Non-core systems, accessibility
✗ **Poor for:** Core gameplay, player expression

***

## Spending Complexity vs. Depth

### Complexity: How Many Options/Calculations

**High complexity:**

* Many spending options
* Complex interactions
* Difficult to calculate optimal
* Example: D\&D 3.5e feat selection

**Low complexity:**

* Few spending options
* Simple interactions
* Easy to evaluate
* Example: Binary choice games

### Depth: How Meaningful Choices Are

**High depth:**

* Multiple viable strategies
* No dominant option
* Context determines best choice
* Example: Slay the Spire card play

**Low depth:**

* One clearly best option
* Choice is mechanical
* Context doesn't matter much
* Example: Obvious upgrades

### The Sweet Spot: High Depth, Moderate Complexity

**Goal:** Meaningful choices without overwhelming

**Characteristics:**

* Enough options to create variety
* Not so many that analysis paralysis
* Clear trade-offs
* Context-dependent optimization

**Example - Blades Stress Resistance:**

* Binary choice (resist or don't)
* But meaningful (immediate cost vs. lasting consequence)
* Context-dependent (depends on stress level, consequence severity)
* **Low complexity, high depth**

**Example - Slay the Spire Energy:**

* Moderate complexity (5-10 cards to consider)
* High depth (sequence matters, situation varies)
* Clear information (can calculate)
* **Moderate complexity, high depth**

> **Design Principle:** Prefer depth over complexity. Simple systems with meaningful choices beat complex systems with obvious choices.

***

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Illusion of Choice

> **Anti-Pattern: Fake Decisions**
> Multiple spending options but one obviously best.

**Example:** Upgrade system where one option is 2x better than others

* Appears to be choice
* Actually no decision
* Just gating

**Fix:** Balance options or remove pretense of choice

### Mistake 2: Analysis Paralysis

> **Anti-Pattern: Too Many Options, Unclear Consequences**
> So many spending options that choosing is overwhelming.

**Example:** 100 skills in skill tree, no clear specializations

* Can't evaluate all options
* Unclear what's good
* Paralyzing, not engaging

**Fix:** Reduce options, provide guidance, or make reversible

### Mistake 3: Unclear Causality

> **Anti-Pattern: Can't Tell if Choice Was Good**
> Spend resource but can't evaluate outcome.

**Example:** Stat investment with hidden calculations

* Don't know what "+3 Magic" does
* Can't optimize
* Feels arbitrary

**Fix:** Show effects clearly, enable learning

### Mistake 4: Irrelevant Choices

> **Anti-Pattern: Spending Decisions That Don't Matter**
> Choices exist but don't affect outcomes significantly.

**Example:** Cosmetic-only "choices" presented as strategic

* Game treats as meaningful
* Actually doesn't matter
* Wastes player attention

**Fix:** Either make choices matter or acknowledge they're cosmetic

***

## Summary: Designing Spending and Agency

**Spending types:**

1. **Active choice:** Player directly controls (high engagement)
2. **Passive drain:** Involuntary loss (defensive challenge)
3. **Automatic:** System-managed (reduces busywork)
4. **Opportunity cost:** Implicit through acquisition choices (long-term strategy)

**Good spending decisions require:**

* **Awareness:** Know options and consequences
* **Evaluation:** Meaningful trade-offs
* **Commitment:** Choices matter
* **Feedback:** Can learn from outcomes

**Agency creates engagement:**

* High agency: Build your own strategy
* Moderate agency: Choose your path
* Low agency: Obvious optimal choice (consider removing)
* No agency: Automatic (only for non-core systems)

**Prefer depth over complexity:**

* Meaningful choices with few options
* Better than meaningless choices with many options
* Context-dependent optimization

**Avoid:**

* Illusion of choice (obvious optimal)
* Analysis paralysis (too many options)
* Unclear causality (can't evaluate)
* Irrelevant choices (don't affect outcomes)

**The fundamental test:** "Do spending decisions create interesting strategic choices that serve my aesthetic?"
