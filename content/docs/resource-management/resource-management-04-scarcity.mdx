# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Document 4: Scarcity and Abundance

***

## The Core Dynamic of Resource Management

Resource management exists because of scarcity. Abundant resources require no management. Strategic choices emerge from constraint.

**This document explores:**

* How scarcity creates meaningful decisions
* What happens when resources are abundant
* Finding the right scarcity level for your aesthetic
* Dynamic scarcity (changing over time)

***

## High-Level Principle: Scarcity Creates Strategic Filtering

✅ **Validated across all analyzed games**

**Principle:** When resources are scarce, players must prioritize. This prioritization IS the strategic gameplay. Remove scarcity, remove decisions. Create too much scarcity, remove options.

**The continuum:**

* **Abundant:** No choices needed (everything possible)
* **Moderate scarcity:** Interesting choices (must prioritize)
* **Severe scarcity:** Few options (constrained)
* **None:** Blocked entirely (no agency)

**Implication:** Design scarcity level to match desired decision complexity.

***

## Understanding Scarcity

### What Makes a Resource Scarce?

**Four factors create scarcity:**

1. **Limited supply** (can't get more easily)
2. **Multiple demands** (many uses for same resource)
3. **Opportunity cost** (choosing one prevents another)
4. **Time pressure** (can't wait forever)

**All four together:** Maximum scarcity
**Any one alone:** Moderate scarcity
**None:** Abundance (no scarcity)

### Example: Army Units in HoMM3

**Limited supply:** Weekly recruitment caps
**Multiple demands:** Need units for attack, defense, exploration
**Opportunity cost:** Units used in one battle unavailable for another
**Time pressure:** Opponent is also building army

**Result:** High scarcity creates high-stakes decisions

### Example: Energy in Slay the Spire

**Limited supply:** 3 energy per turn (fixed)
**Multiple demands:** Multiple cards to play
**Opportunity cost:** Play this card, can't play that one
**Time pressure:** Must decide this turn

**Result:** Tactical optimization puzzle

### Example: Gold in Late-Game RPG

**Limited supply:** ❌ (earning is easy)
**Multiple demands:** ❌ (can afford everything)
**Opportunity cost:** ❌ (no meaningful trade-offs)
**Time pressure:** ❌ (no urgency)

**Result:** Gold becomes meaningless (false scarcity)

> **Note:** Even "scarce" resources become abundant if acquisition outpaces spending. Late-game wealth is common problem.

## The Scarcity Spectrum

### Level 1: Abundance (No Scarcity)

**Characteristics:**

* Resources freely available
* No need to choose between options
* Can do everything

**Strategic impact:** None (no decisions)

**When to use:**

* Resources you DON'T want players thinking about
* Things that should be automatic
* Removing barriers to intended gameplay

**Examples:**

* Unlimited movement in exploration-focused game (movement not the challenge)
* Infinite mana in power fantasy game (want ability spam)
* Modern WoW healing (keeps players in combat, not resting)

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Submission (no stress from scarcity)
* ✓ Fantasy (if scarcity would break immersion)
* ✗ Challenge (no optimization possible)

### Level 2: Gentle Scarcity

**Characteristics:**

* Resources sufficient for core needs
* Must choose between bonus/optional goals
* Rarely run out completely

**Strategic impact:** Mild (comfort zone with occasional choices)

**When to use:**

* Want accessibility without trivialization
* Core gameplay should flow, extras are choices
* Forgiving experience

**Examples:**

* Catan resources (production is regular, but must choose which building)
* D\&D 5e spell slots (enough for normal encounters, must conserve for hard days)
* Many puzzle games (moves sufficient if playing reasonably)

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Fellowship (simple enough for socializing)
* ✓ Discovery (can explore without constant resource stress)
* \~ Challenge (light optimization)

### Level 3: Moderate Scarcity

**Characteristics:**

* Resources sufficient for EITHER this OR that, not both
* Constant meaningful choices
* Running out is possible but avoidable with skill

**Strategic impact:** High (the sweet spot for many games)

**When to use:**

* Challenge/Mastery aesthetic
* Want optimization without overwhelming
* Meaningful trade-offs

**Examples:**

* Slay the Spire energy (can play some cards, must choose which)
* Blades downtime actions (can recover OR advance, not both)
* Catan trades (must negotiate to get what you need)

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Challenge (meaningful optimization)
* ✓ Mastery (rewards efficiency)
* ✓ Tension (pressure without overwhelming)

**This is the "default" scarcity level for most strategy games.**

### Level 4: Severe Scarcity

**Characteristics:**

* Resources barely sufficient
* Can afford only most essential
* Running out is common threat

**Strategic impact:** Intense (every choice critical)

**When to use:**

* High-tension gameplay
* Survival aesthetics
* Punishing strategic depth

**Examples:**

* HoMM3 army units (permanent loss, must be very careful)
* Old-school D\&D HP (healing rare, must retreat often)
* Slay the Spire HP on high difficulties (every hit hurts)

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Tension (constant pressure)
* ✓ Challenge (unforgiving optimization)
* ✗ Submission (too stressful)
* ✗ Fellowship (if individual, too much pressure for social play)

### Level 5: Critical Scarcity (Blockage)

**Characteristics:**

* Resources insufficient for progress
* Running out blocks gameplay
* Must grind or restart

**Strategic impact:** Negative (frustration, not challenge)

**When to use:**

* **Never for critical path**
* Only for optional challenges

**Examples (all anti-patterns):**

* Required item used up, can't progress (bad adventure game design)
* Investigation system where failed check blocks mystery (bad mystery design)
* Boss requires specific consumable you might not have (bad difficulty spike)

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✗ ALL aesthetics (blockage is not gameplay)

> **Anti-Pattern: Critical Path Blockage**
> Never let resource depletion block core progress. Players should fail challenges, not be blocked from attempting them.

## Finding Your Scarcity Sweet Spot

### Design Process

**Step 1: Define your aesthetic goal**

* What experience do you want players to have?
* Which aesthetic(s) are you serving?

**Step 2: Determine desired decision frequency**

* Constant choices? (high scarcity)
* Occasional choices? (moderate scarcity)
* Rare choices? (gentle scarcity)
* No choices? (abundance)

**Step 3: Set scarcity level**

* Based on Steps 1 and 2
* Start conservative (less scarce), tune up

**Step 4: Test failure modes**

* What happens if players run out?
* Is it interesting problem or dead end?
* Can players recover or must restart?

**Step 5: Iterate**

* Too easy? Increase scarcity
* Too frustrating? Decrease scarcity
* Wrong type of challenge? Rethink resource

### Example: Tuning Investigation Points (Gumshoe)

**Aesthetic goal:** Mystery investigation (interpretation challenge, not resource management)

**Desired decision frequency:** Occasional (when to investigate deeply)

**Scarcity level:** Gentle

* Enough points for reasonable investigation
* Must choose where to spend for depth
* Never blocks core clues

**Failure mode:** Running out means less detail, not stuck

**Result:** Scarcity creates depth choices without blocking progress

### Example: Tuning Army Units (HoMM3)

**Aesthetic goal:** Strategic warfare (high-stakes battles)

**Desired decision frequency:** Constant (every battle is decision)

**Scarcity level:** Severe

* Weekly recruitment (limited supply)
* Permanent loss (no recovery)
* Multiple fronts (multiple demands)

**Failure mode:** Running out means must retreat, rebuild (interesting problem)

**Result:** Scarcity creates meaningful stakes for every engagement

***

## Multiple Demands: Creating Opportunity Cost

**Scarcity alone isn't enough.** Resource must have multiple valuable uses.

### Single Use Resource (No Opportunity Cost)

**Example:** Currency that only buys one thing

* Have gold, can only buy swords
* No decision: "Do I have enough?" not "What should I buy?"
* No strategic depth

### Multiple Use Resource (Opportunity Cost)

**Example:** Gold buys multiple item types

* Have 100 gold
* Can buy: Sword (100g) OR Armor (80g) + Potions (20g)
* Decision: Offense or defense?
* Strategic depth

**The principle:** More valuable uses = more interesting scarcity

### Example: Energy in Slay the Spire

**Multiple demands on 3 energy:**

* Play attack cards (deal damage)
* Play defense cards (block damage)
* Play skill cards (special effects)
* Each turn: Different optimal combination

**What creates depth:**

* Can't do everything
* Must prioritize based on situation
* No single "best" answer

### Example: Downtime Actions in Blades

**Multiple demands on 2-4 actions:**

* Recover stress (survival)
* Heal harm (recovery)
* Work on project (advancement)
* Train ability (growth)
* Indulge vice (stress relief + risk)

**What creates depth:**

* Can't do all
* Different characters have different priorities
* Reveals player values

***

## Dynamic Scarcity: Changing Over Time

**Static scarcity:** Same throughout game
**Dynamic scarcity:** Changes based on game state

### Types of Dynamic Scarcity

#### 1. Progression-Based (Abundance Increases)

**Pattern:** Start scarce, become abundant

**Examples:**

* RPG gold (scarce early, abundant late)
* Character abilities (few early, many late)
* Building resources in strategy games

**What it creates:**

* Early game: Tough choices (scarcity)
* Late game: Power fantasy (abundance)
* Sense of progression

**Problem:** Late game can become trivial if too abundant

**Fix:** Scale demands with supply (bigger challenges need more resources)

#### 2. Attrition-Based (Scarcity Increases)

**Pattern:** Start abundant, become scarce

**Examples:**

* HP in dungeon crawl (depletes over time)
* Limited healing in survival game
* Dwindling supplies

**What it creates:**

* Early game: Comfortable (can afford mistakes)
* Late game: Tense (every resource precious)
* Mounting pressure

**Problem:** Can become frustrating if too punishing

**Fix:** Provide replenishment opportunities, or make scarcity the point (survival aesthetic)

#### 3. Cyclical (Alternating)

**Pattern:** Periods of scarcity and abundance alternate

**Examples:**

* Catan production (feast or famine based on dice)
* Quest rewards in RPGs (scarce during quest, abundant after)
* Seasonal resources

**What it creates:**

* Varied pacing
* Planning around cycles
* Adaptation to changing conditions

**Good for:** Long-form games needing pacing variation

#### 4. Crisis-Based (Sudden Scarcity)

**Pattern:** Normal abundance disrupted by events

**Examples:**

* Catan robber (suddenly blocks production)
* Resource denial in competitive games
* Boss phases that limit resources

**What it creates:**

* Adaptation challenge
* Disruption of routine
* Heightened tension

**Good for:** Creating memorable moments, forcing strategic shifts

### Designing Dynamic Scarcity

**Question:** "Should scarcity change over time?"

**Consider:**

* **Progression aesthetic:** Yes (start scarce → abundant feels like growth)
* **Tension aesthetic:** Yes (start abundant → scarce creates mounting pressure)
* **Challenge aesthetic:** Maybe (if want difficulty curve)
* **Fellowship aesthetic:** Maybe not (consistency enables social focus)

**If yes, consider:**

* Direction (more or less scarce?)
* Rate of change (gradual or sudden?)
* Player control (can they influence?)
* Recovery mechanisms (can reverse?)

***

## Scarcity and Player Psychology

### The Hoarding Problem

**Observation:** Players hoard consumables "for emergencies" that never come.

**Why it happens:**

* Loss aversion (spent resource can't be recovered)
* Uncertainty (don't know what's coming)
* Optimization mindset (want perfect use)

**Examples:**

* Potions in Skyrim (saved until game is over)
* Elixirs in Final Fantasy (never used)
* Powerful consumables everywhere

**What creates hoarding:**

* One-time use (pressure to use "correctly")
* Limited availability (can't get more)
* Unclear future needs (might need later)
* Harsh difficulty (can't afford waste)

**Solutions to hoarding:**

**Solution 1: Use-it-or-lose-it pressure**

* Example: Catan hand limit (can't hoard safely)
* Forces spending before accumulation
* Creates flow instead of hoarding

**Solution 2: Renewable resources**

* Example: Blades stress (recovers between scores)
* Safe to spend (will get more)
* Encourages use over hoarding

**Solution 3: Degradation over time**

* Example: Food spoils, potions expire
* Must use before lost anyway
* Incentivizes consumption

**Solution 4: Abundant enough to experiment**

* Example: Modern games with generous consumables
* Players feel safe trying things
* Removes anxiety around spending

✅ **Validated:** Hoarding correlates with harsh scarcity + one-time use

### The FOMO Problem

**FOMO:** Fear Of Missing Out

**When resources create FOMO:**

* Time-limited availability (must act now)
* Unknown optimal choice (might pick wrong)
* Irreversible decisions (can't change later)
* Hidden information (don't know all options)

**Example - WoW Daily Quests:**

* Must complete today or miss rewards
* Falls behind who did complete
* Creates obligation, not excitement

**Example - Skill Trees:**

* Must commit points
* Don't know if choice is good
* Can't respec (or costs heavily)
* Paralysis from fear of wrong choice

**Solutions to FOMO:**

**Solution 1: Transparency**

* Show what options exist
* Explain consequences clearly
* Let players make informed choices

**Solution 2: Reversibility**

* Allow respec/rewind
* Reduce commitment weight
* Enable experimentation

**Solution 3: Multiple paths work**

* No "trap" choices
* All options viable
* Removes optimization pressure

**Solution 4: Remove time pressure**

* No daily/weekly lockouts for critical progress
* Let players engage at their pace

⚠️ **Hypothesis:** FOMO from scarcity can drive engagement (games-as-service) but often feels manipulative

### The Wealth Problem

**Observation:** Late-game wealth trivializes strategic choices.

**Why it happens:**

* Income accumulates faster than spending
* Costs don't scale with wealth
* No meaningful money sinks

**Example - RPG gold:**

* Early: 100g is meaningful, must choose purchases
* Late: 100,000g, buy everything without thought
* Gold becomes meaningless

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Scaling costs**

* Late-game items cost proportionally more
* Maintains relative scarcity

**Solution 2: Money sinks**

* Ongoing expenses (upkeep, taxes)
* Prestige purchases (cosmetics)
* Competitive expenses (outbid others)

**Solution 3: Conversion to other resources**

* Gold → buy time (hire help)
* Gold → buy power (permanent upgrades)
* Creates continued utility

**Solution 4: Accept it**

* Late game power fantasy INCLUDES wealth
* Let players feel rich
* Not everything needs to be challenging

✅ **Validated:** Wealth accumulation is common challenge in long-form games with economic systems

***

## Scarcity in Competitive vs Cooperative Games

### Competitive Scarcity (Zero-Sum)

**Characteristic:** Your resource gain is opponent's loss (or vice versa)

**Examples:**

* Catan: Limited board space, robber steals from others
* Territory control: Control this mine OR opponent does, not both
* Auction games: Outbid others for limited goods

**What it creates:**

* Direct competition
* Denial strategies (prevent opponent access)
* Tension from conflict

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Challenge (optimize against opposition)
* ✓ Tension (conflict)
* \~ Fellowship (competitive socializing, not cooperative)

### Cooperative Scarcity (Shared Challenge)

**Characteristic:** All players face same scarcity, must work together

**Examples:**

* Pandemic: Limited actions to stop diseases
* Blades crew resources: Shared coin, shared problems
* Co-op survival: Limited supplies for whole team

**What it creates:**

* Collaborative problem-solving
* Shared triumph/defeat
* Social bonding through challenge

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Fellowship (cooperation)
* ✓ Challenge (overcome together)
* ✓ Narrative (shared story)

### Mixed Scarcity (Cooperative with Competition)

**Characteristic:** Cooperate against challenge, compete for rewards

**Examples:**

* WoW raiding: Work together to kill boss, compete for loot drops
* Board games with shared threat + individual victory

**What it creates:**

* Complex social dynamics
* Tension between cooperation and self-interest
* Can breed toxicity if poorly designed

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* \~ Mixed (depends on balance)
* ⚠️ Risk of conflict

> **Warning:** Mixed scarcity can create toxic dynamics if cooperation is essential but rewards are competitive. Players resent helping others who get better rewards.

***

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: False Scarcity

> **Anti-Pattern: Theoretical Limits That Never Bind**
> Resource appears scarce in design but is abundant in practice.

**Example:** Mana bar that never runs empty

* Nominally limited resource
* Actually always sufficient
* Players learn to ignore it

**Fix:** Either make scarcity real or remove the resource

### Mistake 2: Runaway Abundance

> **Anti-Pattern: Accumulation Without Sinks**
> Resources accumulate faster than spent, becomes meaningless.

**Example:** Late-game RPG wealth

* Gold piles up
* Nothing worth buying
* Strategic depth evaporates

**Fix:** Scale costs, add sinks, or accept power fantasy

### Mistake 3: Critical Path Blockage

> **Anti-Pattern: Can't Progress Due to Resource Depletion**
> Spent resources thinking they were optional, now can't proceed.

**Example:** Used key item earlier, needed for final boss

* Player stuck
* Must restart or grind
* Feels like punishment for playing

**Fix:** Never gate critical path with consumable resources

### Mistake 4: Whiplash Scarcity

> **Anti-Pattern: Scarcity Level Changes Too Dramatically**
> Resource goes from abundant to scarce (or vice versa) too quickly.

**Example:** Game is generous with resources, then sudden spike of difficulty

* Players weren't conserving (no need to before)
* Suddenly can't progress (unprepared)
* Feels unfair (rules changed mid-game)

**Fix:** Gradual scarcity changes, or telegraph changes clearly

***

## Summary: Designing Scarcity

**The scarcity spectrum:**

1. Abundance → No decisions
2. Gentle → Occasional choices
3. Moderate → Constant choices (sweet spot for many games)
4. Severe → Every choice critical
5. Critical → Blockage (avoid for critical path)

**Scarcity created by:**

* Limited supply
* Multiple demands
* Opportunity cost
* Time pressure

**Choose scarcity level based on:**

* Aesthetic goals
* Desired decision frequency
* Acceptable failure modes

**Dynamic scarcity patterns:**

* Progression (scarce → abundant)
* Attrition (abundant → scarce)
* Cyclical (alternating)
* Crisis (sudden changes)

**Avoid:**

* False scarcity (theoretical only)
* Critical path blockage (can't progress)
* Runaway abundance (becomes meaningless)
* Whiplash changes (too sudden)

**The fundamental test:** "Does this scarcity level create the strategic experience I want?"
