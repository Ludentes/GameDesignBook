# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Document 3: Types of Resources

***

## Understanding Resource Categories

Not all resources work the same way. Different types of resources create different player experiences, serve different aesthetic goals, and require different design approaches.

This document categorizes resources by their **behavioral patterns** - how they're acquired, spent, and what strategic dynamics they create.

**Why categorize?**

* Understand what each type is good for
* Choose appropriate type for your aesthetic
* Avoid mixing incompatible patterns

***

## High-Level Principle: Resource Type Shapes Strategic Space

✅ **Validated across multiple games**

**Principle:** The fundamental behavior of a resource (how it's acquired, spent, recovered) creates different strategic landscapes. Changing resource type changes the game dramatically, even if fiction stays the same.

**Example:**

* **HP as depleting pool** (D\&D): Gradual damage, tactical positioning
* **HP as wound slots** (Blades harm): Specific injuries, narrative consequences
* **Same fiction** (character taking damage), **different strategic experience**

***

## The Five Primary Resource Types

### Type 1: Consumable Resources

**Definition:** Resources that are spent/used up and must be replenished or replaced.

**Core dynamic:** Spend now or save for later

**Examples:**

* HP (depletes in combat)
* Mana/Spell slots (spent to use abilities)
* Gold (spent on purchases)
* Potions (one-time use)
* Investigation points (Gumshoe)
* Army units (HoMM3 - permanently lost)

#### Key Characteristics

**Acquisition:**

* Gained through gameplay (loot, rewards, production)
* Finite per time period or per source

**Spending:**

* Direct use depletes resource
* Creates opportunity cost (spend here = can't spend there)

**Recovery:**

* Varies by design (fast, slow, none, or requires investment)
* Recovery rate is critical design parameter

#### Strategic Patterns Created

**Optimization:** "What's the most efficient use?"

* Calculate expected value
* Minimize waste
* Example: Using strongest spell slots on toughest encounters

**Conservation:** "Can I afford to spend this now?"

* Save for later uncertainty
* Risk running out vs. using suboptimally
* Example: Hoarding potions "for the boss fight"

**Attrition:** "Resources dwindle over time"

* Pressure mounts as resources deplete
* Creates tension through scarcity
* Example: HP carrying across battles in old D\&D

#### Aesthetic Alignment

✓ **Best for:**

* Challenge (optimization, resource management)
* Tension (pressure from depletion)
* Mastery (calculating optimal use)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Submission (scarcity creates stress, not relaxation)
* Fellowship (if individual resources, creates competition)

\~ **Depends on implementation:**

* Narrative (can work if depletion tells story - Blades harm)
* Fantasy (works if doesn't interrupt immersion)

#### Design Considerations

**Fast recovery (per encounter):**

* Example: Mana in modern WoW (regenerates quickly)
* Creates: Tactical resource management within encounter
* Good for: High-tempo gameplay

**Slow recovery (per session/campaign):**

* Example: HP in old-school D\&D (hard to heal)
* Creates: Strategic attrition across adventure
* Good for: High-stakes gameplay

**No recovery (permanent loss):**

* Example: Army units in HoMM3
* Creates: Maximum tension, every loss matters
* Good for: Strategic depth, meaningful consequences

> **Note:** Recovery rate fundamentally changes player psychology. Fast recovery encourages aggressive play, slow recovery encourages conservation, no recovery creates extreme caution.

***

### Type 2: Buffer Resources

**Definition:** Resources that protect against consequences but don't directly enable actions. They absorb costs rather than pay for benefits.

**Core dynamic:** How much safety margin do I maintain?

**Examples:**

* HP (as buffer against death)
* Shields/Armor (absorb damage)
* Stress in Blades (resist consequences)
* Insurance/contingency funds
* Defensive resources

#### Key Characteristics

**Acquisition:**

* Built up in preparation for danger
* Often slower to acquire than deplete

**Spending:**

* Involuntary (damage happens to you)
* Or voluntary (choose to spend buffer to avoid worse outcome)

**Recovery:**

* Usually requires safe period or investment
* Sometimes only partial recovery possible

#### Strategic Patterns Created

**Risk Management:** "How much buffer is enough?"

* Balance offense vs. defense
* Know when you're safe to take risks
* Example: Attacking in D\&D when HP is high

**Push-Your-Luck:** "Can I go one more round?"

* Continue risky activity while buffer lasts
* Tension between greed and safety
* Example: Blades characters taking stress to succeed

**Preparation:** "Build buffer before danger"

* Invest in protection before needed
* Insurance mindset
* Example: Buying healing potions before dungeon

#### Blades Innovation: Separated Buffer

**Traditional HP (combined):**

* HP represents both protection capacity AND health state
* As HP depletes, you're "less healthy" (narratively) but mechanically unchanged until 0

**Blades Stress/Harm (separated):**

* **Stress:** Protection capacity (can spend to resist)
* **Harm:** Actual injury (narrative + mechanical consequences)
* **Different recovery rates:** Stress fast, harm slow

**What this creates:**

* Agency: Choose whether to accept harm or spend stress
* Narrative arc: Accumulate harm over campaign (veteran effect)
* Tactical depth: Two resources to manage instead of one

✅ **Validated innovation:** Stress/harm separation creates meaningfully different play experience

#### Aesthetic Alignment

✓ **Best for:**

* Tension (buffer depletion creates pressure)
* Challenge (risk management decisions)
* Narrative (when buffer loss tells story - Blades stress/trauma)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Submission (anxiety from buffer depletion)
* Discovery (buffer management distracts from exploration)

#### Design Considerations

**How much buffer is "enough"?**

* Too much: Never feel threatened (no tension)
* Too little: Always feels precarious (too stressful)
* Sweet spot: Can recover from mistakes but can't ignore danger

**Should buffer be visible to players?**

* Visible (D\&D HP): Players can calculate risk
* Hidden (some horror games): Unknown danger level creates fear
* Trade-off: Strategic play vs. emotional tension

***

### Type 3: Accumulation Resources

**Definition:** Resources primarily gained and increased over time, rarely or never spent. Growth is the point.

**Core dynamic:** Progress through collection

**Examples:**

* Experience points / levels
* Reputation
* Unlocked abilities
* Collection progress (Pokémon)
* Score/points in many games
* Relics in Slay the Spire

#### Key Characteristics

**Acquisition:**

* Steady gains over time
* Usually no (or very limited) spending

**Spending:**

* Often can't be spent at all
* Or spent only on permanent upgrades
* Once gained, typically permanent

**Recovery:**

* N/A (doesn't deplete)
* Can only accumulate, not lose

#### Strategic Patterns Created

**Progression:** "I'm getting stronger"

* Power fantasy through accumulation
* Visible growth over time
* Example: Leveling up in RPGs

**Collection:** "Gotta catch 'em all"

* Completionism drive
* Hunting for missing pieces
* Example: Pokédex completion

**Investment:** "Building toward goal"

* Save up for milestone
* Delayed gratification
* Example: Saving gold for expensive item

**Specialization:** "Choosing my path"

* Spend on specific upgrades
* Creates build diversity
* Example: Skill trees in RPGs

#### Accumulation vs. Consumption

**Key distinction:** Accumulation resources grow, consumable resources cycle.

**Why it matters:**

* Accumulation creates power curve
* Consumption creates strategic choices
* Different aesthetic experiences

**Example - Experience vs. Gold:**

* Experience: Pure accumulation (never spend XP, only gain)
* Gold: Consumable (earn and spend in cycle)
* **Both valuable:** Different purposes

#### Aesthetic Alignment

✓ **Best for:**

* Progression (that's the point!)
* Collection (completion goals)
* Mastery (building optimal progression)
* Fantasy (becoming more powerful)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Challenge (if too easy to accumulate, trivializes difficulty)
* Tension (steady growth reduces pressure)

\~ **Depends on implementation:**

* Narrative (works if progression tells story)

#### Design Considerations

**Linear vs. Exponential growth:**

* Linear: Steady power increase (predictable)
* Exponential: Snowballing power (can break balance)
* Trade-off: Satisfying growth vs. maintainable difficulty

**Permanent vs. Respeccable:**

* Permanent: Choices matter forever (commitment)
* Respeccable: Can change later (experimentation-friendly)
* Trade-off: Weight of decision vs. freedom to experiment

**Cap or no cap:**

* Capped: Eventually "max out" (completion goal)
* Uncapped: Infinite progression (endless chase)
* Trade-off: Sense of completion vs. always more to do

***

### Type 4: Composition Resources

**Definition:** Resources where the combination and arrangement matter more than quantity. Quality and synergy over accumulation.

**Core dynamic:** Curation over collection

**Examples:**

* Deck in Slay the Spire (specific cards matter, thin often better)
* Team composition in strategy games
* Equipment loadout (item synergies)
* Ability selection (limited slots)
* Character builds (stat allocation)

#### Key Characteristics

**Acquisition:**

* Choose what to add carefully
* Can often skip additions
* Sometimes can remove/replace

**Spending:**

* "Spending" is more like "investing in composition"
* Adding can make system worse (if wrong choice)
* Curation is skill

**Recovery:**

* Often can't undo choices (or costs resources to undo)
* Build emerges over time

#### Strategic Patterns Created

**Synergy Building:** "How do pieces work together?"

* Look for combinations
* Whole greater than sum of parts
* Example: Slay the Spire card synergies

**Curation:** "Less is more"

* Knowing when NOT to add
* Quality over quantity
* Example: Removing weak cards from Slay the Spire deck

**Build Diversity:** "Many paths to success"

* Different compositions for different strategies
* Replayability through variety
* Example: Different character builds in RPGs

**Long-term Planning:** "Building toward archetype"

* Early choices shape later options
* Commitment to strategy
* Example: Choosing class/specialization

#### Composition vs. Accumulation

**Critical difference:**

* Accumulation: More is better (collect everything)
* Composition: Better is better (curate carefully)

**Why it matters:**

* Composition creates skill in curation
* Accumulation creates skill in efficient gain
* Different optimization challenges

**Example - Slay the Spire:**

* Not about having most cards
* About having RIGHT cards that work together
* Adding powerful card can make deck worse (if doesn't fit)

#### Aesthetic Alignment

✓ **Best for:**

* Mastery (optimization through curation)
* Challenge (meaningful long-term decisions)
* Expression (build reflects player identity)
* Discovery (finding synergies)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Submission (requires thought and planning)
* Collection (if goal is possessing everything)

\~ **Depends on implementation:**

* Narrative (can work if build tells story)
* Progression (works but different from pure accumulation)

#### Design Considerations

**Can players undo choices?**

* Irreversible: Commitment (weight of decisions)
* Reversible: Experimentation (freedom to try)
* Costly to reverse: Middle ground
* Trade-off: Decision weight vs. experimentation

**How many viable compositions?**

* Few: Optimization puzzle (find the best)
* Many: Expression space (choose your style)
* Trade-off: Depth vs. accessibility

**Is there anti-synergy?**

* Yes: Curation is critical (wrong choices hurt)
* No: Just avoid best synergies (less skill)
* Trade-off: Punishment for mistakes vs. forgiveness

***

### Type 5: Capacity Resources

**Definition:** Resources that determine limits on other systems. They gate what's possible rather than being directly spent.

**Core dynamic:** Expanding what you can do

**Examples:**

* Inventory slots (how much can you carry)
* Building slots (what can you construct)
* Party size (how many characters)
* Deck size limits
* Action slot limits (abilities equipped)

#### Key Characteristics

**Acquisition:**

* Often requires investment/upgrade
* Sometimes fixed limits

**Spending:**

* Don't spend directly
* Enable spending of other resources

**Recovery:**

* Usually permanent increases
* Rarely decrease

#### Strategic Patterns Created

**Constraint Management:** "What fits within limits?"

* Prioritize what to include
* Opportunity cost of each slot
* Example: Choosing which abilities to equip

**Expansion Investment:** "Buying capacity vs. using it"

* Invest in more capacity
* Or use current capacity better
* Example: Buying bigger bags vs. better items

**Optimization Puzzle:** "Maximum value per slot"

* Efficiency in limited space
* Value density matters
* Example: Packing inventory efficiently

#### Capacity vs. Other Resource Types

**Capacity enables, doesn't provide:**

* Capacity: Inventory slots (can carry X items)
* Consumable: The items themselves
* Different strategic layers

**Example - Slay the Spire:**

* Potion capacity: Usually 3 slots (capacity resource)
* Potions themselves: Consumable resources
* Must choose: Which 3 potions to keep?

#### Aesthetic Alignment

✓ **Best for:**

* Mastery (optimization within constraints)
* Challenge (meaningful limits force choices)
* Progression (expanding capacity feels like growth)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Submission (managing capacity adds complexity)
* Fellowship (unless shared capacity creates negotiation)

\~ **Neutral for most aesthetics** (depends on how intrusive)

#### Design Considerations

**Fixed vs. expandable capacity:**

* Fixed: Constraint is constant (must work within)
* Expandable: Can invest to increase (progression)
* Trade-off: Permanent puzzle vs. growth satisfaction

**How tight should limits be?**

* Very tight: Constant constraint (always matters)
* Generous: Rarely binding (matters only sometimes)
* Trade-off: Constant decisions vs. occasional pruning

## Hybrid Resources: Multiple Types at Once

Many resources exhibit characteristics of multiple types. Understanding which aspects dominate helps design better.

### Example: HP as Buffer + Consumable

**HP in most games:**

* **Buffer:** Protects against death
* **Consumable:** Depletes and must be recovered

**Why both?**

* Buffer aspect: Creates risk management
* Consumable aspect: Creates resource management (healing)
* Combined: Rich strategic space

### Example: Gold as Consumable + Accumulation

**Gold in RPGs:**

* **Consumable:** Spend on purchases
* **Accumulation:** Having more is progress metric

**Tension:**

* Save to feel rich (accumulation drive)
* Spend to gain power (consumable utility)
* Creates: Satisfying spending decisions

### Example: Reputation as Accumulation + Capacity

**Reputation in WoW:**

* **Accumulation:** Increases over time (never decreases)
* **Capacity:** Unlocks access to vendors/content

**Why both?**

* Accumulation: Progression satisfaction
* Capacity: Gates content (must earn access)
* Combined: Progression with unlocks

### Design Consideration: Dominant Type

**When resource has multiple type characteristics, one usually dominates:**

**Question:** "What's the primary player interaction?"

* If mainly spent/depleted → Consumable
* If mainly protects → Buffer
* If mainly increases → Accumulation
* If mainly matters through synergy → Composition
* If mainly gates other systems → Capacity

**Design tip:** Understand dominant type, but leverage secondary characteristics for depth.

***

## Choosing Resource Type for Your Aesthetic

### For Challenge Aesthetic

**Best types:**

* **Consumable:** Optimization decisions
* **Composition:** Curation skill
* **Buffer:** Risk management

**Why:** These create strategic decision-making

**Example:** Slay the Spire uses all three

* Energy: Consumable (per-turn resource)
* HP: Buffer (risk management)
* Deck: Composition (curation)

### For Progression Aesthetic

**Best types:**

* **Accumulation:** Growth over time
* **Capacity:** Expanding limits

**Why:** These create sense of advancement

**Example:** RPGs typically use both

* XP/Levels: Accumulation (getting stronger)
* Inventory/Abilities: Capacity (can do more)

### For Narrative Aesthetic

**Best types:**

* **Buffer** (if loss tells story): Stress/trauma accumulation
* **Consumable** (if sacrifice matters): Spending resources for success

**Why:** These can mechanize character arc

**Example:** Blades in the Dark

* Stress/Harm: Buffer (getting worn down)
* Coin: Consumable (what you're willing to spend)

### For Fellowship Aesthetic

**Best types:**

* **Consumable** (if shared or tradeable): Creates interdependence
* **Accumulation** (if competitive): Creates rivalry

**Why:** These create social dynamics

**Example:** Catan

* Resources: Consumable + tradeable (negotiation)
* Victory points: Accumulation + competitive (racing)

### For Tension Aesthetic

**Best types:**

* **Buffer** (depleting): Mounting pressure
* **Consumable** (slow recovery): High stakes

**Why:** Scarcity creates tension

**Example:** Slay the Spire

* HP: Buffer with slow recovery (permanent consequences)
* Limited campfires: Scarcity creates tough choices

### For Mastery Aesthetic

**Best types:**

* **Composition:** Optimization puzzle
* **Consumable:** Efficiency challenges

**Why:** These reward system understanding

**Example:** Card games

* Deck: Composition (synergy building)
* Hand management: Consumable (optimal sequencing)

***

## Common Mistakes in Resource Type Selection

### Mistake 1: Using Accumulation When Need Consumption

> **Anti-Pattern: Growth Without Spending**
> Making resources that only accumulate when gameplay needs spending decisions.

**Problem:** If resources never get spent, no meaningful choices about allocation.

**Example:** Game where you only gain gold, never spend it

* Gold becomes just score
* No "buy this or that" decisions
* Misses economic gameplay

**Fix:** Either add meaningful spending OR recognize it's accumulation (score/progress) not economy.

### Mistake 2: Using Consumable When Need Buffer

> **Anti-Pattern: Direct Spending for Protection**
> Making players actively spend to avoid damage when buffer would be more intuitive.

**Problem:** Players want protection to be passive, not active decision every time.

**Example:** Game where you must spend resource to block EVERY attack

* Tedious: Every hit requires decision
* Not strategic: Obvious to always block
* Compare to: HP buffer (absorbs damage automatically)

**Fix:** Use buffer for passive protection, consumable for active abilities.

### Mistake 3: Using Composition When Accumulation Expected

> **Anti-Pattern: Punishing Collection**
> Making "more" worse when aesthetic suggests it should be better.

**Problem:** Players expect accumulation to be rewarded, but composition punishes bloat.

**Example:** RPG where gaining items makes character weaker (carry weight penalties)

* Feels bad: Punished for rewards
* Conflicts with: Collection drive in RPG genre
* Works in: Survival games where scarcity is aesthetic

**Fix:** Match resource type to genre expectations, or make aesthetic clear upfront.

### Mistake 4: Mixed Signals in Hybrid Resources

> **Anti-Pattern: Unclear Resource Purpose**
> Resource acts like multiple types but unclear which aspect matters.

**Example:** Currency that's both spent and counts as score

* Confusing: Should I save (score) or spend (utility)?
* Unclear: What's the goal?

**Fix:** Make primary purpose clear, secondary purpose bonus.

***

## Summary: Resource Type Selection

**The five primary types:**

1. **Consumable:** Spend and replenish (optimization, scarcity)
2. **Buffer:** Protect against consequences (risk management)
3. **Accumulation:** Grow over time (progression, collection)
4. **Composition:** Quality > quantity (curation, synergy)
5. **Capacity:** Enable other resources (expansion, limits)

**Choosing type:**

1. What aesthetic are you serving?
2. What strategic dynamic do you want?
3. What player interaction makes sense?

**Resources can be hybrids:**

* Multiple type characteristics
* One usually dominates
* Secondary adds depth

**Common mistakes:**

* Wrong type for aesthetic
* Unclear hybrid purpose
* Conflicting type signals

**The test:** "Does this resource's behavior create the experience I want?"

**Next:** Document 4 - Scarcity and Abundance

Now that we understand resource types, we'll explore how scarcity and abundance shape strategic choices and player psychology.
