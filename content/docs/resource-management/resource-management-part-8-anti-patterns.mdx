# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Part 8: Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

***

## Overview

This section consolidates anti-patterns and common mistakes in resource design that we've observed across game systems. Each anti-pattern includes:

* What the problem is
* Why it emerges
* Examples from real games
* How to recognize it in your design
* Solutions or alternatives

Anti-patterns are organized by the type of problem they create:

1. **Progress Blockers** - Resources that prevent advancement
2. **Experience Underminders** - Resources that harm intended aesthetic
3. **Engagement Killers** - Resources that create tedium or frustration
4. **Social Toxicity** - Resources that damage community
5. **Manipulative Design** - Resources that exploit psychology unethically

Understanding these patterns helps designers avoid recreating known problems.

***

## Category 1: Progress Blockers

### Anti-Pattern 1.1: Critical Path Resources

**The Problem:** Making progress-critical elements dependent on depletable/missable resources

**Why it emerges:**

* Designer wants resource scarcity to create tension
* Applies scarcity to wrong resource type
* Doesn't distinguish between "interesting" and "critical" information

**Classic Example: D\&D Investigation**

**What happened:**

* Finding clues requires skill rolls
* Critical clue is gated behind roll
* Players fail roll → miss clue → investigation stalls
* Solution: Kill NPC and search body (violence becomes investigation method)

**Why it fails:**

* Mystery games should be about *interpretation*, not *accumulation* of clues
* Gating clues creates dead stops, not interesting challenges
* Players solve mysteries through violence instead of deduction
* Wrong aesthetic served (Combat, not Discovery)

**Configuration problems:**

* Mechanics (roll to find) vs Context (investigation story) incoherent
* System Function #2 (Information Management) broken
* Character Creation allows non-investigators (wrong character types)

**The underlying issue:**

* Core loop breaks on failure (find clue → interpret → next scene)
* If "find clue" can fail, loop stalls
* No interesting failure state (just "try again" or "stuck")

**Solution: Separate Core vs. Optional Information**

**Gumshoe model:**

* Core clues: Automatic (always find them)
* Optional clues: Cost investigation points (strategic choice)
* Challenge shifts to: "What do clues mean?" not "Can I find clues?"

**Design principle:**

* If resource is necessary for progress, don't make it depletable/missable
* Save scarcity for resources that create *interesting* choices, not *blocking* situations

**Recognition test:**
"If players run out of this resource, can the game continue in an interesting way?"

* If NO → Don't make it depletable
* If YES → Scarcity can work

> **Confidence: ✅ Validated**
>
> D\&D investigation failure is well-documented problem. Gumshoe's solution has proven successful across multiple mystery games (Trail of Cthulhu, Night's Black Agents, etc.). Pattern generalizes: Don't gate critical path behind depletable resources.

**Variations of this anti-pattern:**

* Healing resources so scarce that TPK inevitable
* Required items that can be sold/discarded accidentally
* Story-critical NPCs that can die before revealing information
* Puzzle solutions that require consumable items

### Anti-Pattern 1.2: Death Spiral Resources

**The Problem:** Resources that make losing worse, creating unrecoverable positions

**Why it emerges:**

* Designer wants "consequences for failure"
* Creates feedback loop: lose → weaker → lose more
* No comeback mechanic

**Example: Simple HP Systems Without Recovery**

**What happens:**

* Take damage → less HP
* Less HP → more vulnerable
* More vulnerable → take more damage
* Spiral to death

**When this works:**

* Short timeframes (single combat encounter)
* Intentional attrition (HoMM3 campaign strategy)
* Tension is the aesthetic

**When this fails:**

* Long campaigns where early mistakes compound
* No way to recover except "restart"
* Creates frustration, not challenge

**Solution: Recovery Mechanisms**

**Options:**

1. **Periodic full refresh** (modern D\&D long rest)
2. **Gradual regeneration** (WoW out-of-combat healing)
3. **Comeback mechanics** (Catan robber targets leader)
4. **Separate buffer resource** (Blades stress recovers, harm doesn't but can push through)

**Design principle:**
"If failure makes further failure more likely, provide recovery or comeback mechanics"

**Recognition test:**

* Simulate losing early vs. winning early
* Does early loss make final outcome inevitable?
* If YES → Add comeback mechanics or shorten timeframe

> **Note:** Sometimes death spirals are intentional (roguelikes, permadeath games)
>
> The question isn't "is death spiral present?" but "does it serve the aesthetic?"
>
> * Slay the Spire: Death spiral within run (no recovery), but runs are short and start fresh
> * HoMM3: Army losses permanent, but that's the strategic layer
> * Broken: Death spiral in long campaign with no fresh start option

### Anti-Pattern 1.3: Resource Starvation

**The Problem:** Players never have enough resources to engage with core systems

**Why it emerges:**

* Designer wants "meaningful scarcity"
* Makes resources too scarce
* Players can't afford to use interesting mechanics

**Example: Overly Scarce Spell Slots (Early D\&D)**

**What happens:**

* Wizard has 2 spell slots per day
* Combat encounters drain slots quickly
* Wizard saves slots "for when really needed"
* Result: Wizard doesn't cast spells (core class fantasy unused)

**Why it fails:**

* Core mechanic (spellcasting) becomes inaccessible
* Players avoid engaging with interesting systems
* Reduces to "basic attack spam"

**Modern D\&D solution:**

* More spell slots at low levels
* Cantrips (unlimited weak spells)
* Short rest recovery (more frequent refresh)
* Result: Wizards actually cast spells

**Design principle:**
"Players should be able to engage with core mechanics regularly, not hoard them for 'perfect' moment"

**Recognition test:**

* Playtest: Are players using their signature abilities?
* If players consistently save resources and never use them → too scarce
* If every use feels precious and anxious → too scarce
* If players experiment freely → good balance

**Related to psychological effects:**

* Starvation creates hoarding behavior (Part 7: Greed)
* Loss aversion prevents spending
* "Save for boss" syndrome

> **Anti-Pattern Example: Consumable Overload**
>
> **Skyrim potions:**
>
> * Hundreds of potions found
> * Each individually valuable
> * Never clear "use now" moment
> * Result: Beat game with full inventory, never used
>
> **Why it fails:**
>
> * Abundance creates preciousness (each one rare enough to save)
> * No forcing function (never must use)
> * Unclear optimal use case
>
> **Better approach:**
>
> * Make potions very abundant (okay to use freely)
> * OR create clear "use now" signals (boss fight markers)
> * OR make them expire (use it or lose it)

***

## Category 2: Experience Underminders

### Anti-Pattern 2.1: System Selection Error

**The Problem:** Choosing resource system that conflicts with intended aesthetic

**Why it emerges:**

* Designer starts with familiar system (D\&D, etc.)
* Applies it to different aesthetic goal
* Mechanics fight against intended experience

**Major Example: D\&D for Mystery Investigation** (covered in detail in Part 1)

**The mismatch:**

* D\&D optimized for: Tactical combat, power fantasy, dungeon crawling
* Mystery needs: Guaranteed information flow, interpretation challenge
* D\&D mechanics: Roll to find clues (can fail), combat resolution
* Result: Players solve mysteries through violence

**Why this happens:**

* D\&D is familiar/default
* "We'll just use D\&D for everything"
* Don't recognize that different aesthetics need different systems

**Recognition test:**
"What is this game system optimized for? Does that match my aesthetic goal?"

If mismatch → either:

1. Change system (use one designed for your aesthetic)
2. Heavily modify system (but then why not use better base?)
3. Accept mismatch (if minor)

**Solution: Aesthetic-First Design**

1. Define aesthetic goal clearly
2. Research systems that serve that aesthetic
3. Choose/design system that matches
4. Don't force familiar systems into wrong roles

> **Validated Example: Gumshoe for Mysteries**
>
> Designed specifically for investigation aesthetic:
>
> * Core clues automatic (progress guaranteed)
> * Investigation points for optional depth
> * Challenge is interpretation, not accumulation
> * Character creation filtered (all PCs are investigators)
>
> Result: System serves aesthetic correctly

**Other examples:**

* Using combat-focused system for social drama (wrong tools)
* Using rules-light system for tactical challenge (insufficient depth)
* Using narrative system for optimization gameplay (mechanics too loose)

### Anti-Pattern 2.2: Meaningless Accumulation

**The Problem:** Resources that accumulate but don't create interesting decisions

**Why it emerges:**

* "RPGs have XP, so we need XP"
* Adding resources without purpose
* Progression for progression's sake

**Example: Grinding for Levels (Early MMOs)**

**What happens:**

* Kill monsters → get XP
* Get XP → level up
* Level up → kill harder monsters → repeat
* No decision-making, just time investment

**Why it fails:**

* Challenge aesthetic claims to be present
* But "challenge" is just time spent, not skill
* Accumulation is inevitable, not earned
* Reduces to Submission aesthetic (mindless activity)

**When accumulation works:**

* Tied to meaningful choices (skill point allocation)
* Reflects player decisions (Slay the Spire deck composition)
* Creates strategic layer (HoMM3 what to build)

**Design principle:**
"Accumulation should reflect player choices, not just time spent"

**Recognition test:**

* "Could a bot/macro do this?"
* If YES → Meaningless accumulation
* If NO → Meaningful decisions involved

**Related to aesthetics:**

* If Progression aesthetic is goal, accumulation can be the point
* But ensure "what you accumulate" reflects choices
* Not just "you played longer"

### Anti-Pattern 2.3: Resource Complexity Overload

**The Problem:** Too many resource types tracking too many things

**Why it emerges:**

* Each system seems individually reasonable
* Don't consider cumulative cognitive load
* "Depth through complexity" assumption

**Example: WoW Currency Proliferation (Some Expansions)**

**What happened:**

* Valor points, Justice points, Conquest points, Honor points
* Raid tokens, dungeon tokens, world quest tokens
* Multiple reputations with faction-specific currencies
* Crafting materials (dozens of types)
* Result: Overwhelming, confusing, tedious

**Why it fails:**

* Cognitive load exceeds benefit (see separate Cognitive Load document)
* Tracking becomes chore, not gameplay
* Optimization requires spreadsheets
* Casual players lost, hardcore players annoyed

**Modern WoW solution:**

* Consolidated currencies
* Simplified systems
* "How many currencies can players reasonably track?"

**Design principle:**
"Each resource type should justify its cognitive load with meaningful decisions"

**Recognition test:**

* List all resource types
* For each: "What unique decisions does this create?"
* If answers overlap → Consolidate
* If no good answer → Remove

**Guidelines:**

* 3-5 resource types: Manageable for most players
* 6-10: Requires significant attention, better be worth it
* 10+: Overwhelming for most, only for hardcore optimization games

**Related to:**

* Cognitive Load (separate document) - complexity budget
* Fellowship aesthetic - complex systems reduce social interaction time

> **Counter-Example: Catan's 5 Resources**
>
> **Why it works:**
>
> * Only 5 types (brick, lumber, wool, grain, ore)
> * Clear uses (specific building costs)
> * Can hold in head while socializing
> * Trading creates interaction
> * Enough for strategic depth, not so much as to overwhelm

### Anti-Pattern 2.4: Wrong Character Creation Filter

**The Problem:** Character creation allows choices that break intended aesthetic

**Why it emerges:**

* "Player freedom is good"
* Don't recognize some character types don't fit
* Generic system applied to specific aesthetic

**Example: D\&D Mystery - The Barbarian Problem**

**What happens:**

* Mystery game needs investigators (curious, analytical, social)
* D\&D allows barbarian (combat-focused, low mental stats)
* Barbarian player can't engage with investigation
* Either: Player bored, or solves mysteries through violence

**Why it fails:**

* Character creation should filter for aesthetic fit
* Too broad creation → some PCs can't engage with core gameplay
* "Player freedom" undermines experience

**Solution: Constrained Character Creation**

**Gumshoe approach:**

* All PCs must be investigators
* All have investigative abilities
* Can specialize, but all can investigate
* Ensures everyone can engage with mystery

**Blades approach:**

* All playbooks are criminals with relevant skills
* Can't create "farmhand with no criminal ability"
* Ensures everyone fits crew aesthetic

**Design principle:**
"Character creation is an aesthetic filter - constrain it to ensure all characters can engage with core experience"

**Recognition test:**

* "Can a character be created that can't participate in core gameplay?"
* If YES → Tighten constraints
* Character options should be "different ways to engage" not "some can't engage"

**When broad creation works:**

* Open-ended sandbox (any character type viable)
* Party composition handles gaps (specialist roles)
* But even then: All need something to do

***

## Category 3: Engagement Killers

### Anti-Pattern 3.1: Tedious Bookkeeping

**The Problem:** Resource tracking becomes chore rather than gameplay

**Why it emerges:**

* Tracking seemed reasonable in design
* Didn't test actual play experience
* "Realism" or "detail" prioritized over fun

**Example: Strict Encumbrance Tracking**

**What happens:**

* Every item has weight
* Must calculate total weight constantly
* Exceeding limit = penalties
* Players spend time managing inventory, not playing game

**Why it fails:**

* Tracking is tedious (constant math)
* Decisions aren't interesting ("drop rope or rations?")
* Breaks flow of play
* Penalties feel arbitrary

**Modern approach:**

* Abstract inventory (slots, not weight)
* Only track obviously heavy items (treasure, armor)
* Or ignore entirely (not worth tracking)

**Design principle:**
"If tracking a resource isn't creating interesting decisions, don't track it"

**Recognition test:**

* Playtest: Do players groan when tracking this?
* Does tracking interrupt flow of play?
* Are decisions interesting or just busywork?

**Related to:**

* Cognitive Load document (tracking has cost)
* When to automate (computers can track, humans shouldn't)

### Anti-Pattern 3.2: Unintended Grinding

**The Problem:** Optimal play requires repetitive, boring resource farming

**Why it emerges:**

* Resource scarcity + requirement creates grind incentive
* Didn't anticipate players would farm
* Underestimated player optimization

**Example: RPG Consumable Farming**

**What happens:**

* Potions are powerful and useful
* Potions cost gold
* Gold earned from fights
* Optimal play: Farm easy fights for gold → buy potions
* Result: Repetitive grinding

**Why it fails:**

* Interrupts pacing (players leave story to farm)
* Boring (same easy fights repeatedly)
* Feels necessary (optimal play requires it)
* Punishes not grinding (harder without consumables)

**Solutions:**

1. **Make farming impossible/inefficient** (enemies don't respawn, XP diminishes)
2. **Make resources abundant** (don't need to farm)
3. **Cap resources** (can't stockpile beyond limit)
4. **Make farming fun** (if grinding exists, make it engaging)

**Design principle:**
"If optimal play involves repetitive farming, either prevent farming or make it engaging"

**Recognition test:**

* "What's the optimal way to get resource X?"
* If answer is "repeatedly do boring thing" → Problem
* Solutions: Change acquisition, change scarcity, or make activity fun

### Anti-Pattern 3.3: Waiting as Resource Gate

**The Problem:** Real-time waiting required for progress

**Why it emerges:**

* Mobile game monetization (pay to skip wait)
* "Pacing" attempts gone wrong
* Building/crafting time as "realism"

**Example: Mobile Game Timers**

**What happens:**

* Start building → 2 hour wait
* Option: Pay to complete now
* Can't play while waiting
* Result: Either stop playing or pay

**Why it fails (if not monetization intent):**

* Waiting isn't gameplay
* Breaks engagement
* Frustrating, not challenging
* Creates resentment

**When waiting works:**

* Background activity (WoW rested XP while logged out)
* Strategic layer (HoMM3 weekly recruitment creates rhythm)
* Optional (can do other things while waiting)

**Design principle:**
"Waiting should never block play unless it's core strategic element"

**Recognition test:**

* "While waiting, can players do other interesting things?"
* If NO → Remove waiting or make it optional/acceleratable
* Waiting as gate is rarely good design

***

## Category 4: Social Toxicity

### Anti-Pattern 4.1: Resource Hoarding Prevents Cooperation

**The Problem:** Individual benefit from hoarding undermines group play

**Why it emerges:**

* Resources are personal
* No incentive to share
* Competition within co-op

**Example: Loot Drama in MMOs**

**What happens:**

* Party kills boss together
* Loot drops (limited items)
* Competition for loot within group
* Drama: "I deserve it more" "You got last item" "Need before greed?"

**Why it fails:**

* Fellowship aesthetic undermined by competition
* Cooperation to kill boss, competition for rewards
* Creates resentment, argument, toxicity

**Solutions:**

1. **Personal loot** (everyone gets own drops)
2. **Shared currency** (convert drops to tokens everyone gets)
3. **Consensus required** (group decides distribution)
4. **Rotating rights** (take turns getting first pick)

**Design principle:**
"In cooperative games, avoid zero-sum resource competition within group"

**Caveat:** Competitive games (Catan) = zero-sum is intended

### Anti-Pattern 4.2: Required Resource Gating

**The Problem:** Access to content gated by arbitrary resource requirements

**Why it emerges:**

* "Progression" system
* Keep players playing longer
* Create goals to chase

**Example: WoW Gear Score Gatekeeping**

**What happens:**

* Content requires minimum gear score
* Gear score from running content
* But can't run content without gear score
* Catch-22: Need gear to get gear

**Result:**

* Experienced players gatekeep newcomers
* "Link achievement" proving you've done it before
* Social toxicity, elitism
* Excludes new/returning players

**Solutions:**

1. **Multiple entry paths** (gear available from different sources)
2. **Catchup mechanics** (new players can reach baseline quickly)
3. **Mentorship incentives** (reward helping new players)
4. **Remove gates** (skill-based, not gear-based requirements)

**Design principle:**
"Required resources should be accessible without creating gatekeeping"

### Anti-Pattern 4.3: Competitive Resource Scarcity Creates Toxicity

**The Problem:** Scarce shared resources create conflict in co-op games

**Why it emerges:**

* Limited resources in group content
* Competition for scarce goods
* "Tragedy of the commons"

**Example: Limited Resource Nodes**

**What happens:**

* Mining node appears
* Multiple players need it
* First to click gets it
* Creates: Rushing, frustration, resentment

**Solutions:**

1. **Personal instances** (everyone gets own node)
2. **Sharing mechanics** (multiple players can use same node)
3. **Abundant resources** (enough for everyone)
4. **Different resources** (players want different things)

**Design principle:**
"In cooperative contexts, avoid resource competition unless conflict is intended aesthetic"

***

## Category 5: Manipulative Design

### Anti-Pattern 5.1: Artificial FOMO for Retention

**The Problem:** Creating anxiety through time-limited content to drive engagement metrics

**Why it emerges:**

* Business goals (daily active users, retention)
* Psychological exploitation
* "Games as service" model

**Example: Daily Quest Treadmills**

**What happens:**

* Rewards only available daily
* Miss a day → fall behind
* Creates obligation ("must log in")
* Game feels like job

**Why it's problematic:**

* Engagement through anxiety, not enjoyment
* Manipulative (exploits FOMO psychology)
* Player wellbeing vs. business metrics
* Ethical concerns

**When time-gating might be justified:**

* Scheduled social events (raid nights = coordination)
* Seasonal freshness (new content periodically)
* Progression pacing (prevent rushing through)

**But:**

* Don't make rewards exclusive/missable
* Don't create daily obligation
* Don't punish taking breaks

**Design principle:**
"Time-limited content should create excitement, not obligation"

**Recognition test:**

* "Does missing this create anxiety or disappointment?"
* Anxiety → Manipulative
* Disappointment but "oh well" → Acceptable

**Better alternatives:**

* Make events recurring (comes back later)
* Remove exclusive rewards (just for fun, not advancement)
* Accumulate at own pace (no "use it or lose it")

> **Confidence: ⚠️ Controversial**
>
> This anti-pattern is commercially successful (drives metrics) but ethically questionable. Some designers argue time-gating is necessary for live games. Others see it as manipulation.
>
> From aesthetic perspective: Time-gating rarely serves player experience, usually serves business goals.

### Anti-Pattern 5.2: Pay-to-Skip Resource Scarcity

**The Problem:** Creating artificial scarcity to sell solutions

**Why it emerges:**

* Free-to-play monetization
* "Friction then relief" model
* Business model built on frustration

**Example: Energy Systems in Mobile Games**

**What happens:**

* Limited energy to play
* Energy depletes with actions
* Must wait hours to refill
* Or: Pay to refill immediately

**Why it's problematic:**

* Scarcity is artificial (creates problem to sell solution)
* Optimal experience is paid experience
* Free experience deliberately bad
* Manipulative design

**When it might be justified:**

* Free game needs monetization somehow
* Optional content, not main game
* Generous free allotment (not aggressive)

**Better alternatives:**

* Cosmetics only (no gameplay advantage)
* Expansions (pay once, get content)
* Subscription (steady cost, no tricks)
* Generous free tier (no frustration)

**Design principle:**
"If monetization creates bad free experience, reconsider model"

### Anti-Pattern 5.3: Gambling Mechanics Disguised as Resources

**The Problem:** Random rewards with real-money purchase options

**Why it emerges:**

* "Loot box" monetization
* Exploits gambling psychology
* Regulatory gray area

**Example: Randomized Loot Boxes**

**What happens:**

* Premium currency purchased with real money
* Spent on random loot boxes
* Might get rare item, might not
* Creates gambling loop

**Why it's problematic:**

* Exploits addiction psychology
* Especially harmful to vulnerable (children, gambling addiction)
* Predatory monetization
* Increasingly regulated/banned

**Ethical considerations:**

* Transparency (show odds?)
* Age restrictions
* Spending caps
* "Pity timer" (guaranteed reward after X tries)

**Better alternatives:**

* Direct purchase (buy what you want)
* Earned through play (not purchasable)
* Cosmetic only (not gameplay power)

**Design principle:**
"Random monetized rewards should be avoided or heavily regulated"

> **Note:** This is moving beyond aesthetic design into ethics
>
> From pure design perspective: Random rewards can be fun (Slay the Spire relic drops)
>
> Problem is when combined with real money and exploitative psychology
>
> Many jurisdictions now regulating this (Belgium, Netherlands ban loot boxes)

***

## Recognition Patterns Across Anti-Patterns

### Common Threads

**1. Aesthetic Misalignment**

* Many anti-patterns come from mechanics not serving aesthetic
* Solution: Always ask "Does this serve the intended experience?"

**2. Psychological Exploitation**

* Some anti-patterns exploit psychology in harmful ways
* Solution: Design for wellbeing, not just engagement metrics

**3. Accumulated Complexity**

* Individual systems seem fine, together overwhelming
* Solution: Consider cumulative cognitive load

**4. Optimization Over Experience**

* Designer optimizes for business/balance, not player experience
* Solution: Prioritize experience, optimize within that constraint

### Diagnostic Questions

**For any resource system, ask:**

1. **Progress:** "Can this resource block progress? If so, is that interesting?"
2. **Aesthetic:** "Does this resource serve the intended aesthetic?"
3. **Engagement:** "Is tracking/managing this fun or tedious?"
4. **Social:** "Does this create toxicity in multiplayer contexts?"
5. **Ethics:** "Does this manipulate players in harmful ways?"

**If any answer is problematic → redesign or remove**

***

## Solutions Summary

### When to Remove Resources

* Tracking is tedious (not interesting decisions)
* Creates blocking (no interesting failure state)
* Serves no aesthetic purpose (just tradition)
* Creates social toxicity (in co-op contexts)

### When to Modify Resources

* Serves aesthetic but implementation flawed
* Scarcity wrong level (too much/little)
* Recovery pattern wrong (too fast/slow)
* Ownership wrong (personal vs. shared)

### When to Embrace "Problems"

* Death spirals in short timeframes (roguelikes)
* Competitive scarcity in competitive games (zero-sum intended)
* Accumulation as goal (collection aesthetic)
* Time pressure as challenge (real-time strategy)

**The key:** Intentional design aligned with aesthetic goals
