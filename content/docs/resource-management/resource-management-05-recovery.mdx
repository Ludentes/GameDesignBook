# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Document 5: Recovery Patterns

***

## Why Recovery Matters

How resources replenish is as important as how they're spent. Recovery patterns shape:

* **Play rhythm:** Fast vs. slow cycles
* **Risk tolerance:** Conservative vs. aggressive play
* **Strategic timeframe:** Tactical vs. strategic thinking
* **Emotional experience:** Forgiving vs. punishing

**Core insight:** Same resource with different recovery creates completely different games.

***

## High-Level Principle: Recovery Speed Shapes Risk Tolerance

✅ **Validated across all analyzed games**

**Principle:** The faster a resource recovers, the more aggressively players will spend it. Slow or no recovery creates conservative play. Recovery rate is a primary tool for tuning player psychology.

**The spectrum:**

* **Instant recovery:** Extremely aggressive play (no cost to mistakes)
* **Fast recovery:** Aggressive play (safe to experiment)
* **Moderate recovery:** Balanced play (must plan ahead somewhat)
* **Slow recovery:** Conservative play (every loss hurts)
* **No recovery:** Extreme caution (permanent consequences)

**Examples:**

* Modern WoW (fast HP recovery) → Players dive into combat freely
* Old D\&D (slow HP recovery) → Players retreat after every fight
* HoMM3 (no army recovery) → Players avoid unfavorable battles entirely

***

## The Five Recovery Patterns

### Pattern 1: Instant/Automatic Recovery

**Definition:** Resource fully restores immediately or continuously without player action.

**Examples:**

* Modern FPS shield (regenerates when not taking damage)
* WoW HP (regenerates out of combat)
* Mobile game energy (refills over real time)

#### Characteristics

**Speed:** Seconds to minutes
**Player action:** None required (automatic)
**Strategic impact:** Minimal (resource always available)

#### What It Creates

**Aggressive play:**

* No penalty for taking risks
* Encourages experimentation
* Fast-paced gameplay

**Reduced strategic depth:**

* No resource management between encounters
* Each encounter independent
* No attrition pressure

**Forgiveness:**

* Mistakes don't compound
* Can recover from errors quickly
* Accessible to less skilled players

#### When to Use

✓ **Good for:**

* High-tempo gameplay (maintain pace)
* Accessibility (forgiving)
* Submission aesthetic (no stress)
* When resource management ISN'T the challenge

✗ **Poor for:**

* Strategic depth (no planning needed)
* High stakes (no lasting consequences)
* Attrition gameplay (no wearing down over time)

#### Design Considerations

**Q: How fast should recovery be?**

* Too fast: No tension even during encounter
* Too slow: Becomes "moderate recovery" pattern
* Sweet spot: Fast enough to reset between challenges, slow enough to matter during them

**Q: Should it be pure time or require safety?**

* Pure time: Recovers while fighting (HP regen in some games)
* Requires safety: Must disengage to recover (most FPS shields)
* Trade-off: Passive vs. tactical consideration

**Example - Modern FPS Shields:**

* Depletes when hit
* Regenerates after few seconds without damage
* **Creates:** Risk/reward in staying engaged vs. taking cover
* **Works because:** Tactical decision (when to retreat) within fast-paced gameplay

***

### Pattern 2: Fast Recovery (Per-Encounter)

**Definition:** Resource depletes during encounter, fully restores after relatively quickly.

**Examples:**

* D\&D 5e short rest (1 hour, restores some abilities)
* Slay the Spire (full HP between combats... wait, no! HP persists)
* Fighting game round (health resets per round)
* Blades stress (recovers between scores/sessions)

#### Characteristics

**Speed:** Minutes to hours (game time) or per-session (real time)
**Player action:** May require rest/downtime action
**Strategic impact:** Tactical (within encounter) but not strategic (between encounters)

#### What It Creates

**Episodic play:**

* Each encounter relatively independent
* Can go hard each time
* Resets prevent death spirals

**Tactical resource management:**

* Must manage DURING encounter
* But starts fresh next time
* Optimization per-encounter, not across

**Aggressive-but-careful:**

* Can take risks (will recover)
* But must finish encounter successfully
* Push hard, but not recklessly

#### When to Use

✓ **Good for:**

* Episodic structure (TV show-like sessions)
* Tactical challenge without strategic attrition
* Prevents frustration from cascading failures
* Fellowship (groups can attempt challenges without long recovery)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Strategic resource management (no long-term planning)
* Consequence-heavy narratives (nothing persists)
* Attrition-based gameplay (no wearing down)

#### Design Considerations

**Q: What counts as "per-encounter"?**

* Per combat (each fight resets)
* Per scene (narrative beat)
* Per session (real-world time)
* Per mission/score (game structure)

**Example - Blades Stress:**

* Depletes during score (job/heist)
* Recovers between scores
* **Creates:** Can push hard during job (will recover)
* **But:** Trauma accumulates if you max out (long-term consequence)
* **Works because:** Fast recovery enables aggressive play, trauma provides long-term arc

***

### Pattern 3: Moderate Recovery (Per-Rest/Checkpoint)

**Definition:** Resource depletes over multiple encounters, requires significant investment to restore.

**Examples:**

* D\&D long rest (8 hours, restores most resources)
* Darkest Dungeon stress (requires town visit, costs money)
* Checkpoint-based games (save point recovers resources)
* Campfire in Slay the Spire (limited per act, must choose rest vs. upgrade)

#### Characteristics

**Speed:** Hours to days (game time), or requires returning to safe location
**Player action:** Requires commitment (time, location, or resource cost)
**Strategic impact:** High (must plan when to recover)

#### What It Creates

**Strategic resource management:**

* Must plan across multiple encounters
* "How far can I push before resting?"
* Attrition over time

**Risk/reward decisions:**

* Push one more encounter?
* Or play it safe and rest?
* Uncertainty creates tension

**Pacing rhythm:**

* Periods of depletion (tension builds)
* Periods of recovery (release)
* Natural gameplay cadence

#### When to Use

✓ **Good for:**

* Strategic depth (planning across encounters)
* Tension/Challenge aesthetic (stakes persist)
* Campaign structure (long-form play)
* Creating pacing rhythm (push-recover-push)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Accessibility (punishing for mistakes)
* Fast-paced gameplay (recovery slows pace)
* Fellowship (if recovery is lengthy downtime)

#### Design Considerations

**Q: How costly should recovery be?**

* Free but time-consuming: Opportunity cost is time
* Costly but fast: Trade resources for recovery
* Both: Significant commitment
* Trade-off: Accessibility vs. strategic depth

**Q: How much should recover?**

* Full recovery: Clean slate
* Partial recovery: Attrition continues
* Variable: Player choice (Slay the Spire campfire)

**Example - Slay the Spire Campfires:**

* Limited campfires per act (scarcity)
* Must choose: Rest (heal \~30% HP) OR Upgrade card (permanent power)
* **Creates:** "Do I need healing or power more?" strategic choice
* **Works because:** Scarcity makes each choice meaningful, both options valuable

***

### Pattern 4: Slow Recovery (Per-Session/Long-Term)

**Definition:** Resource depletes and takes substantial time/investment to restore, or may not fully restore.

**Examples:**

* Old-school D\&D HP (healing rare, rests don't fully restore)
* Blades Harm (requires downtime actions, costs coin/time)
* Darkest Dungeon afflictions (may be permanent)
* Slay the Spire HP (limited healing, carries through entire run)

#### Characteristics

**Speed:** Sessions to weeks (game time), or significant resource investment
**Player action:** Requires major commitment or multiple recovery steps
**Strategic impact:** Extreme (shapes entire campaign/run strategy)

#### What It Creates

**Extreme caution:**

* Every loss is significant
* Avoid unfavorable engagements
* Play defensively

**Long-term consequences:**

* Damage accumulates across sessions
* Creates character history/story
* "Wounded veteran" narrative

**Death spiral risk:**

* Early mistakes compound
* Can become unwinnable
* May require restart

**High stakes:**

* Decisions matter intensely
* Memorable moments (close calls)
* Emotional investment

#### When to Use

✓ **Good for:**

* High-stakes gameplay (every decision matters)
* Narrative consequences (wounds tell story)
* Attrition as core mechanic
* Tension/Challenge aesthetic

✗ **Poor for:**

* Accessibility (very punishing)
* Experimentation (can't afford mistakes)
* Fast-paced play (slows everything down)
* Submission aesthetic (too stressful)

#### Design Considerations

**Q: Can death spirals be prevented?**

* Partial recovery options (expensive but available)
* Comeback mechanics (injured characters get bonuses)
* Safety valves (can retreat/restart)
* Trade-off: Maintaining stakes vs. preventing frustration

**Q: Does slow recovery serve aesthetic?**

* If Narrative: Slow recovery creates character arc (wounded veteran)
* If Challenge: Slow recovery creates long-term strategy
* If neither: Might just be frustrating

**Example - Blades Harm:**

* Harm is specific (Broken Leg, Exhausted, etc.)
* Heals slowly (downtime action) or costs coin
* Can push through harm (take penalty, Devil's Bargain)
* **Creates:** Grizzled criminals accumulating injuries over campaign
* **Works because:** Serves narrative aesthetic (character arc through mechanics)

***

### Pattern 5: No Recovery (Permanent Loss)

**Definition:** Resource is lost forever, cannot be restored.

**Examples:**

* HoMM3 army units (dead soldiers stay dead)
* Character death in permadeath games (XCOM, roguelikes)
* Irreversible story choices
* Consumable items used up

#### Characteristics

**Speed:** Never recovers
**Player action:** None (irreversible)
**Strategic impact:** Maximum (every loss permanent)

#### What It Creates

**Maximum caution:**

* Avoid all unnecessary risks
* Careful planning essential
* Conservative play dominant strategy

**Extreme stakes:**

* Every decision matters intensely
* Losses are memorable and emotional
* Attachment to resources/characters

**Potential for total failure:**

* Can run out completely
* May become unwinnable
* Restart might be only option

**Meaningful victories:**

* Success despite permanent stakes
* Relief and triumph when winning
* Stories of near-disasters

#### When to Use

✓ **Good for:**

* Maximum tension (highest stakes)
* Strategic depth (must plan for permanent loss)
* Emotional investment (attachment to resources)
* Roguelikes (permanent loss but fresh starts)

✗ **Poor for:**

* Accessibility (extremely punishing)
* Experimentation (can't afford to try things)
* Players who dislike harsh consequences
* Most Fellowship contexts (too stressful for social play)

#### Design Considerations

**Q: How to prevent total failure?**

* **Option 1:** Ensure enough resources exist (scarcity but not depletion)
* **Option 2:** Provide alternative paths (can recover from loss)
* **Option 3:** Accept failure as possibility (roguelike approach)
* **Option 4:** Soft reset mechanics (can rebuild, but costly)

**Q: Does permanent loss serve aesthetic?**

* If Tension/Challenge: Yes (creates maximum stakes)
* If Narrative: Maybe (creates story but might frustrate)
* If anything else: Probably not

**Example - HoMM3 Army Units:**

* Dead units gone forever
* Must recruit new ones (weekly)
* **Creates:** Every battle is decision (is winning worth the losses?)
* **Works because:** Strategic game where calculating costs is the point
* **Caution:** Can lead to savescumming (reload to avoid bad battles)

> **Note on Permadeath:** Different from other permanent losses because it ends character entirely. Creates extreme stakes but also extreme frustration if players lose beloved characters to random chance. Works best in roguelikes where starting over is expected.

***

## Hybrid Recovery Patterns

Many games use multiple recovery patterns for different resources. This creates strategic depth through different time scales.

### Pattern: Fast + Slow (Blades Model)

**Example - Blades in the Dark:**

* **Stress:** Fast recovery (between scores)
* **Harm:** Slow recovery (downtime + coin)
* **Trauma:** No recovery (permanent)

**What it creates:**

* **Three time scales:**
  * Tactical (per-score stress management)
  * Strategic (cross-score harm management)
  * Campaign (character arc through trauma)
* **Different strategic layers without overwhelming complexity**

✅ **Validated:** Multiple timescale resources create richer experience

**When to use:** Want depth without overwhelming players

### Pattern: Partial Fast + Full Slow

**Example - D\&D 5e:**

* **Short rest (fast):** Restores some HP (hit dice), some abilities
* **Long rest (slow):** Restores all HP, all abilities, all hit dice

**What it creates:**

* **Tactical push-recover:** Short rest between encounters
* **Strategic planning:** When to take long rest
* **Pacing:** Multiple small cycles within larger cycle

**When to use:** Want both tactical and strategic resource management

### Pattern: Automatic Fast + Manual Slow

**Example - Many RPGs:**

* **HP:** Regenerates out of combat (automatic fast)
* **Abilities:** Require rest/recharge (manual slow)

**What it creates:**

* **Survival automatic:** Don't die between fights
* **Power management strategic:** Plan ability use
* **Focus on interesting decisions:** Not HP micromanagement

**When to use:** Want to remove tedious healing while keeping resource decisions interesting

***

## Recovery and Risk Tolerance

### Mathematical Relationship

**Formula (intuitive, not precise):**

```
Risk Tolerance = (Recovery Speed × Resource Abundance) / (Consequence Severity)
```

**Fast recovery + abundant + low consequence = High risk tolerance**
**Slow recovery + scarce + high consequence = Low risk tolerance**

### Examples

**High Risk Tolerance:**

* Modern FPS (instant shield recovery, respawn at checkpoint)
* Players rush into combat, experiment freely
* Mistakes don't compound

**Moderate Risk Tolerance:**

* D\&D 5e (moderate HP recovery, death unlikely but possible)
* Players take calculated risks
* Can recover from mistakes

**Low Risk Tolerance:**

* XCOM Ironman (permadeath, no recovery)
* Players move cautiously, plan extensively
* Single mistake can cascade

**Extreme Risk Aversion:**

* HoMM3 early game (weak army, no recovery, death possible)
* Players avoid combat unless certain to win
* Loss is catastrophic

### Design Implications

**Want aggressive play?**

* Fast recovery
* Abundant resources
* Low consequence for mistakes

**Want careful play?**

* Slow recovery
* Scarce resources
* High consequence for mistakes

**Want strategic depth?**

* Mix of recovery speeds
* Different resources, different rates
* Multiple timescales

## Common Patterns and What They Create

### Pattern: Instant Recovery with Cooldown

**How it works:** Resource immediately available but limited uses

**Example:** Fighting game special moves (instant, but cooldown between uses)

**Creates:** Tactical timing (when to use), not conservation (will be back)

### Pattern: Fast Recovery with Cap

**How it works:** Recovers quickly but can't exceed maximum

**Example:** Mobile game energy (regenerates over time, caps at 5)

**Creates:** "Spend it before capping" incentive, regular engagement

### Pattern: Slow Recovery with Acceleration

**How it works:** Heals slowly, but can invest to speed up

**Example:** Idle games, some MMOs

**Creates:** "Wait or pay" choice, monetization opportunity

### Pattern: Variable Recovery (Player Choice)

**How it works:** Player chooses how much to recover, at a cost

**Example:** Slay the Spire campfire (how much HP vs. how many upgrades)

**Creates:** Strategic trade-offs, player agency

***

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Recovery Makes Resource Meaningless

> **Anti-Pattern: Too-Fast Recovery**
> Resource recovers so quickly it might as well not exist.

**Example:** Mana that fully regenerates in 10 seconds

* Nominal resource
* Practically infinite
* Not actually managing anything

**Fix:** Either slow recovery or remove resource entirely

### Mistake 2: No Recovery Makes Progress Impossible

> **Anti-Pattern: Death Spiral with No Escape**
> Slow/no recovery leads to unwinnable state.

**Example:** Permanent resource loss with no replenishment

* Early mistakes compound
* Becomes unwinnable
* Must restart

**Fix:** Provide recovery option (expensive but available) or accept restart-focused design (roguelike)

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Recovery Creates Confusion

> **Anti-Pattern: Similar Resources, Different Recovery**
> Resources that seem similar recover differently without clear reason.

**Example:** HP and Stamina both deplete similarly but recover at wildly different rates

* Unclear why difference exists
* Players confused about management
* Feels arbitrary

**Fix:** Either make recovery consistent or differentiate resources clearly (different types, different purposes)

### Mistake 4: Recovery Negates Consequences

> **Anti-Pattern: Narrative Stakes with Mechanical Reset**
> Story suggests serious consequences but mechanics trivialize them.

**Example:** "Barely survived" but HP fully restored moments later

* Narrative and mechanics disconnect
* Stakes feel hollow
* Undermines drama

**Fix:** Match recovery speed to narrative stakes (serious wounds = slow recovery)

***

## Summary: Designing Recovery Patterns

**The five primary patterns:**

1. **Instant/Automatic:** No management needed (fast-paced, forgiving)
2. **Fast (Per-Encounter):** Episodic play (tactical but not strategic)
3. **Moderate (Per-Rest):** Strategic planning (attrition over time)
4. **Slow (Long-Term):** High stakes (every loss matters)
5. **None (Permanent):** Maximum stakes (irreversible consequences)

**Recovery shapes:**

* Risk tolerance (fast = aggressive, slow = cautious)
* Strategic timeframe (fast = tactical, slow = strategic)
* Emotional stakes (fast = forgiving, slow = intense)
* Play rhythm (recovery cycles = pacing)

**Choose recovery based on:**

* Aesthetic goals (Challenge? Tension? Accessibility?)
* Desired risk tolerance (aggressive or cautious?)
* Strategic depth (tactical or strategic?)
* Emotional experience (forgiving or punishing?)

**Hybrid patterns create:**

* Multiple timescales (tactical + strategic)
* Strategic depth without overwhelming
* Varied pacing

**Avoid:**

* Too-fast recovery (meaningless resource)
* No-escape death spirals (frustration)
* Inconsistent recovery (confusion)
* Mechanics negating narrative stakes

**The fundamental test:** "Does this recovery pattern create the play style and emotional experience I want?"
