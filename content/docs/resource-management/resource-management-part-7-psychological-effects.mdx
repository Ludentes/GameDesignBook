# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Part 7: Psychological Effects of Resource Design

***

## Overview

Resource systems don't just create mechanical challenges - they create psychological states that shape player experience. How players *feel* about having, accumulating, and spending resources is as important as the mechanical systems themselves.

This section examines three key psychological phenomena that emerge from resource design:

1. **Possession** - What does "having" create experientially?
2. **Greed** - Why do players accumulate beyond need?
3. **FOMO** (Fear of Missing Out) - How does resource design create anxiety?

These aren't problems to solve universally - they're tools that serve different aesthetic goals. Understanding them helps designers create intended experiences rather than accidental ones.

***

## 1. Possession: The Experience of Having

### What Possession Creates Psychologically

"Having" resources creates multiple distinct experiential states:

#### 1.1 Security/Safety

**Experience:** "I have potions, therefore I can survive mistakes"

**What it creates:**

* Psychological buffer against failure
* Confidence to take risks
* Comfort in preparation

**Examples:**

* **Slay the Spire potions:** Full potion slots = "I can handle the next fight"
* **HoMM3 gold reserves:** Stockpiled gold = "I can recover from setback"
* **Blades in the Dark stress capacity:** Low stress = "I can push myself if needed"

**Serves aesthetics:**

* Challenge (need buffer to attempt difficult content)
* Discovery (safe to explore unknown)

**Design consideration:** Too much security eliminates tension. Too little creates paralysis.

#### 1.2 Identity/Expression

**Experience:** "I have this unique item, this is who I am"

**What it creates:**

* Self-definition through possessions
* Collection as personal narrative
* Gear as character identity

**Examples:**

* **WoW rare mounts:** "I'm the player who has the Ashes of Al'ar"
* **Slay the Spire relics:** "This is my poison deck build"
* **Blades trauma marks:** "My character has 'Cold' trauma from the ghost heist"

**Serves aesthetics:**

* Expression (possessions reflect choices)
* Fantasy (items = who you are in fiction)
* Progression (collection shows journey)

**Design consideration:** Make possessions distinctive and memorable, not just +1 stat increases.

#### 1.3 Potential/Options

**Experience:** "I have these tools, I can handle situations"

**What it creates:**

* Preparedness fantasy
* Strategic flexibility
* Problem-solving capacity

**Examples:**

* **Blades in the Dark Load:** "I'm carrying heavy load, I prepared for anything"
* **Slay the Spire diverse deck:** "I have answers to different threats"
* **Catan varied resources:** "I can build whatever I need"

**Serves aesthetics:**

* Challenge (options enable strategy)
* Mastery (recognizing when to use what)
* Fantasy (competent protagonist)

**Design consideration:** Too many options → analysis paralysis. Too few → lack of agency.

#### 1.4 Status/Achievement

**Experience:** "I earned this rare item, I'm accomplished"

**What it creates:**

* Visible wealth as social signal
* Achievement markers
* Prestige through possession

**Examples:**

* **WoW legendary weapons:** Social recognition of accomplishment
* **HoMM3 powerful artifacts:** "I conquered the map and got this"
* **Blades crew upgrades:** "We're now a Tier 3 crew"

**Serves aesthetics:**

* Challenge (proof of overcoming difficulty)
* Progression (visible advancement)
* Fellowship (status within community)

**Design consideration:** Status through possession can create unhealthy social dynamics (gatekeeping, elitism).

#### 1.5 Power Fantasy

**Experience:** "I have everything, I'm unstoppable"

**What it creates:**

* Apotheosis through accumulation
* Overwhelming capability
* "God mode" satisfaction

**Examples:**

* **Late-game Slay the Spire:** Synergistic deck + relics = unstoppable
* **HoMM3 maxed hero:** Level 30+ hero with best artifacts
* **WoW fully geared character:** Maximum item level

**Serves aesthetics:**

* Challenge (earned through difficulty)
* Progression (culmination of growth)
* Submission (relaxing power trip)

**Design consideration:** Can trivialize challenge if not balanced. Timing matters - often best at end of content.

### Design Principle: Match Possession Experience to Aesthetic

**High-level principle:**
"Different aesthetics require different 'having' experiences - design what possession *means* based on intended player experience"

**Guidelines:**

**For Challenge aesthetic:**

* Possession = preparedness, strategic options
* Example: Slay the Spire relics enable different strategies

**For Expression aesthetic:**

* Possession = identity, uniqueness
* Example: Character builds show player creativity

**For Fellowship aesthetic:**

* Possession = shared resources, group identity
* Example: Blades crew upgrades belong to everyone

**For Progression aesthetic:**

* Possession = achievement markers, visible growth
* Example: WoW gear shows character advancement

**For Power Fantasy aesthetic:**

* Possession = overwhelming capability
* Example: Late-game god builds

> **Note:** Same resource can create different possession experiences based on context
>
> * Gold in HoMM3 = security (can recover from losses)
> * Gold in Catan = potential (can buy what I need)
> * Gold in WoW = status (can afford expensive items)

***

## 2. Greed: Accumulation Beyond Need

### What Is Greed in Game Design?

**Definition:** The desire to accumulate resources beyond immediate need, often to the point of never using them.

**Manifestations:**

* Hoarding consumables ("save potions for boss, never use them")
* Completionism ("must collect everything")
* Optimal play over experiential play ("this is the best build")
* Analysis paralysis ("can't spend until I know perfect use")

### Why Does Greed Emerge?

#### 2.1 Loss Aversion

**Psychological principle:** Loss hurts more than equivalent gain feels good

**In games:**

* "If I use this potion now and don't need it later, I'll regret it"
* Fear of making "wrong" choice
* Hoarding as insurance against uncertainty

**Example: Slay the Spire potions**

* Common pattern: Never use potions, lose with full slots
* Why: "What if I need them more later?"
* Result: Resource goes unused entire run

**Design implications:**

* Players need explicit permission/encouragement to spend
* Irreversible spending creates anxiety
* Uncertainty about future needs triggers hoarding

#### 2.2 Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Psychological principle:** Past investment influences present decisions

**In games:**

* "I've been building toward this strategy, can't change now"
* "I already spent resources on X, must commit"
* Continuing suboptimal path due to prior investment

**Example: Slay the Spire deck building**

* Took poison cards early
* Keep taking poison even when not optimal
* "Already committed to poison strategy"

**Design implications:**

* Allow strategy pivots (card removal in Slay the Spire)
* Make sunk costs visible so players recognize trap
* Or: Embrace commitment (no respec = meaningful choices)

#### 2.3 Optimization Mindset

**Psychological principle:** Treating game as puzzle with "correct" solution

**In games:**

* Finding "best" build and refusing alternatives
* Optimizing away experiential variation
* "Solving" the game rather than playing it

**Example: WoW class specs**

* Simulations determine optimal builds
* Players copy best builds rather than experimenting
* Reduces Expression aesthetic to Challenge aesthetic

**Design implications:**

* Multiple viable strategies (prevent single dominant strategy)
* Opaque optimization (can't perfectly calculate optimal)
* Rewards for experimentation (Slay the Spire encourages weird builds)

#### 2.4 Collection as Goal

**Psychological principle:** Accumulation itself is satisfying

**In games:**

* Pokémon "gotta catch 'em all"
* Completing collections (achievements, mounts, items)
* Acquisition more satisfying than use

**Example: WoW mount collecting**

* Players farm rare mounts (0.01% drop rates)
* Mount itself is goal, not using it
* Collection number is achievement

**Design implications:**

* This can be INTENDED (collection as aesthetic)
* But conflicts if resources are meant to be spent
* Clarify: Is collecting the point or the means?

### When Is Greed Good vs. Bad?

Greed isn't inherently a problem - it depends on aesthetic goals.

#### Greed Serves the Aesthetic

**When accumulation IS the point:**

**Power Fantasy aesthetic:**

* Goal: Become overwhelmingly powerful
* Accumulation = success
* Example: Late-game Slay the Spire - hoarding relics makes you godlike

**Collection aesthetic:**

* Goal: Complete the collection
* Accumulation = achievement
* Example: Pokémon, WoW mount collecting

**Progression aesthetic:**

* Goal: Visible growth over time
* Accumulation = character development
* Example: HoMM3 hero leveling, artifact collection

**Design principle:** If aesthetic is accumulation-focused, enable and reward hoarding.

#### Greed Harms the Aesthetic

**When spending creates the experience:**

**Challenge aesthetic (strategic resource management):**

* Goal: Make difficult choices under scarcity
* Hoarding = avoiding choices
* Example: Never using Slay the Spire potions removes strategic decisions

**Narrative aesthetic:**

* Goal: Drama, consequences, flow
* Hoarding = stopping to optimize, breaking fiction
* Example: Stopping mid-story to farm resources

**Fellowship aesthetic:**

* Goal: Social interaction
* Hoarding = preventing trade/cooperation
* Example: Catan if players could safely hoard (hand limit prevents this)

**Design principle:** If aesthetic requires spending, create mechanisms that encourage/force it.

### Design Techniques: Managing Greed

#### Technique 1: Use-It-Or-Lose-It Pressure

**Mechanism:** Resources expire, reset, or become vulnerable

**Examples:**

* **Catan hand limit:** 8+ cards on 7-roll = lose half
* **Blades stress/trauma:** Can't hoard stress forever (trauma at 4)
* **WoW weekly caps:** Resources reset weekly, can't stockpile infinitely

**What it creates:**

* Forced circulation of resources
* "Spend before it's wasted" motivation
* Removes hoarding as dominant strategy

**Serves:** Challenge, Fellowship (keeps game flowing)

#### Technique 2: Increasing Marginal Cost

**Mechanism:** Hoarding becomes increasingly expensive or difficult

**Examples:**

* **Inventory limits:** Can't carry infinite items (space cost)
* **Storage costs:** Gold required to maintain stockpiles
* **Opportunity costs:** Hoarding prevents using slots for better things

**What it creates:**

* Natural limit on accumulation
* Makes spending relatively attractive
* Still allows some hoarding (for those who value it)

**Serves:** Challenge (creates optimization puzzle)

#### Technique 3: Reward Spending

**Mechanism:** Using resources creates opportunities hoarding doesn't

**Examples:**

* **Slay the Spire potions:** Often find new potions, empty slots enable acquisition
* **Blades flashbacks:** Spend stress retroactively, encourages using capacity
* **HoMM3 artifacts:** Equipped artifacts help win battles → get more resources

**What it creates:**

* Positive feedback loop (spending → gains)
* Overcoming loss aversion (spending pays off)
* Experimentation encouraged

**Serves:** Challenge, Discovery (trying things is rewarded)

#### Technique 4: Opaque Future Needs

**Mechanism:** Can't predict exactly what you'll need later

**Examples:**

* **Slay the Spire encounters:** Don't know what's coming, can't optimize perfectly
* **Catan dice rolls:** Can't predict production, can't plan perfectly
* **Blades consequences:** GM determines problems, can't prepare for everything

**What it creates:**

* Prevents perfect hoarding strategy
* Forces adaptability over optimization
* Makes "good enough now" viable

**Serves:** Challenge (adapting to uncertainty)

> **Anti-Pattern: Consumables That Are Never Optimal to Use**
>
> **The problem:** If consumables are:
>
> * Rare enough to be precious
> * Powerful enough to save "for when I really need them"
> * But never clearly THE moment to use them
>
> **Result:** Players hoard entire game and never use them
>
> **Example:** Skyrim consumable overload
>
> * Hundreds of potions accumulated
> * "Might need them later"
> * Beat game with full inventory
>
> **Solution options:**
>
> 1. Make consumables abundant (okay to use freely)
> 2. Create clear "use now" moments (boss fights)
> 3. Force expiration (use it or lose it)
> 4. Make non-consumable alternatives available (abilities that don't deplete)

### Design Principle: Greed and Aesthetic Alignment

**High-level principle:**
"Greed emerges when accumulation is rewarded more than spending - design resource flow to match whether accumulation or spending should dominate"

**Guidelines:**

**Want accumulation to dominate?**

* Make collection the goal (Pokémon model)
* Reward stockpiling (bigger reserves = safer)
* No forced spending (players can hoard)

**Want spending to dominate?**

* Create use-it-or-lose-it pressure (expiration, caps)
* Reward spending (positive feedback loops)
* Make hoarding costly (inventory limits, vulnerability)

**Want balance?**

* Some resources accumulate (permanent progression)
* Some resources circulate (tactical choices)
* Different resources serve different purposes

***

## 3. FOMO: Fear of Missing Out

### What Is FOMO in Game Design?

**Definition:** Anxiety created by the possibility of missing opportunities, content, or optimal choices.

**Manifestations:**

* "What if I go left and miss something important on the right?"
* "What if I spec wrong and my character is broken?"
* "What if I don't log in daily and fall behind?"
* "What if I use this resource suboptimally?"

### How Resource Design Creates FOMO

#### 3.1 Irreversible Scarcity + Uncertainty

**The formula:** FOMO emerges when:

* Resources are permanently lost if not acquired
* Future needs are uncertain
* No way to go back and get missed resources

**Example: Slay the Spire route choices**

* Choose path A (elite fight) → miss path B (shop)
* Can't go back
* Don't know which was better until after

**But this is GOOD FOMO:**

* Creates meaningful choices
* Replayability (try different paths next run)
* No persistence → failure is cheap

**Why it works:**

* Consequences within run only (next run is fresh start)
* Uncertainty is part of challenge
* Multiple paths are viable

**Serves aesthetic:** Challenge, Discovery

#### 3.2 Time-Limited Resources

**Mechanism:** Content available only during specific windows

**Example: WoW daily/weekly lockouts**

* Daily quests reset at midnight
* Weekly raid lockouts Tuesday mornings
* Seasonal events (2-week windows)

**Creates FOMO:**

* "If I don't log in today, I lose today's progress"
* "If I miss raid night, I don't get loot this week"
* "If I miss seasonal event, I can't get limited items"

**This is PROBLEMATIC FOMO:**

* Creates obligation (must play on schedule)
* Punishes life circumstances (vacation, illness)
* Game feels like job

**Serves aesthetic:** Progression (but at cost of player wellbeing)

> **Note:** Time-gating is often commercial, not aesthetic
>
> * Goal: Increase daily active users (DAU) for metrics
> * Not about creating better experience
> * Creates engagement through anxiety

#### 3.3 Optimal Build Anxiety

**Mechanism:** Fear of making suboptimal character choices

**Example: RPG skill trees**

* Limited skill points
* Can't respec (or expensive to do so)
* "Wrong" choices make character weaker

**Creates FOMO:**

* Analysis paralysis (afraid to commit)
* Following guides instead of experimenting
* Reduces Expression to optimization

**Example: Slay the Spire cards**

* Each card choice matters
* Taking "bad" card weakens deck
* Must carefully curate

**But handled well:**

* Can skip cards (not forced to take)
* Can remove cards later (costs gold but possible)
* Most builds are viable (not one "right" answer)

**Serves aesthetic:** Challenge (meaningful choices)
**Harms aesthetic:** Expression (if players afraid to experiment)

#### 3.4 Competitive FOMO

**Mechanism:** Falling behind other players

**Example: WoW progression races**

* World-first raid clears
* Gear score comparisons
* Arena ratings

**Creates FOMO:**

* "I need to keep up with my guild"
* "Others are getting ahead"
* "I'm falling behind the meta"

**Can be healthy:**

* Competitive aesthetic (racing others is the point)
* Community identity (progression together)
* Clear milestones

**Can be toxic:**

* Burnout from constant progression pressure
* Gatekeeping (too low gear score = excluded)
* Arms race (never enough)

**Serves aesthetic:** Challenge, Fellowship (if managed well)

### When Is FOMO Good vs. Bad?

#### FOMO That Serves Experience

**Creates meaningful choices:**

* Slay the Spire paths: Choose one route, miss others
* Permanent consequences create weight
* Replayability from trying different options
* Failure is cheap (runs are short, can try again)

**Creates urgency/tension:**

* Timed decisions add pressure
* "Must choose now" increases stakes
* Can serve Tension aesthetic

**Creates discovery:**

* "What if I try this path?"
* Exploration encouraged by unknown outcomes
* Serves Discovery aesthetic

**Design pattern:**

* Consequences are serious within bounded context
* Easy to try again (new run, new game, replayability)
* Multiple paths are viable
* Uncertainty is part of challenge

#### FOMO That Harms Experience

**Creates obligation:**

* Daily/weekly requirements
* "Must log in or fall behind"
* Game becomes job

**Creates anxiety:**

* Fear of making wrong choice
* Paralysis instead of play
* Optimization over experimentation

**Creates exclusion:**

* Missing limited-time content
* Can't catch up to others
* Gatekeeping based on timing

**Design pattern:**

* Permanent external consequences (can't try again)
* Real-time pressure (must play on schedule)
* Competitive comparison to others
* Single "correct" path

### Design Techniques: Managing FOMO

#### Technique 1: Bounded Consequences

**Mechanism:** Consequences exist but are contained

**Example: Slay the Spire**

* Choices matter within run
* But each run is fresh start
* Missing something in run 1 doesn't affect run 2

**What it creates:**

* Meaningful decisions (consequences exist)
* Low anxiety (can try again easily)
* Experimentation encouraged

**Serves:** Challenge, Discovery

#### Technique 2: Multiple Viable Paths

**Mechanism:** No single "correct" choice

**Example: Catan building strategies**

* Road strategy vs. city strategy vs. development cards
* All can win
* Choice based on position and preference

**What it creates:**

* Reduces optimal build anxiety
* Enables Expression (play your way)
* Replayability (try different approaches)

**Serves:** Challenge, Expression

#### Technique 3: Respec/Undo Options

**Mechanism:** Choices can be revised

**Example: Modern game skill resets**

* Can change spec for cost (gold, item)
* Experimentation has exit ramp
* Still has cost (not totally free)

**What it creates:**

* Lower anxiety about "wrong" choices
* Encourages trying things
* But cost prevents constant changing

**Serves:** Expression, Discovery

**Trade-off:** Reduces weight of choices

#### Technique 4: Transparency About Consequences

**Mechanism:** Show what you're choosing between

**Example: Slay the Spire map**

* Can see upcoming paths
* Know what you're choosing between
* Still uncertainty (what's in shops, what enemies)

**What it creates:**

* Informed decisions
* Reduces "blind" FOMO
* Still has meaningful choice

**Serves:** Challenge (strategy with information)

#### Technique 5: No Forced Timing

**Mechanism:** Players progress at their own pace

**Example: Single-player games**

* No daily quests
* No weekly lockouts
* No seasonal events
* Play when you want

**What it creates:**

* Zero obligation FOMO
* Respects player time
* Still has in-game choices

**Serves:** Most aesthetics (removes external pressure)

**Trade-off:** Loses scheduled social coordination

> **Anti-Pattern: Artificial Scarcity for Engagement**
>
> **The problem:** Creating FOMO intentionally to drive engagement metrics
>
> **Manifestations:**
>
> * Daily login rewards
> * Limited-time events with exclusive rewards
> * "Battle pass" systems with time pressure
> * Weekly lockouts that reset progress
>
> **Why it's problematic:**
>
> * Engagement through anxiety, not enjoyment
> * Manipulative (exploits psychology)
> * Creates obligation (game as job)
> * Prioritizes metrics over experience
>
> **When it might be justified:**
>
> * Scheduled social events (raid nights) - creates coordination
> * Seasonal content (keeps game fresh) - if not exclusive rewards
> * Commercial necessity (free-to-play sustainability)
>
> **Better alternatives:**
>
> * Make events recurring (miss this time, comes back)
> * Remove exclusive rewards (cosmetics only)
> * Don't reset progress (accumulate at own pace)
> * Focus on enjoyment, not retention metrics

### Design Principle: FOMO and Aesthetic Alignment

**High-level principle:**
"FOMO emerges from irreversible scarcity combined with uncertainty - design whether missing opportunities creates productive tension or unproductive anxiety"

**Guidelines:**

**Productive FOMO (serves experience):**

* Meaningful choices with consequences
* Within bounded context (run, game, match)
* Multiple viable paths
* Easy to try different options later
* Uncertainty is part of challenge

**Unproductive FOMO (harms experience):**

* Obligation through time-gating
* Real-time pressure to log in
* Single optimal path (fear of suboptimal)
* Exclusive content that can't be obtained later
* Competitive pressure to keep up

**Aesthetic alignment:**

**Challenge aesthetic:**

* ✓ Productive FOMO (meaningful choices)
* ✗ Time-limited pressure (unrelated to skill)

**Discovery aesthetic:**

* ✓ Multiple paths to explore
* ✗ Punishing "wrong" exploration

**Expression aesthetic:**

* ✓ Multiple viable builds
* ✗ One optimal spec

**Fellowship aesthetic:**

* ✓ Scheduled events (social coordination)
* ✗ Exclusion for missing events

**Progression aesthetic:**

* ⚠️ Time-gating can work (pacing)
* ✗ But creates obligation if excessive

## 4. Connecting Psychological Effects to Resource Design

### The Feedback Loop

**Resource design → Psychological effects → Player behavior → Aesthetic experience**

**Example: Slay the Spire potions**

1. **Design:** Limited potion slots (3), powerful effects, found regularly
2. **Psychology:** Loss aversion → hoarding ("save for boss")
3. **Behavior:** Never use potions, lose with full slots
4. **Experience:** Aesthetic undermined (strategic resource management goal not achieved)

**Better design:** Make potions abundant, less powerful

* Psychology: Less precious → willing to use
* Behavior: Use potions tactically
* Experience: Strategic resource management achieved

### Design Checklist: Psychological Effects

For each resource in your system, ask:

#### Possession Questions

* What does having this resource *feel* like?
* Is that feeling aligned with intended aesthetic?
* Does accumulation create desired experience?

**Example: HoMM3 armies**

* Possession feels like: Security, power, preparedness
* Aligned with: Challenge aesthetic (battles require strong army)
* Accumulation: Weekly rhythm of building forces
* ✓ Well-aligned

#### Greed Questions

* Will players want to hoard this resource?
* Is hoarding aligned with intended aesthetic?
* If not, what mechanisms discourage it?

**Example: Catan resources**

* Players want to hoard: Yes (security, options)
* Aligned with aesthetic: No (want trading, not stockpiling)
* Mechanism: Hand limit + robber (forces spending)
* ✓ Well-managed

#### FOMO Questions

* Does missing this resource create anxiety?
* Is that anxiety productive (meaningful choice) or unproductive (obligation)?
* Can players recover from "missing" this?

**Example: WoW weekly raid lockouts**

* Missing creates: Yes (fall behind on gear)
* Type of anxiety: Unproductive (obligation to raid on schedule)
* Can recover: Partially (next week, but others progressed)
* ⚠️ Questionable alignment (commercial goal > aesthetic)

### Integration with Aesthetic Goals

**For each aesthetic, consider psychological profile:**

#### Challenge Aesthetic

* **Possession:** Preparedness, strategic options (good)
* **Greed:** Hoarding can undermine decisions (manage carefully)
* **FOMO:** Meaningful choices with consequences (good if bounded)

#### Fellowship Aesthetic

* **Possession:** Shared resources, group identity (good)
* **Greed:** Individual hoarding undermines sharing (prevent)
* **FOMO:** Scheduled events for coordination (good), exclusion for missing (bad)

#### Narrative Aesthetic

* **Possession:** Character identity, story history (good)
* **Greed:** Stopping to optimize breaks fiction (minimize)
* **FOMO:** Irreversible story choices (good), time pressure (bad)

#### Expression Aesthetic

* **Possession:** Unique builds, personal style (good)
* **Greed:** Collection can be the point (depends)
* **FOMO:** Fear of "wrong" build undermines expression (prevent)

#### Progression Aesthetic

* **Possession:** Achievement markers, visible growth (good)
* **Greed:** Accumulation IS the aesthetic (enable)
* **FOMO:** Falling behind others (manage carefully)

## 5. Summary and Key Takeaways

### Core Insights

**1. Psychological effects are not bugs - they're features (or should be)**

* Design creates psychology
* Psychology shapes behavior
* Behavior creates experience
* Align them intentionally

**2. Same psychology serves different aesthetics differently**

* Greed good for: Progression, Collection aesthetics
* Greed bad for: Challenge (if prevents spending), Fellowship (if prevents sharing)
* Designer must decide: Is this effect desired?

**3. Commercial goals and aesthetic goals can conflict**

* Time-gated content creates engagement metrics
* But also creates obligation/anxiety
* Designer must choose: Metrics or experience?

### Design Principles Summary

**On Possession:**

* Match "having" experience to aesthetic goal
* Security serves Challenge, identity serves Expression, status serves Progression

**On Greed:**

* Greed emerges when accumulation > spending in reward
* Encourage spending through: use-it-or-lose-it, reward loops, opacity
* Or embrace accumulation if that's the aesthetic

**On FOMO:**

* Productive FOMO: Meaningful choices, bounded consequences, multiple paths
* Unproductive FOMO: Time pressure, obligation, optimization anxiety
* Design for productive only

### Practical Application

**When designing resource systems:**

1. **Identify intended aesthetic** (what experience do we want?)
2. **Map psychological effects** (what will this design create?)
3. **Check alignment** (does psychology serve aesthetic?)
4. **Adjust mechanisms** (if misaligned, change design)
5. **Playtest specifically for psychology** (do players hoard when they should spend? Feel anxious when they should feel excited?)

### Connection to Other Topics

**This connects to:**

* **Aesthetic goals** (Part 0/Introduction) - psychological effects must serve aesthetics
* **Recovery patterns** (Part 4) - how quickly resources recover affects hoarding behavior
* **Spending mechanics** (Part 5) - how resources are used affects willingness to spend
* **Cognitive load** (separate document) - complexity affects anxiety and decision paralysis
