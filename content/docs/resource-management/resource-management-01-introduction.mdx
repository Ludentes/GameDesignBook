2. Should This Be A Resource?
3. Types of Resources
4. Scarcity and Abundance
5. Recovery Patterns
6. Spending and Agency
7. Ownership: Personal vs Shared
8. Psychological Effects
9. Common Pitfalls
10. Decision Framework & Appendices

## Core Philosophy: Resources as Experiential Tools

### The Wrong Question

Traditional game design often asks: "What resources should our game have?"

This leads to answers like:

* "We need HP, mana, and gold" (copying other RPGs)
* "Let's have energy that regenerates over time" (mobile game convention)
* "Players should manage stamina, hunger, and thirst" (survival game tropes)

These aren't necessarily wrong, but they're starting from mechanics rather than purpose.

### The Right Question

**"What experience do we want players to have, and what resources would create that experience?"**

This reframes resource management from:

* **Copying conventions** → **Designing for purpose**
* **"What's normal?"** → **"What serves our aesthetic?"**
* **Mechanics-first** → **Experience-first**

### Example: Mystery Investigation Games

**Wrong approach:** "Detective games need investigation resources, so let's add Perception skill checks to find clues"

**Right approach:**

1. What experience? "Players solve mysteries through interpretation, not lucky dice rolls"
2. What does that require? "Clues must be findable (not gatable), challenge is what you DO with information"
3. What resources serve this? "Investigation points for OPTIONAL depth clues, core clues automatic"

The resource design (investigation points) emerges from aesthetic goal (interpretation challenge), not from genre convention (skill checks).

## Resources vs. Constraints: A Critical Distinction

Before we can discuss resource management, we must clarify what resources ARE and ARE NOT.

### Resources: In-Game Mechanics

**Resources are in-game entities that:**

* Players manage and make decisions about
* Can be tracked by the game system
* Have explicit mechanics for acquisition and spending
* Create strategic choices through scarcity

**Examples:**

* Health Points (survival resource)
* Gold (economic resource)
* Spell slots (ability resource)
* Investigation points (information resource)
* Stress (buffer resource)
* Army units (strategic resource)

**Key characteristic:** Resources are MANAGED BY the system and players make choices ABOUT them.

### Constraints: Design Boundaries

**Constraints are external factors that:**

* Limit what systems can practically do
* Affect players but aren't managed in-game
* Shape design space but aren't mechanics themselves
* Must be accommodated, not "spent"

**Examples:**

* Player attention/cognitive load
* Session length (real time available)
* Group coordination difficulty
* Emotional safety boundaries
* Player skill/experience level

**Key characteristic:** Constraints are ON the system, not IN the system.

### Why This Distinction Matters

**Problem:** Designers often conflate these, leading to confusion.

**Example confusion:**
"Player attention is a resource we must manage"

* ❌ Wrong framing: Attention can't be "spent" or "recovered" like HP
* ✅ Right framing: Attention is a constraint that limits complexity budget

**Example confusion:**
"Time is a resource in real-time games"

* ❌ Wrong framing if meaning real-world time (that's a constraint)
* ✅ Right framing if meaning in-game time pressure (that's a mechanic)

**The test:**

* Can players make strategic choices about allocating it? → Resource
* Does it limit what's feasible in game design? → Constraint

### Where Cognitive Load Fits

**Cognitive load is a CONSTRAINT, not a resource.**

Why this matters:

* You can't "spend brainspace" and have less for later
* You can't "trade attention" with another player
* Complexity doesn't deplete and recover like HP

However, cognitive load deeply affects resource design:

* Complex resource tracking increases cognitive load
* Simple resources free up attention for other gameplay
* Design question: "Is tracking this resource worth the cognitive overhead?"

**Cross-reference:** See separate document "Cognitive Load and System Complexity" for detailed analysis of how player attention shapes design space.

### Design Implication

**When designing resources, ask:**

1. Is this thing players will make strategic choices about? (If yes → resource)
2. Or is this a limit on what players can handle? (If yes → constraint)

**Don't call everything a resource just because it's scarce.** Reserve the term for in-game mechanics that players actively manage.

## Aesthetic Framework: What Experiences Do Resources Create?

### Starting from MDA

We use the **MDA (Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics) framework** as our foundation for understanding how resources create experiences.

**MDA's insight:** Games are designed backwards from player experience:

* **Aesthetics:** The emotional/experiential goals (what players feel)
* **Dynamics:** The behavior that emerges from mechanics in play
* **Mechanics:** The rules and systems (including resources)

**For resource design:** Start with aesthetic goal → determine what dynamics you need → design resource mechanics to create those dynamics.

### MDA's Eight Aesthetics

From Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek (2004):

1. **Sensation:** Sensory pleasure (beautiful, visceral, immersive)
2. **Fantasy:** Make-believe, imagining yourself in another world
3. **Narrative:** Story and drama
4. **Challenge:** Obstacle course, overcoming difficulty
5. **Fellowship:** Social framework, playing with others
6. **Discovery:** Exploration, finding new things
7. **Expression:** Self-discovery, creativity
8. **Submission:** Pastime, relaxation, "turning brain off"

### Limitations of MDA's List

**MDA's eight aesthetics are valuable but incomplete** for our purposes. Through analyzing resource systems across multiple games, we've identified additional aesthetic goals not fully captured by MDA:

**Additional aesthetic goals:**

**Mastery:** Getting deeply skilled at understanding and optimizing systems

* Related to Challenge but distinct: Not just overcoming difficulty, but understanding deeply
* Example: Chess players studying openings, Slay the Spire players calculating draw pile odds
* Requires: Systems with sufficient depth to repay study

**Tension:** Adrenaline, time pressure, high-stakes decisions

* Related to Sensation but distinct: Not sensory pleasure but psychological pressure
* Example: StarCraft real-time decision-making, XCOM Ironman permadeath
* Requires: Consequences that matter, pressure to decide quickly

**Progression:** Growth, becoming more powerful over time

* Related to Expression but distinct: Not about creativity but advancement
* Example: Leveling up, unlocking abilities, empire building
* Requires: Accumulation mechanics, power curve

**Collection/Completion:** Accumulation, completionism, "gotta catch 'em all"

* Related to Discovery but distinct: Not about finding new things but possessing all things
* Example: Pokemon collection, achievement hunting, card collecting
* Requires: Finite sets to complete, tracking what's missing

### Our Expanded Framework

**For this document series, we use:**

* **MDA's eight aesthetics as foundation** (established, well-understood)
* **Plus four additional aesthetic goals** identified through game analysis
* **With acknowledgment** that this list is still not exhaustive

**Why expand MDA?**

* Our game analyses revealed aesthetic goals not well-described by MDA's eight
* Resource design specifically benefits from distinguishing these goals
* Better to be precise than force patterns into ill-fitting categories

**When to use which:**

* MDA's original eight cover most cases
* Additional four clarify specific resource design patterns
* Both are tools, not dogma

### How Resources Map to Aesthetics

Different resource designs serve different aesthetic goals:

**Challenge aesthetic needs:**

* Scarcity that forces difficult choices
* Consequences for poor resource management
* Optimization opportunities
* Example: HoMM3 permanent army loss

**Fellowship aesthetic needs:**

* Simple resources (free up brainspace for socializing)
* Shared resources or trading mechanics
* Visible game state (enable discussion)
* Example: Catan's five resources + trading

**Narrative aesthetic needs:**

* Resources that tell story (stress/harm accumulation)
* Asymmetric recovery (different time scales)
* Consequences that become character history
* Example: Blades in the Dark trauma

**Mastery aesthetic needs:**

* Depth that rewards study
* Optimization space
* Systems that scale with understanding
* Example: Slay the Spire deck composition

**Tension aesthetic needs:**

* High stakes (permanent or slow-recovering losses)
* Time pressure or urgency
* Risk/reward decisions
* Example: Slay the Spire HP as permanent resource

**Submission aesthetic needs:**

* Simple resource management (minimal cognitive load)
* Forgiving (abundant resources, fast recovery)
* Low stakes (mistakes don't cascade)
* Example: Modern WoW (fast HP recovery, minimal downtime)

### Design Principle: Aesthetic Alignment

**Principle:** Every resource design choice should serve your aesthetic goals. Resources that don't serve the intended experience are at best unnecessary complexity, at worst actively harmful.

**Examples of misalignment:**

❌ **Complex resource tracking in Fellowship game**

* Want: Social interaction and negotiation
* Have: 10 resource types requiring calculation
* Result: Players do math instead of talking
* Fix: Simplify (Catan's 5 resources vs 18XX's complexity)

❌ **Abundant/fast-recovering resources in Challenge game**

* Want: Difficult optimization decisions
* Have: Resources refresh constantly, always abundant
* Result: No meaningful scarcity, no hard choices
* Fix: Slow recovery or permanent loss (HoMM3 army units)

❌ **Highly punishing resources in Submission game**

* Want: Relaxing, low-stress pastime
* Have: Permanent consequences, harsh penalties
* Result: Anxiety, not relaxation
* Fix: Forgiving recovery, low stakes (mobile puzzle games)

✅ **Stress/Harm separation in Narrative game (Blades in the Dark)**

* Want: Character arc of veteran getting worn down
* Have: Fast-recovering buffer (stress) + slow-recovering consequences (harm)
* Result: Mechanics create "grizzled criminal" story through play
* Works because: Resource design directly serves narrative aesthetic

### Using This Framework

**For each resource in your design, ask:**

1. **What aesthetic goal does this serve?** (Which experience are you creating?)
2. **How does this resource's scarcity/recovery/spending create that aesthetic?**
3. **Could a simpler design serve the same aesthetic?** (Complexity budget check)
4. **Does this resource conflict with other aesthetic goals?** (Trade-off awareness)

If you can't clearly answer question 1, the resource might not belong in your game.

## Scope and Boundaries

### What These Documents Cover

**In scope:**

* In-game resources that players manage strategically
* How resource design creates aesthetic experiences
* Patterns across different game types and genres
* Design principles for choosing resource systems
* Common mistakes and how to avoid them
* Connection between resource design and aesthetic goals

**Examples covered:**

* Tabletop RPGs (Blades in the Dark, D\&D)
* Strategy games (Heroes of Might and Magic III, Civilization)
* Board games (Settlers of Catan)
* MMORPGs (World of Warcraft)
* Roguelikes (Slay the Spire)

### What These Documents Don't Cover

**Out of scope (covered in other documents):**

**Cognitive Load and System Complexity**

* Player attention as design constraint
* When complexity helps vs. harms
* Real-time vs. turn-based implications
* Offloading strategies (to GM, to automation)
* See separate document on cognitive load

**Balance and Parameter Optimization**

* Specific numbers (how much HP, exact costs)
* Mathematical balance frameworks
* Tuning and playtesting methodologies
* See separate document on balance

**Implementation Details**

* Code architecture
* UI/UX for resource display
* Technical considerations
* See implementation documents

**Worldbuilding**

* How resources fit into fiction
* Diegetic vs. non-diegetic resources
* See separate document on worldbuilding

**Specific Genre Advice**

* Unless generalizable to other contexts
* Example: "Mystery games need investigation points" is too narrow
* But: "Core experience resources should be non-gatable" is general

### Why These Boundaries?

**Cognitive load is related but distinct:**

* Complex resources increase cognitive load
* But cognitive load principles apply beyond just resources
* Deserves separate, focused treatment
* We note connections but don't duplicate coverage

**Balance is downstream from resource design:**

* First: Decide what resources serve your aesthetic
* Then: Tune numbers to achieve desired experience
* Balance is important but separate concern

**Implementation is context-dependent:**

* Tabletop vs. video game have different considerations
* Technical details vary by platform
* Principles are universal, implementation is specific

## Foundation for What Follows

### The Journey Ahead

**Documents 2-5 cover resource mechanics:**

* When to use resources (Doc 2)
* What types exist (Doc 3)
* How scarcity works (Doc 4)
* How recovery patterns shape play (Doc 5)

**Documents 6-8 cover resource dynamics:**

* How players interact with resources (Doc 6)
* Social aspects of resources (Doc 7)
* Psychological effects (Doc 8)

**Documents 9-10 synthesize and apply:**

* What to avoid (Doc 9)
* How to make decisions (Doc 10)

### Key Themes

**Throughout all documents, you'll see:**

1. **Aesthetic-first thinking** - Experience determines mechanics, not reverse
2. **Pattern recognition** - Same principles appear across different games
3. **Trade-offs** - Every choice has costs, no perfect solutions
4. **Context matters** - What works for one aesthetic may fail for another
5. **Simplicity when possible** - Complexity must earn its keep

### Building on Existing Work

**These documents build on:**

* MDA framework (Hunicke, LeBlanc, Zubek, 2004)
* 50+ lessons from system evolution analysis (D\&D, PbtA, Civ, XCOM)
* Games as experiential scaffolds concept
* Detailed analysis of five diverse game systems

**This is not abstract theory** - every principle comes from analyzing real games and their design choices.

## Ready to Begin

Now that we've established:

* What resources are (and aren't)
* How resources relate to aesthetic goals
* Our expanded aesthetic framework
* How to use these documents

We can explore resource management in depth.

**Next:** Document 2 - Should This Be A Resource?

The most important question in resource design: When does tracking something serve your aesthetic, and when does it just add complexity?

***

## Quick Reference: Key Concepts

**Resource:** In-game entity players manage strategically through acquisition and spending

**Constraint:** External factor that limits what's feasible in design (not managed in-game)

**Aesthetic:** The emotional/experiential goal (what players should feel)

**MDA Framework:** Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics (design backwards from experience)

**Aesthetic Alignment:** Resources should serve intended aesthetic, not work against it

**Our Expanded Aesthetics:**

* MDA's 8: Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression, Submission
* Plus 4: Mastery, Tension, Progression, Collection

**Design Question:** "What experience do we want, and what resources create that experience?"
