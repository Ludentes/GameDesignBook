# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Document 2: Should This Be A Resource?

***

## The Most Important Question

Before deciding *what* resources to have or *how* they should work, ask the fundamental question:

**"Should this thing be a resource at all?"**

Not everything that *could* be tracked *should* be tracked. Every resource adds:

* Cognitive overhead (players must understand and manage it)
* System complexity (more rules, more interactions)
* Development cost (more to implement, balance, explain)

Resources must **earn their place** by serving the aesthetic experience.

***

## High-Level Principle: Resources as Strategic Filters

✅ **Validated across multiple games**

**Principle:** Resources create meaningful experiences by filtering possibilities and forcing prioritization. When something is scarce, choices about it become interesting. When something is abundant or automatic, it fades into background.

**Implication:** Make something a resource when you want players to think strategically about it. Don't make it a resource if you want it to be automatic or invisible.

### The Filter Metaphor

Think of resources as **strategic filters**:

**Abundant/Automatic:** Everything passes through (no filter)

* Players can do anything without constraint
* No meaningful choice required
* Example: Unlimited movement in turn-based game with no time pressure

**Scarce/Managed:** Filter forces prioritization (active choice)

* Players must decide what's important
* Every choice has opportunity cost
* Example: Limited movement points per turn (Heroes of Might and Magic III)

**The filter creates the experience:**

* No filter → No decisions → No challenge
* Too restrictive filter → No options → No agency
* Right filter → Meaningful choices → Engaging gameplay

### Examples of Filter in Action

**Slay the Spire - Card additions as filtered choice:**

* After combat: Choose 1 of 3 cards to add (or skip)
* **The filter:** Must choose, can only take one
* **Creates experience:** "Which card improves my deck? Or should I skip to keep deck thin?"
* **If no filter:** Could take all three cards → deck would bloat → no curation skill

**Catan - Hand limit as filter:**

* Robber forces discard if 8+ cards
* **The filter:** Can't safely hoard above 7 cards
* **Creates experience:** "Must trade/build before I lose resources"
* **If no filter:** Optimal strategy is hoard until overwhelming advantage → runaway leader problem

**Blades in the Dark - Downtime actions as filter:**

* Limited to 2-4 actions between scores
* **The filter:** Can't recover stress AND heal harm AND work on project
* **Creates experience:** "What matters most to my character?"
* **If no filter:** Could do everything → no character-defining choices

***

## Decision Framework: When to Make Something a Resource

### Question 1: Does This Serve Your Aesthetic?

**Ask:** "What aesthetic experience am I trying to create, and does tracking this support it?"

#### If Aesthetic is CHALLENGE/MASTERY:

✓ **Make it a resource if:** Optimization of this thing is interesting

* Example: Spell slots in D\&D (tactical resource management)
* Creates: Strategic depth through scarcity

✗ **Don't make it a resource if:** It adds complexity without deepening decisions

* Counter-example: Tracking arrow count in D\&D (tedious bookkeeping)
* Creates: Annoyance without meaningful choice

#### If Aesthetic is NARRATIVE/FANTASY:

✓ **Make it a resource if:** It reinforces theme or creates story

* Example: Stress/Harm in Blades (mechanizes character arc)
* Creates: "Grizzled veteran getting worn down" through mechanics

✗ **Don't make it a resource if:** Tracking interrupts immersion

* Counter-example: Detailed encumbrance in narrative-focused game
* Creates: Math that breaks fiction

#### If Aesthetic is FELLOWSHIP:

✓ **Make it a resource if:** It creates interdependence or negotiation

* Example: Trading in Catan (forces social interaction)
* Creates: "I need brick, anyone have brick?" conversations

✗ **Don't make it a resource if:** It increases cognitive load without social benefit

* Counter-example: Complex individual resource tracking in party game
* Creates: Players calculating alone instead of socializing

#### If Aesthetic is TENSION:

✓ **Make it a resource if:** Scarcity creates pressure and stakes

* Example: HP in Slay the Spire (permanent, limited recovery)
* Creates: "Can I afford this fight?" risk assessment

✗ **Don't make it a resource if:** It adds tracking without raising stakes

* Counter-example: Abundant fast-recovering resource
* Creates: Busywork without tension

#### If Aesthetic is SUBMISSION (relaxation):

✓ **Make it a resource if:** It's simple and forgiving

* Example: Energy in mobile puzzle games (regenerates automatically)
* Creates: Gentle pacing without stress

✗ **Don't make it a resource if:** It requires optimization or has harsh penalties

* Counter-example: Complex resource juggling with permadeath
* Creates: Anxiety instead of relaxation

### Question 2: Does Scarcity Create Interesting Decisions?

**Ask:** "If this thing is limited, do choices about it become meaningful?"

**The test:**

1. Imagine players have unlimited amount of this thing
2. Would gameplay change significantly?
3. If yes → might be good resource
4. If no → probably shouldn't be resource

**Example: HP in combat games**

* Unlimited HP: No risk, no tension, no need to defend
* Limited HP: Must balance offense/defense, tactical positioning matters
* **Verdict:** HP works as resource (scarcity creates meaningful gameplay)

**Example: Rope/climbing gear in fantasy game**

* Unlimited rope: Players can always climb
* Limited rope: Players... count rope? Try to avoid climbing?
* **Verdict:** Probably shouldn't be resource (scarcity creates annoyance, not interesting decisions)

> **Note:** This is context-dependent! In survival game focused on preparation, rope scarcity might create interesting "did I bring enough?" decisions. But in combat-focused game, it's just bookkeeping.

### Question 3: Can Players Make Strategic Choices About It?

**Ask:** "Can players decide how/when to acquire, spend, or conserve this thing?"

**Resources require agency:**

* Players must be able to influence acquisition
* Players must have meaningful options for spending
* Scarcity without agency = frustration, not strategy

**Good agency example - Stress in Blades:**

* Acquisition: You choose whether to take stress (resist consequence) or accept harm
* Spending: You decide when to push yourself using stress
* Conservation: You can play conservatively to avoid stress
* **Result:** Players feel in control of stress management

**Bad agency example - RNG loot drops:**

* Acquisition: Purely random, no player influence
* Spending: Use or don't use (limited decision)
* Conservation: Just hoard until needed
* **Result:** Excitement from luck but not strategic resource management

> **Note:** RNG loot can work for Discovery aesthetic (excitement of finding things) but doesn't create Challenge/Mastery aesthetic (no optimization skill).

### Question 4: Is There a Critical Path Dependency?

**Ask:** "If players run out of this resource, can the game still progress?"

⚠️ **Critical warning:** Never make critical path progression dependent on a depletable resource.

**The problem:** If core progress requires a resource that can be used up, players can get stuck.

**Classic failure - D\&D investigation with skill checks:**

* Core clues require Perception checks
* Can fail check and miss clue
* Mystery cannot progress without clues
* **Result:** Investigation stalls, game breaks

**Fix - Gumshoe system:**

* Core clues are automatic (not a resource)
* Investigation points buy OPTIONAL depth
* **Result:** Progress guaranteed, resource creates depth not gates

> **Anti-Pattern: Critical Path Resources**
> Never gate essential progress behind depletable resources. Core experience should not be blockable by resource exhaustion.
>
> **Wrong:** "Must have Investigation Points to find crucial clue"
> **Right:** "Crucial clue is automatic, Investigation Points reveal additional context"

### Question 5: Does It Add Complexity Worth Its Weight?

**Ask:** "Is the cognitive overhead of tracking this worth the gameplay it creates?"

**Complexity budget principle:**

* Every game has limited player attention (see Cognitive Load document)
* Every resource consumes some attention
* Must justify complexity with meaningful gameplay

**High value-to-complexity ratio:**

* **Stress in Blades:** Single number (0-9), but creates push-your-luck, episodic pacing, and character progression
* **Energy in Slay the Spire:** Simple (3 per turn), but all tactical decisions revolve around it

**Low value-to-complexity ratio:**

* **Encumbrance in D\&D 5e:** Track weight of all items, rarely matters, most groups ignore
* **Too many currencies in MMOs:** Players confused about which token for which vendor

**The trade-off:**

* Simple resource + high impact = excellent
* Complex resource + high impact = acceptable (if complexity serves purpose)
* Simple resource + low impact = questionable (why track it?)
* Complex resource + low impact = **cut it**

***

## Mid-Level Guidelines: Categories of Resource Candidates

### Things That Often SHOULD Be Resources

#### 1. Survival Pressure

* **HP, shields, armor**
* Why: Creates tension, risk/reward decisions, tactical positioning
* Serves: Challenge, Tension aesthetics
* Example: HP in XCOM, Slay the Spire

#### 2. Action Economy

* **Movement points, action points, energy**
* Why: Forces prioritization of actions, creates turn optimization
* Serves: Challenge, Mastery aesthetics
* Example: Movement in HoMM3, Energy in Slay the Spire

#### 3. Economic Investment

* **Gold, building resources, currency**
* Why: Creates strategic planning, investment decisions, trade-offs
* Serves: Mastery, Progression aesthetics
* Example: Resources in HoMM3, Gold in most RPGs

#### 4. Ability Gating

* **Mana, spell slots, cooldowns**
* Why: Prevents spamming best abilities, creates rotation gameplay
* Serves: Challenge, Mastery aesthetics
* Example: Spell slots in D\&D, Mana in WoW

#### 5. Narrative Consequence

* **Stress, harm, corruption, trauma**
* Why: Mechanizes character arc, creates meaningful stakes
* Serves: Narrative, Fantasy aesthetics
* Example: Stress/Harm in Blades, Corruption in various games

#### 6. Social Currency

* **Reputation, favor, strings, influence**
* Why: Creates social dynamics, unlocks interactions
* Serves: Fellowship, Narrative aesthetics
* Example: Reputation in WoW, Strings in Monsterhearts

### Things That Often SHOULD NOT Be Resources

#### 1. Trivial Consumables

* **Common ammunition, basic food (in non-survival games)**
* Why: Bookkeeping without meaningful scarcity
* Usually: Ignore or handwave
* Exception: Survival games where preparation IS the game

#### 2. Obvious Necessities

* **Oxygen (unless underwater/space game), basic clothing**
* Why: Tracking doesn't create decisions, just realism overhead
* Usually: Assume characters have these
* Exception: When scarcity is core to aesthetic (survival, horror)

#### 3. Information That Should Be Automatic

* **Core clues in mysteries, critical path information**
* Why: Gating progress creates frustration, not challenge
* Usually: Give automatically, use resources for OPTIONAL depth
* Exception: Discovery aesthetic where finding is the point

#### 4. Complex Systems That Don't Affect Play

* **Detailed nutrition, realistic encumbrance (in action games)**
* Why: High complexity, low impact on core gameplay
* Usually: Simplify or cut
* Exception: Simulation games where detail IS the aesthetic

#### 5. Rapidly Consumed Trivia

* **Torches (unless dungeon crawling focus), travel rations (unless journey matters)**
* Why: Depletes too fast to be strategic, becomes chore
* Usually: Handwave or use scene-based instead of item-based
* Exception: Old-school dungeon crawls where resource management is central

## Low-Level Techniques: Specific Implementations

### Technique 1: Auto-Success for Core, Resources for Depth

**Pattern from:** Gumshoe (mystery RPG system)

**Problem:** Mystery games need players to find clues, but random failure blocks progress

**Solution:**

* Core clues: Automatic if you look in right place
* Investigation points: Spend to get bonus clues, context, or advantages
* **Result:** Progress guaranteed, resource creates depth not gates

**Applicable to:** Any game where certain information is essential

**Example applications:**

* Social game: Core social info automatic, Influence points for advantages
* Exploration game: Key locations findable, Surveying points for detail/shortcuts
* Combat game: Basic tactics clear, Tactical Analysis points for enemy weaknesses

✅ **Validated:** Gumshoe system, widely adopted in mystery games

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Serves: Challenge (optional depth), Narrative (maintains flow)
* ✗ Conflicts with: Discovery (if finding itself is the challenge)

### Technique 2: Escalating Costs

**Pattern from:** Many games (Magic: The Gathering, Slay the Spire)

**Problem:** Players optimize same strong option repeatedly

**Solution:**

* First use: Cheap/free
* Subsequent uses: More expensive or weaker
* **Result:** Encourages variety, prevents dominant strategy

**Example - Magic: The Gathering mana costs:**

* Weak creatures: 1-2 mana (can play multiple early)
* Strong creatures: 5+ mana (only late game)
* Most powerful: 7+ mana (rare, must build towards)

**Example - Stress in Blades:**

* First few stress: Easy to take (resist consequences freely)
* Approaching 9: Dangerous (risk trauma)
* At 9: Cannot take more (must recover or suffer trauma)

⚠️ **Hypothesis:** Escalating costs create natural pacing and variety

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Serves: Mastery (optimization around curve), Progression (power curve)
* ✗ Conflicts with: Submission (creates pressure, not relaxation)

### Technique 3: Opportunity Cost Tracking

**Pattern from:** Catan, many Eurogames

**Problem:** Want resource scarcity without complex tracking

**Solution:**

* Simple resources (easy to track)
* Multiple uses for each resource
* Limited acquisition
* **Result:** Scarcity through competition for uses, not complex management

**Example - Catan:**

* Only 5 resource types (simple)
* Each needed for different buildings (multiple uses)
* Production limited by dice + placement (acquisition constraint)
* **Result:** "Do I build road or settlement?" opportunity cost

**Example - Campfires in Slay the Spire:**

* Limited campfires per act
* Can rest (heal) OR upgrade card (power)
* Cannot do both
* **Result:** "Survival now or power later?" meaningful choice

✅ **Validated:** Common pattern in successful strategy games

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Serves: Challenge (meaningful trade-offs), Mastery (optimization)
* \~ Neutral: Most other aesthetics (depends on implementation)

### Technique 4: Multiple Timescale Resources

**Pattern from:** Blades in the Dark

**Problem:** Want both immediate tactics and long-term consequences

**Solution:**

* Fast-recovering resource (tactical layer)
* Slow-recovering resource (strategic layer)
* Different decisions at different time scales
* **Result:** Depth without overwhelming complexity

**Example - Blades:**

* Stress: Recovers between scores (tactical - per session)
* Harm: Recovers slowly over downtime (strategic - across campaign)
* Trauma: Permanent (long-term character arc)
* **Result:** Three layers of decision-making

⚠️ **Hypothesis:** Multiple timescales create richer experience without proportional complexity increase

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Serves: Narrative (character arc), Mastery (multiple strategic layers)
* ✗ Conflicts with: Submission (too much to track)

### Technique 5: Composition Over Accumulation

**Pattern from:** Slay the Spire, deckbuilding games

**Problem:** "More is better" leads to bloated, unfocused strategies

**Solution:**

* Quality > quantity (thin deck often better)
* Removal mechanics (can remove cards)
* Choice on acquisition (can skip adding cards)
* **Result:** Curation is skill, not just accumulation

**Example - Slay the Spire:**

* Starting deck: 10 basic cards
* After combat: Choose 1 of 3 cards or skip
* At shop: Pay to remove cards
* **Result:** "Does this card improve my deck?" strategic question

✅ **Validated:** Deckbuilders, some RPG builds (quality over quantity)

**Aesthetic alignment:**

* ✓ Serves: Mastery (optimization through curation), Challenge (meaningful choices)
* ✗ Conflicts with: Collection (if goal is accumulation itself)

***

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Resource for Realism, Not Gameplay

> **Anti-Pattern: Simulationist Overhead**
> Adding resources because they're "realistic" without considering gameplay value.

**Example:** Detailed nutrition tracking in action RPG

* **Why added:** "Characters need to eat in real life"
* **What it creates:** Tedious shopping, inventory management
* **What it doesn't create:** Meaningful decisions (just buy food constantly)
* **Fix:** Either make food scarcity meaningful (survival game) or handwave it

**Lesson:** Realism is not inherently valuable. Only add realistic constraints if they serve aesthetic.

### Pitfall 2: Too Many Currencies

> **Anti-Pattern: Currency Proliferation**
> Adding multiple parallel currencies without clear purpose for each.

**Example:** MMO with 10+ token types

* Valor tokens (weekly cap, buy gear)
* Justice tokens (uncapped, buy lower gear)
* Conquest tokens (PvP weekly cap)
* Honor points (PvP uncapped)
* \[... 6 more types]
* **Result:** Players confused, need spreadsheet to track

**Why it happens:** Each designer adds currency for their system, no holistic view

**Fix:** Consolidate currencies, ensure each serves distinct purpose

**Lesson:** More currencies ≠ more depth. Often creates confusion over choices.

### Pitfall 3: Critical Path Gating

> **Anti-Pattern: Progress-Blocking Resources**
> Making core progression dependent on depletable resource.

**Example:** Must spend rare item to access final boss

* **Problem:** Players might have used item earlier
* **Result:** Cannot complete game, must restart or grind
* **Emotional impact:** Betrayal, frustration

**Example:** Investigation skill checks for crucial clues

* **Problem:** Failed roll = missed clue
* **Result:** Mystery cannot be solved
* **Emotional impact:** Confusion, stalled narrative

**Fix:** Never gate critical path behind depletable resource. Core progress should be guaranteed, resources add richness/depth.

**Lesson:** Resources should create challenge in HOW you progress, not WHETHER you progress.

### Pitfall 4: Vestigial Resources

> **Anti-Pattern: Ignored Resources**
> Resources that exist in rules but players don't meaningfully engage with.

**Example:** Encumbrance in D\&D 5e

* **Rules exist:** Track weight of all items
* **What happens:** Most groups ignore it completely
* **Why:** High tracking cost, low gameplay impact
* **Result:** Dead rule, wasted design space

**Example:** Arrows in many RPGs

* **Rules exist:** Track arrow count
* **What happens:** Players buy 100 arrows, never track
* **Why:** Trivially abundant, tedious to count
* **Result:** Busywork without scarcity

**Fix:** If resource is consistently ignored, either make it matter (real scarcity) or cut it.

**Lesson:** Resources players don't engage with should be removed. They add complexity without value.

### Pitfall 5: False Scarcity

> **Anti-Pattern: Theoretical Scarcity Without Practical Limit**
> Resource that seems limited but never actually runs out.

**Example:** Mana in easy RPG

* **Nominal scarcity:** Mana bar exists, abilities cost mana
* **Practical reality:** Mana so abundant it never runs out
* **Result:** Players ignore resource, spam abilities
* **Impact:** Intended tactical depth doesn't exist

**Fix:** Either make scarcity real (limited mana matters) or remove the resource (abilities just have cooldowns).

**Lesson:** If resource is never actually scarce, it's not creating meaningful decisions. Either make scarcity real or cut it.

## Decision Checklist

Before adding a resource to your game, answer these questions:

### Must Answer "Yes"

* [ ] Does this serve my aesthetic goals? (Which aesthetic and how?)
* [ ] Does scarcity of this create interesting decisions?
* [ ] Can players make strategic choices about it? (Agency check)
* [ ] Is the complexity worth the gameplay? (Value-to-overhead ratio)

### Must Answer "No"

* [ ] Does running out block critical path? (No progress-gating)
* [ ] Is this just for realism without gameplay? (No simulationist overhead)
* [ ] Do players consistently ignore this? (No vestigial resources)
* [ ] Is scarcity purely theoretical? (No false scarcity)

### Bonus Questions

* [ ] Have I considered simpler alternatives? (Complexity budget)
* [ ] Does this conflict with other aesthetic goals? (Trade-off awareness)
* [ ] Can this resource be combined with others? (Consolidation check)
* [ ] What happens when players run out? (Failure mode analysis)

**If any "Must Answer Yes" is No, or any "Must Answer No" is Yes:** Reconsider whether this should be a resource.

***

## Summary: When to Make Something a Resource

**Make it a resource when:**

* Scarcity creates meaningful strategic choices
* It serves your aesthetic goals directly
* Players have agency over acquisition and spending
* Complexity is justified by gameplay value

**Don't make it a resource when:**

* It's just realistic detail without gameplay impact
* Running out would block critical progress
* Players would ignore it anyway
* Simpler alternatives exist

**The fundamental test:**
"If this thing is limited, do choices about it become interesting in ways that serve my aesthetic?"

If yes → resource
If no → cut it or make it automatic

**Next:** Document 3 - Types of Resources

Now that we know WHEN to make something a resource, we'll explore WHAT KINDS of resources exist and what each type creates.
