# Resource Management in Game Systems

## Part 10: Appendices

***

## Appendix A: Connections to Other Topics

This section briefly covers how resource management connects to other game design topics that are detailed in separate documents.

### A.1: Cognitive Load and System Complexity

**Key relationship:** Resources exist in-game. Cognitive load is a player constraint that limits what resource designs are feasible.

**What cognitive load is:**

* Player mental capacity to track, understand, and optimize systems
* External constraint on design (like session length, player attention span)
* Shapes what's feasible but isn't itself a resource

**Why the distinction matters:**

* Tools for resources (scarcity, recovery, spending) don't apply to cognitive constraints
* "Brainspace" is not a resource you can spend/recover in-game
* Cognitive load limits how many/complex resources players can handle

**Design implications:**

* More complex resources → higher cognitive load
* Must justify cognitive cost with meaningful decisions
* Different aesthetics tolerate different loads:
  * Fellowship: Low (brainspace for socializing)
  * Mastery: High (optimization is the point)
  * Narrative: Low (don't break fiction with math)

**Examples:**

* **Catan:** 5 simple resources = low load, enables social play
* **Slay the Spire:** Complex deck tracking = high load, serves mastery aesthetic
* **WoW (some expansions):** Too many currencies = overwhelming, no aesthetic benefit

**See:** Cognitive Load and System Complexity (separate document, Phase 1 topic)

**Quick guideline:** For each resource, ask "Is the cognitive cost worth the decisions it creates?"

***

### A.2: Balance and Parameter Optimization

**Key relationship:** Resource design creates system structure. Balance tunes the parameters within that structure.

**What balance is:**

* Parameter optimization (how much HP? How many spell slots? What costs?)
* Tuning to achieve desired difficulty/fairness/pacing
* Numerical adjustments within designed system

**Why balance is separate from resource design:**

* Resource design: "Should wizards have spell slots?" (structural question)
* Balance: "How many slots at level 5?" (parameter question)
* Must get structure right before tuning parameters

**Common mistake:** Trying to balance fundamentally wrong resource design

* Example: D\&D investigation with skill rolls
* No amount of balance (adjusting DCs, modifiers) fixes core problem
* Wrong resource type for aesthetic (skill rolls gate critical info)
* Solution: Change resource design (make clues automatic), not parameters

**Design sequence:**

1. Choose resources based on aesthetic (resource design)
2. Design recovery/spending mechanics (resource design)
3. Tune amounts/costs/rates (balance)
4. Playtest and iterate (both)

**Examples:**

* **Slay the Spire:** Design = 3 energy per turn (structure), Balance = card costs 0-3 (parameters)
* **Blades:** Design = stress/harm separation (structure), Balance = 9 stress max (parameter)
* **HoMM3:** Design = permanent army loss (structure), Balance = weekly recruitment amounts (parameter)

**See:** Balance and Parameter Optimization (separate document, Phase 1 topic)

**Quick guideline:** Get resource structure right first (serves aesthetic), then tune numbers.

### A.3: Worldbuilding and Context

**Key relationship:** Resources exist within fictional context. The fiction shapes what resources make sense.

**How worldbuilding affects resources:**

**Setting implications:**

* Medieval fantasy → gold, HP, spell slots make sense
* Sci-fi → energy, tech points, hull integrity fit better
* Modern detective → investigation points, relationships, reputation

**Fictional constraints:**

* Resources should make sense in world
* Abstract resources need fictional justification
* Example: "Stress" in Blades = mental/emotional strain criminals experience

**Narrative resources:**

* Some resources ARE worldbuilding elements
* Reputation, relationships, faction standing
* Track both mechanically and fictionally

**Design principle:** Resources should reinforce fiction, not contradict it

**Examples:**

* **Blades harm:** Descriptive (Broken Leg) reinforces fiction better than abstract (-2 DEX)
* **D\&D spell slots:** Abstract but fits "magic is exhausting" fiction
* **Catan resources:** Brick/Lumber/Ore are literal materials in fiction

**See:** Worldbuilding (Phase 1 topic, future document)

**Quick guideline:** Can you explain this resource in the fiction? If not, reconsider it.

***

### A.4: System Functions

**Key relationship:** Resources are tools for implementing system functions.

**Note**: The following describes how resources interact with game systems. For the complete System Functions framework applicable to all game systems (not just resources), see Writing Guidelines Part 1 and Chapter 1, Section 5: System Functions.

**The 7 System Functions** (from "What is a Game System" document and Writing Guidelines Part 1):

**Function 1: Adjudication** - Resolving uncertainty

* Resources can be spent to influence outcomes (Blades stress for better roll)
* Resources modify resolution mechanics (gear bonuses, spell slots)

**Function 2: Information Management** - Controlling what players know

* Resources can gate information (but careful with critical info!)
* Example: Investigation points for optional clues (Gumshoe)

**Function 3: Content Generation** - Creating situations

* Resources enable content (gold buys quests, crew coin opens scores)
* Accumulation unlocks new scenarios

**Function 4: State Persistence** - Remembering across sessions

* Resources track long-term state (trauma, faction reputation, wealth)
* Persistence creates campaign arcs (Blades trauma accumulation)

**Function 5: Cognitive Encoding** - Shaping how players think

* Resources encode priorities (HP = value life, stress = value success)
* Resource types frame strategic thinking

**Function 6: Constraint Design** - Creating meaningful limitations

* Capacity resources limit options (inventory slots, hand limits)
* Scarcity forces priorities

**Function 7: Procedural Content for Solo Play** - Enabling GM-less play

* Resources can drive oracle systems (spend to reveal)
* Less relevant for resource design, more for system architecture

**Design principle:** Each resource should serve at least one system function clearly.

**See:**

* Chapter 1: Understanding Game Systems (Section 5: System Functions) for detailed discussion
* Writing Guidelines Part 1, System Functions for applying this framework in analysis

***

### A.5: LLM Implications

**Key relationship:** LLMs change what's feasible to track, not what should be tracked.

**What LLMs enable:**

**Complex state tracking:**

* Can track many resources automatically (no manual bookkeeping)
* Perfect consistency (no tracking errors)
* Example: Exact NPC relationship values, detailed inventory

**Natural language interaction:**

* Don't need to say "I spend 2 investigation points"
* Can say "I investigate thoroughly" → LLM translates
* Removes need for mechanical vocabulary

**Adaptive resource management:**

* Can adjust scarcity based on player behavior
* Prevent starvation or excess automatically
* Example: Ensure players have resources to engage with core mechanics

**What LLMs DON'T change:**

**Fundamental design principles still apply:**

* Still need to choose what to track (don't track everything)
* Resources still need to serve aesthetic goals
* Anti-patterns still exist (don't gate critical info)
* Psychology still operates (loss aversion, hoarding, FOMO)

**Cognitive load still matters:**

* Can automate tracking, can't automate understanding
* Players still need to comprehend systems
* Complexity still has cost (even if hidden)

**Design implications:**

**Can now feasibly:**

* Track complex resource interactions (compute-intensive)
* Handle many resources (automation reduces bookkeeping)
* Adapt dynamically (responsive to player behavior)

**Should still avoid:**

* Resources that don't serve aesthetic
* Progress-blocking critical-path resources
* Manipulative FOMO mechanics
* Social toxicity patterns

**Example: LLM-Enhanced Mystery Game**

* Can track: Exact NPC memory of conversations, complex clue relationships
* Should still: Make core clues automatic (not gated by rolls)
* Benefit: NPC consistency perfect, player doesn't track manually
* Aesthetic: Same (Discovery through deduction), just better implemented

**See:** LLM Implications and Opportunities (future document)

**Quick guideline:** LLMs expand possibilities, but same aesthetic goals and design principles apply.

### A.6: Core Loops and Resource Recovery (Chapter 1, Section 4)

Resource recovery patterns directly affect loop satisfaction at different timescales:

**Fast Recovery** (seconds to minutes):

* Enables tight micro loops → aggressive play encouraged
* Players can retry immediately → supports Challenge aesthetic's learning cycles
* Example: Modern FPS health regeneration → enables continuous combat micro loop

**Moderate Recovery** (per-encounter):

* Structures core loops → episodic session pacing
* Each encounter feels complete → supports clean core loop closure
* Example: Blades stress recovers per-score → episodic heist loop

**Slow Recovery** (per-session or permanent):

* Creates meta loop pressure → long-term strategic thinking
* Consequences persist → supports Mastery aesthetic's deep planning
* Example: Blades trauma persists → meta loop of character arc management

**Key Insight**: Recovery speed isn't just "fast vs. slow"—it determines which loop level experiences scarcity pressure. Fast micro-loop resources create moment-to-moment decisions. Slow meta-loop resources create campaign-level strategy.

**See**: Chapter 1, Section 4 for complete Core Loops framework (micro/core/meta nested loops).

## Appendix B: Terminology Clarification

### B.1: Resources vs. Constraints

**This distinction is critical and often confused.**

**Resources:**

* In-game mechanical entities
* Tracked by game system
* Can be spent, recovered, traded
* Create strategic choices through mechanics
* Part of game state

**Examples:** HP, gold, spell slots, stress, investigation points, army units

**Constraints:**

* Player capacity or external limitations
* External to game state
* Can't be spent or recovered (within game mechanics)
* Design must accommodate them
* Affect what's feasible to design

**Examples:** Player attention span, cognitive load, session length, real-world time, emotional safety

**Why it matters:**

**Wrong:** "Brainspace is a resource I need to manage"

* Implies you can spend/save/trade attention like gold
* Applies wrong design tools (scarcity, recovery patterns)
* Confuses in-game mechanics with player capacity

**Right:** "Cognitive load is a constraint that limits how many resources I can feasibly track"

* Recognizes external limitation
* Applies appropriate design tools (simplification, automation)
* Keeps in-game mechanics separate from player capacity

**The relationship:**

* Complex resources increase cognitive load (resource → constraint)
* Limited attention constrains resource complexity (constraint → resource)
* They interact but are different categories

**Design implications:**

* Resources: Use scarcity, recovery, spending mechanics
* Constraints: Simplify, automate, respect limits

***

### B.2: Depletion vs. Accumulation

**Two opposite patterns often confused:**

**Depletion resources:**

* Start with amount, decreases through use
* Example: HP, ammunition, spell slots
* Creates: Attrition pressure, "running out" tension
* Question: "How much is left?"

**Accumulation resources:**

* Start at zero, increases through play
* Example: XP, gold savings, reputation
* Creates: Growth, progression, achievement
* Question: "How much have I gained?"

**Some resources do both:**

* Gold: Accumulate through earning, deplete through spending
* Stress (Blades): Accumulates during score, depletes between scores
* These are "flow" resources

**Design consideration:** Know which pattern serves your aesthetic

* Depletion: Good for Challenge, Tension (running low creates pressure)
* Accumulation: Good for Progression, Mastery (growth creates satisfaction)
* Flow: Good for economic simulation, complex strategy

***

### B.3: Recovery vs. Refresh vs. Regeneration

**Three related but distinct concepts:**

**Recovery:**

* Broad term for resource restoration
* Can be active (player action) or passive (automatic)
* Example: "HP recovers after rest"

**Refresh:**

* Complete restoration at specific intervals
* Usually tied to game structure (per turn, per scene, per day)
* Example: Slay the Spire energy refreshes to 3 each turn

**Regeneration:**

* Gradual automatic restoration over time
* Passive, continuous process
* Example: WoW HP regenerates out of combat

**Usage:**

* "Recovery" is general term (encompasses all)
* "Refresh" implies complete and scheduled
* "Regeneration" implies gradual and automatic

***

### B.4: Scarcity vs. Rarity

**Often confused but different:**

**Scarcity:**

* Limited availability for strategic reasons
* Creates decisions through shortage
* Example: Limited spell slots create "when to use?" decisions

**Rarity:**

* Uncommon occurrence or acquisition
* Creates value through exclusivity
* Example: Rare magic items feel special

**Same resource can be both:**

* Rare + scarce: Legendary items (few exist, can't have many)
* Rare + abundant: Cosmetic collectibles (uncommon drops but infinite slots)
* Common + scarce: Basic items (easy to find but limited carrying capacity)
* Common + abundant: Tutorial items (everywhere, no limit)

**Design implications:**

* Scarcity creates strategic choices (Challenge aesthetic)
* Rarity creates achievement feeling (Progression aesthetic)
* Different tools for different goals

***

### B.5: Personal vs. Shared vs. Pooled

**Three ownership models:**

**Personal:**

* Each player has own separate amount
* Example: Individual HP, individual gold
* Can't transfer between players (usually)

**Shared:**

* Group collectively owns/manages
* Decisions made together
* Example: Blades crew coin, party resources

**Pooled:**

* Individual contributions to collective pool
* Can add to pool, draw from pool
* Example: Party treasury (everyone contributes/withdraws)

**The distinction:**

* Personal: No negotiation needed
* Shared: Collective decision required
* Pooled: Individual choice to contribute/withdraw

**Social implications:**

* Personal: Individual optimization
* Shared: Group coordination, potential for quarterbacking
* Pooled: Voluntary cooperation, potential for free-riding
